Thanks to nimble collaboration, the team was able to culture the virus from two clinical specimens in a Level 3 containment facility.

“We need key tools to develop solutions to this pandemic. While the immediate response is crucial, longer-term solutions come from essential research into this novel virus,” said Dr. Samira Mubareka, microbiologist and infectious diseases physician at Sunnybrook.

The isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, evolution and clinical shedding.

“Researchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,” said Dr. Rob Kozak, clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook. “It demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate.”

Dr. Arinjay Banerjee, NSERC post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University, said he knows the collaboration won’t stop there.

“Now that we have isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we can share this with other researchers and continue this teamwork,” he said. “The more viruses that are made available in this way, the more we can learn, collaborate and share.”

Congratulations to the researchers from these three Canadian institutions: Dr. Samira Mubareka and Dr. Rob Kozak of Sunnybrook and University of Toronto; Dr. Arinjay Banerjee and Dr. Karen Mossman of McMaster University.

With gratitude to the CL3 team and Biosafety Officers.

https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-0504,"This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.

A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.

Using news reports and press releases from provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China, this analysis estimates the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and its public health implications.

In December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The initial cluster was epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, although many of the initial 41 cases were later reported to have no known exposure to the market (1). A novel strain of coronavirus belonging to the same family of viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the 4 human coronaviruses associated with the common cold, was subsequently isolated from lower respiratory tract samples of 4 cases on 7 January 2020 (2). Infection with the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can be asymptomatic or can result in mild to severe symptomatic disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) (3). On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and more than 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide as of 28 February 2020 (4, 5). On 31 January 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that all citizens returning from Hubei province, China, would be subject to mandatory quarantine for up to 14 days (6).

Our current understanding of the incubation period for COVID-19 is limited. An early analysis based on 88 confirmed cases in Chinese provinces outside Wuhan, using data on known travel to and from Wuhan to estimate the exposure interval, indicated a mean incubation period of 6.4 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 7.7 days), with a range of 2.1 to 11.1 days (7). Another analysis based on 158 confirmed cases outside Wuhan estimated a median incubation period of 5.0 days (CI, 4.4 to 5.6 days), with a range of 2 to 14 days (8). These estimates are generally consistent with estimates from 10 confirmed cases in China (mean incubation period, 5.2 days [CI, 4.1 to 7.0 days] [9]) and from clinical reports of a familial cluster of COVID-19 in which symptom onset occurred 3 to 6 days after assumed exposure in Wuhan (1). These estimates of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 are also in line with those of other known human coronaviruses, including SARS (mean, 5 days; range, 2 to 14 days [10]), MERS (mean, 5 to 7 days; range, 2 to 14 days [11]), and non-SARS human coronavirus (mean, 3 days; range, 2 to 5 days [12]).

The incubation period can inform several important public health activities for infectious diseases, including active monitoring, surveillance, control, and modeling. Active monitoring requires potentially exposed persons to contact local health authorities to report their health status every day. Understanding the length of active monitoring needed to limit the risk for missing SARS-CoV-2 infections is necessary for health departments to effectively use limited resources. In this article, we provide estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 and the number of symptomatic infections missed under different active monitoring scenarios.

Methods

Data Collection

We searched for news and public health reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases in areas with no known community transmission, including provinces, regions, and countries outside Hubei. We searched for reports in both English and Chinese and abstracted the data necessary to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. Two authors independently reviewed the full text of each case report. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus.

For each case, we recorded the time of possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2, any symptom onset, fever onset, and case detection. The exact time of events was used when possible; otherwise, we defined conservative upper and lower bounds for the possible interval of each event. For most cases, the interval of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as the time between the earliest possible arrival to and latest possible departure from Wuhan. For cases without history of travel to Wuhan but with assumed exposure to an infectious person, the interval of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as the maximum possible interval of exposure to the infectious person, including time before the infectious person was symptomatic. We allowed for the possibility of continued exposure within known clusters (for example, families traveling together) when the ordering of transmission was unclear. We assumed that exposure always preceded symptom onset. If we were unable to determine the latest exposure time from the available case report, we defined the upper bound of the exposure interval to be the latest possible time of symptom onset. When the earliest possible time of exposure could not be determined, we defined it as 1 December 2019, the date of symptom onset in the first known case (1); we performed a sensitivity analysis for the selection of this universal lower bound. When the earliest possible time of symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed it to be the earliest time of possible exposure. When the latest time of possible symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed it to be the latest time of possible case detection. Data on age, sex, country of residence, and possible exposure route were also collected.

Statistical Analysis

Cases were included in the analysis if we had information on the interval of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and symptom onset. We estimated the incubation time using a previously described parametric accelerated failure time model (13). For our primary analysis, we assumed that the incubation time follows a log-normal distribution, as seen in other acute respiratory viral infections (12). We fit the model to all observations, as well as to only cases where the patient had fever and only those detected inside or outside mainland China in subset analyses. Finally, we also fit 3 other commonly used incubation period distributions (gamma, Weibull, and Erlang). We estimated median incubation time and important quantiles (2.5th, 25th, 75th, and 97.5th percentiles) along with their bootstrapped CIs for each model.

Using these estimates of the incubation period, we quantified the expected number of undetected symptomatic cases in an active monitoring program, adapting a method detailed by Reich and colleagues (14). We accounted for varying durations of the active monitoring program (1 to 28 days) and individual risk for symptomatic infection (low risk: 1-in-10 000 chance of infection; medium risk: 1-in-1000 chance; high risk: 1-in-100 chance; infected: 1-in-1 chance). For each bootstrapped set of parameter estimates from the log-normal model, we calculated the probability of a symptomatic infection developing after an active monitoring program of a given length for a given risk level. This model conservatively assumes that persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 immediately before the active monitoring program and assumes perfect ascertainment of symptomatic cases that develop under active monitoring. We report the mean and 99th percentile of the expected number of undetected symptomatic cases for each active monitoring scenario.

All estimates are based on persons who developed symptoms, and this work makes no inferences about asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. The analyses were conducted using the coarseDataTools and activemonitr packages in the R statistical programming language, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). All code and data are available at https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/ncov_incubation (release at time of submission at https://zenodo.org/record/3692048) (15).

Results

We collected data from 181 cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection detected outside Hubei province before 24 February 2020 (Table 1). Of these, 69 (38%) were female, 108 were male (60%), and 4 (2%) were of unknown sex. The median age was 44.5 years (interquartile range, 34.0 to 55.5 years). Cases were collected from 24 countries and regions outside mainland China (n = 108) and 25 provinces within mainland China (n = 73). Most cases (n = 161) had a known recent history of travel to or residence in Wuhan; others had evidence of contact with travelers from Hubei or persons with known infection. Among those who developed symptoms in the community, the median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 1.2 days (range, 0.2 to 29.9 days) (Figure 1).

Shaded regions represent the full possible time intervals for exposure, symptom onset, and case detection; points represent the midpoints of these intervals. SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Fitting the log-normal model to all cases, we estimated the median incubation period of COVID-19 to be 5.1 days (CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days) (Figure 2). We estimated that fewer than 2.5% of infected persons will show symptoms within 2.2 days (CI, 1.8 to 2.9 days) of exposure, and symptom onset will occur within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) for 97.5% of infected persons. The estimate of the dispersion parameter was 1.52 (CI, 1.32 to 1.72), and the estimated mean incubation period was 5.5 days.

We estimated that fewer than 2.5% of infected persons will display symptoms within 2.2 days (CI, 1.8 to 2.9 days) of exposure, whereas symptom onset will occur within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) for 97.5% of infected persons. Horizontal bars represent the 95% CIs of the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles of the incubation period distribution. The estimate of the dispersion parameter is 1.52 (CI, 1.32 to 1.72). COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019.

To control for possible bias from symptoms of cough or sore throat, which could have been caused by other more common pathogens, we performed the same analysis on the subset of cases with known time of fever onset (n = 99), using the time from exposure to onset of fever as the incubation time. We estimated the median incubation period to fever onset to be 5.7 days (CI, 4.9 to 6.8 days), with 2.5% of persons experiencing fever within 2.6 days (CI, 2.1 to 3.7 days) and 97.5% having fever within 12.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 17.7 days) of exposure.

Because assumptions about the occurrence of local transmission and therefore the period of possible exposure may be less firm within mainland China, we also analyzed only cases detected outside mainland China (n = 108). The median incubation period for these cases was 5.5 days (CI, 4.4 to 7.0 days), with the 95% range spanning from 2.1 (CI, 1.5 to 3.2) to 14.7 (CI, 7.4 to 22.6) days. Alternatively, persons who left mainland China may represent a subset of persons with longer incubation periods, persons who were able to travel internationally before symptom onset within China, or persons who may have chosen to delay reporting symptoms until they left China. Based on cases detected inside mainland China (n = 73), the median incubation period is 4.8 days (CI, 4.2 to 5.6 days), with a 95% range of 2.5 (CI, 1.9 to 3.5) to 9.2 (CI, 6.4 to 12.5) days. Full results of these sensitivity analyses are presented in Appendix Table 1.

Appendix Table 1. Percentiles of SARS-CoV-2 Incubation Period From Selected Sensitivity Analyses*

We fit other commonly used parameterizations of the incubation period (gamma, Weibull, and Erlang distributions). The incubation period estimates for these alternate parameterizations were similar to those from the log-normal model (Appendix Table 2).

Appendix Table 2. Parameter Estimates for Various Parametric Distributions of the Incubation Period of SARS-CoV-2 Using 181 Confirmed Cases*

Given these estimates of the incubation period, we predicted the number of symptomatic infections we would expect to miss over the course of an active monitoring program. We classified persons as being at high risk if they have a 1-in-100 chance of developing a symptomatic infection after exposure. For an active monitoring program lasting 7 days, the expected number of symptomatic infections missed for every 10 000 high-risk persons monitored is 21.2 (99th percentile, 36.5) (Table 2 and Figure 3). After 14 days, it is highly unlikely that further symptomatic infections would be undetected among high-risk persons (mean, 1.0 undetected infections per 10 000 persons [99th percentile, 4.8]). However, substantial uncertainty remains in the classification of persons as being at “high,” “medium,” or “low” risk for being symptomatic, and this method does not consider the role of asymptomatic infection. We have created an application to estimate the proportion of missed COVID-19 cases across any active monitoring duration up to 100 days and various population risk levels (16).

See Table 2 for exact estimates at various time points and at different levels of population risk for symptomatic infection. SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Discussion

We present estimates of the incubation period for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in 2019. We estimated the median incubation period of COVID-19 to be 5.1 days and expect that nearly all infected persons who have symptoms will do so within 12 days of infection. We found that the current period of active monitoring recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (14 days) is well supported by the evidence (6). Symptomatic disease is frequently associated with transmissibility of a pathogen. However, given recent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic persons (17, 18), we note that time from exposure to onset of infectiousness (latent period) may be shorter than the incubation period estimated here, with important implications for transmission dynamics.

Our results are broadly consistent with other estimates of the incubation period (1, 7–9). Our analysis, which was based on 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases, made more conservative assumptions about the possible window of symptom onset and the potential for continued exposure through transmission clusters outside Wuhan. Of note, the use of fixed times of symptom onset, as used in 3 of the 4 prior analyses, will truncate the incubation period distribution by either decreasing the maximum possible incubation period (if the earliest possible time of symptom onset is used) or increasing the minimum possible incubation period (if the midpoint or latest possible time of symptom onset is used). Therefore, using a symptom onset window more accurately accounts for the full distribution of possible incubation periods.

Although our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases. Among those who are infected and will develop symptoms, we expect 101 in 10 000 (99th percentile, 482) will do so after the end of a 14-day monitoring period (Table 2 and Figure 3), and our analyses do not preclude this estimate from being higher. Although it is essential to weigh the costs of extending active monitoring or quarantine against the potential or perceived costs of failing to identify a symptomatic case, there may be high-risk scenarios (for example, a health care worker who cared for a COVID-19 patient while not wearing personal protective equipment) where it could be prudent to extend the period of active monitoring.

This analysis has several important limitations. Our data include early case reports, with associated uncertainty in the intervals of exposure and symptom onset. We have used conservative bounds of possible exposure and symptom onset where exact times were not known, but there may be further inaccuracy in these data that we have not considered. We have exclusively considered reported, confirmed cases of COVID-19, which may overrepresent hospitalized persons and others with severe symptoms, although we note that the proportion of mild cases detected has increased as surveillance and monitoring systems have been strengthened. The incubation period for these severe cases may differ from that of less severe or subclinical infections and is not typically an applicable measure for those with asymptomatic infections.

Our model assumes a constant risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan from 1 December 2019 to 30 January 2020, based on the date of symptom onset of the first known case and the last known possible exposure within Wuhan in our data set. This is a simplification of infection risk, given that the outbreak has shifted from a likely common-source outbreak associated with a seafood market to human-to-human transmission. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes suggests that the virus may have been circulating before December 2019 (19). To test the sensitivity of our estimates to that assumption, we performed an analysis where cases with unknown lower bounds on exposure were set to 1 December 2018, a full year earlier than in our primary analysis. Changing this assumption had little effect on the estimates of the median (0.2 day longer than for the overall estimate) and the 97.5th quantile (0.1 day longer) of the incubation period. In data sets such as ours, where we have adequate observations with well-defined minimum and maximum possible incubation periods for many cases, extending the universal lower bound has little bearing on the overall estimates.

This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Assuming infection occurs at the initiation of monitoring, our estimates suggest that 101 out of every 10 000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this rate is acceptable depends on the expected risk for infection in the population being monitored and considered judgment about the cost of missing cases (14). Combining these judgments with the estimates presented here can help public health officials to set rational and evidence-based COVID-19 control policies.",

Let's put it bluntly: Stay The Fuck Home!

The Self-Quarantine Manifesto

With no well-studied treatment and no viable vaccine available for at least another year, the only effective way to keep the coronavirus pandemic at bay is to give the virus fewer chances of spreading. The following list of actions, ordered from easiest to implement to most effective in the fight against the pandemic, should serve as a set of loose guidelines for people who wish to join the movement and take action that can actually make a difference.

Don't panic, but be alert. Wash your hands often and practice good cough and sneeze etiquette. Try to touch your face as little as possible, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Practice social distancing, no hugs and kisses, no handshakes, no high fives. If you must, use safer alternatives. Do not attend concerts, stage plays, sporting events, or any other mass entertainment events. Refrain from visiting museums, exhibitions, movie theaters, night clubs, and other entertainment venues. Stay away from social gatherings and events, like club meetings, religious services, and private parties. Reduce travel to a minimum. Don't travel long distances if not absolutely necessary. Do not use public transportation if not absolutely necessary. If you can work from home, work from home. Urge your employer to allow remote work if needed. Replace as many social interactions as possible with remote alternatives like phone calls or video chat. Do not leave your home unless absolutely necessary.

Please keep in mind there is no right or wrong amount of actions to take. Only take the actions that you feel comfortable with and that do not endanger your livelihood. Do not quit your job over this! However, keep in mind that every action helps.

Why it's so Important

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious and potentially deadly virus that causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19. You might know it under one of its many other names, including 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Wuhan coronavirus, China or Wuhan flu, or just simply coronavirus. All of these refer to the same virus that this movement is trying to stop.

Over the past months and weeks, the virus and corresponding disease have been compared over and over to the influenza virus and the seasonal flu. Due to the overlap in symptoms and seemingly similar severity, this comparison comes naturally to a lot of people, however, looking at what we know so far about this new virus, the threat it poses to society is not easily brushed aside.

More Contagious Than the Flu With an estimated R0 (the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection) between 1.4 – 6.49 and a mean estimate of 3.28[1], SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious and spreads much faster than the seasonal flu, which has a median R0 of 1.28[2]. More Deadly Than the Flu The so-called case fatality rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be at around 2%[3], meaning that an estimated 2% of people getting diagnosed with COVID-19 will succumb to it. In comparison, the CFR of seasonal influenza is estimated to be around 0.1%[4], which means SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be about 20 times more deadly than the seasonal flu. Possibility of Severe Symptoms An estimated 15 – 20% of infected individuals suffer from severe symptoms that require medical attention[5], including pneumonia with shortness of breath and lowered blood oxygen saturation. No Treatment, No Vaccine, No Immunity As SARS-CoV-2 has only recently emerged, there is no well-studied treatment for COVID-19 and more research is needed in order to treat infected people efficiently. Likewise, there is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 yet[6] and the development of such a vaccine will take a significant amount of time. With no vaccines and no prior wide-spread immunity, everyone is a susceptible target for infection. While most infected people will only suffer from mild symptoms, this lack of herd-immunity can lead to severe illness in a significant number of at-risk individuals. Exponential Growth Due to the lack of immunity to this new virus, the entire human population is the upper limit of possible infections. And although exponential growth always seems slow at first, it can lead to unfathomably high numbers in a rather short time. With the number of infected people currently doubling in a matter of days[7], our medical systems will potentially be overloaded, which will lead to higher numbers of fatalities due to people not receiving the care they need.

By joining the movement and therefore limiting possibilities for new infections, you are not only protecting yourself, but you are also helping contain and limit the spread for everyone else, especially those who are at higher risk to suffer severe consequences from this virus.

https://truepundit.com/cover-up-fauci-approved-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine-15-years-ago-to-treat-nobody-needed-to-die/,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak – caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV – the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.

The Virology Journal – the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health – published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading – get ready for this – “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report…that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”

Dr. Anthony FauciThis means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”

Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.

He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”

The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.

But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.

Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.

On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.

“Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”

Said Dr. Zelenko:

“If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.

All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.”

The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.

While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”

So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died. READ MORE:

Study enrolling Seattle-based healthy adult volunteers.

NIH

A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID’s Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium. The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.

The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.

The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”

Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of March 15, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.

Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.

The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort. The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.

Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits between vaccinations and for additional visits across the span of a year after the second shot. Clinicians will monitor participants for common vaccination symptoms, such as soreness at the injection site or fever as well as any other medical issues. A protocol team will meet regularly to review safety data, and a safety monitoring committee will also periodically review trial data and advise NIAID. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points, which investigators will test in the laboratory to detect and measure the immune response to the experimental vaccine.

“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus,” Dr. Jackson said. “We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007.”

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCEP.120.008662#.XrG-i8LBjDA.twitter,"In the largest reported cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin, no instances of Torsade de pointes, or arrhythmogenic death were reported. Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy. Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.

Two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine, and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was not observed in the entire population. Baseline corrected QT interval intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) versus those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; 440.6±24.9 versus 439.9±24.7 ms, P =0.834). The maximum corrected QT interval during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group versus the monotherapy group (470.4±45.0 ms versus 453.3±37.0 ms, P =0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to corrected QT interval prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported.

Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin from March 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in Torsade de pointes. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation, and arrhythmogenic death.

The novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death.

What Is Known? The antimalaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and the commonly used macrolide antibiotic azithromycin are all known to increase the corrected QT interval.

A corrected QT interval >500 ms increases the risk of torsade de pointes by 2- to 3-fold. Other risk factors include drug interactions affecting drug serum levels, concomitant use of QT prolonging agents, female gender, structural heart disease, genetic polymorphisms, electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia, and hepatic disease. What the Study Adds? In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a significantly greater increase in the corrected QT interval when compared with monotherapy with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

Although patients experienced corrected QT interval prolongation, especially when combination therapy was used, the risk of arrhythmic death and torsade de pointes were not increased.

Though the efficacy of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unproven, the arrhythmic risk appears to be low and may not warrant monitoring in most hospitalized patients.

Introduction

In December of 2019, reports of an unknown pneumonia not responsive to traditional treatments emerged in Wuhan, China. The pathogen, which came to be identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel coronavirus that is now known to be responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. Since then, the virus has spread internationally infecting ≈1 million individuals and resulting in >50 000 deaths. COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 20201. Although strong data supporting any specific therapy has been lacking, several pharmacological intervention strategies have been proposed for the management of COVID-19 in hopes of decreasing morbidity and mortality related to the illness. One such therapy currently under study in humans is the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine, a medication commonly used to treat malaria, has been shown to inhibit viral infection by changing the endosomal pH that is required for viral-cell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV.2 Compared with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine has been shown in vitro to have higher inhibition against SARS-CoV-2.3 These limited studies have resulted in a surge in the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin in patients requiring inpatient care for COVID-19. Although many are hopeful that these inexpensive and readily available medications may be the key to decreasing mortality in this pandemic, as of the writing of this article, no such data exists. A notable concern is the association of QT prolongation and Torsade de pointes (TdP) with these medications when individually prescribed, and the increased risk when they are administered together, especially in patients with hepatic disease or renal failure. To evaluate the arrhythmic safety of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin, we conducted this prospective evaluation in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Methods

To minimize the possibility of unintentionally sharing information that can be used to reidentify private information, a subset of the data generated, and the analytical methods used for this study are available from the corresponding author to other researchers upon reasonable request. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Northwell Health, which waived the requirement for individual informed consent.

From the start of the outbreak until April 4, 2020, 3180 patients have received combination hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and 1181 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone for the treatment of COVID-19 in 14 hospitals of the New York State Northwell Health system. The present study is an in-depth prospective, observational study from 3 of the hospitals. All hospitalized patients >18 years of age with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 illness treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin were identified from March 1 to March 23. The decision to treat with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin was based on the clinical decision of the admitting physician and predescribed healthcare system guidelines. Healthcare system criteria for the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin therapy placed on March 1 were as follows: confirmed Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction testing or high suspicion of Covid-19 with test pending; acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe illness characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria; or clinician’s judgment that the patient is likely to progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe illness in the next 6 hours. Patients not meeting the criteria for therapy were excluded from the study. Patients chronically on hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, those with a documented hypersensitivity to any of the agents, and any patient that refused the therapies were excluded from the study.

Demographics, inpatient medication lists, values from the baseline ECGs including QRS duration, QRS morphology, and QT interval duration were collected on all patients before initiation of therapy. Inpatient medication orders were reviewed daily and any concomitant QT-prolonging agent usage was identified. Twice daily ECGs, except for patients that received a Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT) Patch (BioTelemetry, Malvern, PA), were obtained to assess the corrected QT interval (QTc). Given the large number of COVID-19 patients admitted throughout the health system and the limited amount of telemetry beds available, the MCOT patches were used to monitor for both QT prolongation and for arrhythmias in patients on nontelemetry units. MCOT patches were preprogrammed to transmit twice daily telemetry strips for QT interval measurements. Telemetry or MCOT Patch urgent alerts were reviewed for all patients and any cardiac arrhythmias were documented. Premature discontinuation of any of the medications due to QT prolongation was also noted. All QT intervals obtained from an ECG or MCOT patch were manually measured by a physician on the research team. Lead II was utilized for the measurement of the QT interval on ECG. If the T-wave could not easily be measured in lead II, leads V6, or I were alternatively used. The end of the T-wave was defined as the tangent drawn from the steepest last limb of the T-wave to its intersection with the baseline. If a baseline BBB was present, the J-T interval was measured and 120 ms was added to obtain the QT interval duration. Bazett formula was used to calculate the corrected QT interval. Baseline QT interval measurements obtained from the MCOT patch were compared with that of the baseline ECG utilizing lead I, as the MCOT patch provides a lead I strip, to ensure accuracy. Serial ECGs were not obtained on MCOT patients to decrease staff exposure. Given the observational nature of the study, members of the research team measuring the QT interval were not blinded to the patient information or course. All telemetry, ECG, and MCOT patch monitoring findings, and QT interval measurements were adjudicated by a senior board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist and a cardiac electrophysiology fellow board-certified in cardiovascular disease.

Outcome Measures

The primary clinical outcome of the study was QT prolongation resulting in TdP. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation and QT prolongation that resulted in the need to prematurely terminate chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or azithromycin as well as arrhythmogenic death.

Statistical Analysis

As this was a prospective, observational study without a specific control population, only a basic statistical analysis was utilized. Continuous variables were reported as the mean±SD and categorical variables were reported as numerical values and percentages. The Welch t test was used to compare ECG changes during treatment with the patients’ baseline ECGs. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to test the impact of monotherapy versus combination therapy, and gender along with the interaction between the 2 on the outcome of change in QTc. Fisher exact test was used to compare the number of patients with a QTc >500 ms in the monotherapy versus combination groups. The SAS Version 9.4 (Cary, NC) statistical software was used for the analysis.

Results

Between March 1st and March 23, there were 201 patients that were treated for COVID-19 with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at 3 hospitals in the Northwell Health system. A minority of these patients (10, 5.0%) received chloroquine. Of the 201 patients on either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The treatment regimens for these medications were as follows: chloroquine 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 1 day followed by 500 mg by mouth once daily for 4 days, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 1 day followed by 200 mg by mouth twice daily for 4 days, and azithromycin 500 mg by mouth or intravenous daily for 5 days. The average age of the cohort was 58.5±9.1 and 115 (57.2%) were male patients. Complete demographics are displayed in Table 1, and details regarding inpatient medication usage are outlined in Table 2.

A baseline ECG was performed before initiating therapy for COVID-19 for all patients. A majority of patients were in sinus rhythm (177, 88.1%) with baseline heart rate of 80.5±17.7 beats per minute. The mean QRS duration for the population at baseline was 92.8±19.0 ms with 46 patients (22.9%) having an intraventricular conduction delay, incomplete, or complete right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, or a ventricular paced rhythm.

Serial ECGs were used to monitor QTc intervals for 84 patients, and 117 patients (58.2%) were monitored with an MCOT patch. The baseline QTc for the entire cohort was 439.5±24.8 ms and 8 patients (4.0%) had a baseline QTc >500 ms. The average maximum QTc during treatment for the entire cohort was 463.3±42.6 ms and the post-treatment QTc was 454.8±40.1 ms. The average increase in the QTc after the 5-day course treatment was 19.33±42.1 ms (Table 3).

The baseline QTc intervals for the monotherapy group were 438.9±25.0 ms and for the combination therapy group was 439.9±24.7 ms (P=0.79). The maximum QTc during treatment was significantly shorter in patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine monotherapy when compared with patients treated with a combination of either of these medications and azithromycin (453.3±37.0 versus 470.4±45.0 ms, P=0.004; Table 4). Additionally, there were no statistically significant effects of gender (P=0.091) or an interaction between the effects of gender and medications on the difference between the Maximum QTc and the baseline QTc (P=0.93). The overall trajectory of QTc change is represented in Figure 1. The number of patients with a peak QTc >500 ms was 7 (8.6%) in the monotherapy group versus 11 (9.2%) in the combination therapy group (P=1.00) (Figure 2). Further details regarding these patients can be found in Table 5.

Figure 2. Percentage of patients with increase in corrected QT interval (QTc) for HCQ monotherapy vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy. The majority of patients in both groups had an increase in QTc of 0–20 ms. Higher percentage of patients treated with the combination therapy had an increase in QTc of 40–60 ms and >60 ms.

In addition to QT prolongation, there were 17 instances of new-onset atrial fibrillation that were discovered either on telemetry or an MCOT patch. Seven patients had monomorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and 1 patient had sustained, hemodynamically stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of likely viral myocarditis (Table 6). The primary outcome of QT prolongation leading to TdP was not observed in the entire population. Arrhythmogenic death was also not observed in the entire cohort. The secondary outcome involving the need to discontinue hydroxychloroquine due to QT prolongation occurred in 7 (3.5%) patients with average QTc of 504.4±39.5 ms. Details regarding these patients can be found in Tables 7 and 8. The trajectory of their QTc change is represented in Figure 3. A complete list of arrhythmic events and interventions is listed in Table 9. Following the development and implementation of the Northwell flow chart to minimize TdP in COVID-19 inpatients on hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, lidocaine was used to facilitate continuation of hydroxychloroquine in 2 other patients.4 The first patient’s QTc increased from baseline of 458 to 594 ms after receiving hydroxychloroquine 400 mg for 2 doses followed by 200 mg for 3 doses and 2 doses of intravenous azithromycin 500 mg. The patient was given a single dose of intravenous lidocaine 100 mg, which improved QTc to 479 ms. Azithromycin was discontinued at this time while hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily was continued for the full 5-day course. Of note, this patient was given a dose of intravenous amiodarone 150 mg 2 days before reaching the peak QTc during a rapid response for atrial fibrillation and acute hypoxic respiratory failure that required intubation. Two days after finishing the course of hydroxychloroquine, the QTc prolonged to 601 ms. Of note, the patient was receiving intravenous furosemide and pantoprazole, which may have contributed to the QTc prolongation. The patient appropriately responded to another dose of intravenous lidocaine. The subsequent QTc improved to 551 mg and normalized to <500 ms on subsequent ECGs. The second patient’s QTc increased from 456 ms to 620 ms after receiving 1 dose of hydroxychloroquine. She was given a dose of intravenous lidocaine 100 mg, which improved the QTc to 550 ms. This patient went on to complete the 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine with no further prolongation of QTc.

Discussion

The main findings of this study were (1) the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin led to a significantly greater increase in the corrected QT interval when compared to monotherapy with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, (2) prolongation of the QTc only led to premature discontinuation of these medications in 3.5% of patients, and (3) there were no instances of the primary end point of TdP in the entire cohort.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped β coronavirus that is thought to have transmitted to humans via zoonotic transfer.5,6 Virus binding and cell entry are facilitated by a type I membrane spike glycoprotein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that binds to ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)-2 receptors found in the upper and lower human respiratory tract.7,8 The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged from China in December of 2019 and has subsequently resulted in an explosion of proposed therapies for treating the virus. Among these therapies, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin are now commonly being used, following studies that showed virus-cell fusion inhibition.2,3 To date, there has been little actionable clinical data on the efficacy of using these medications in humans infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In a 2005 cohort of 23 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV, To et al9 reported a direct correlation between viral load and increasing age, suggesting an increased expression of ACE-2 receptors with age may result in higher viral loads. The relationship between viral load and disease severity, however, was not addressed. Viral load was noted to peak during the first week of illness and steadily declined over the following week.10 Subsequently, a 30-patient study in mildly symptomatic patients showed no benefit of chloroquine with regards to clearance of viral load, time to temperature normalization, and disease progression.11 Major trials evaluating clinical efficacy of this combination therapy are currently underway globally.

A major concern with the use of this therapy has been the risk of QT prolongation and TdP. TdP is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that occurs in the setting of QT prolongation that is characterized by gradual twisting and amplitude change of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric line that either spontaneously terminates or degenerates to ventricular fibrillation in about 10% of cases.12,13 Traditionally, QT-prolonging agents have been avoided in individuals with a QTc >500 ms due to a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in risk for TdP with such intervals.14–16 Most drugs cause QT prolongation by blocking the human ether-aà-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel, the voltage-gated ion channel that mediates the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, I Kr , resulting in lengthening of both ventricular repolarizations, and the duration of the ventricular action potential.17 In a similar fashion, this can result in the reactivation of calcium influx causing triggered early afterdepolarization activity. A well-timed early afterdepolarization trigger, in the presence of a prolonged QT interval, can result in TdP.18

Other risk factors for TdP include drug interactions affecting drug serum levels, concomitant use of QT-prolonging agents, female sex, structural heart disease, genetic polymorphisms, electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia, and hepatic disease. Such risk factors result in repolarization reserve reduction.18,19 Although the QTc is sensitive for predicting TdP, it is not specific. The relationship between QT prolongation and TdP is not linear as drugs that prolong the QT have not consistently been associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Incidences of sudden cardiac death occurring in the absence of QT prolongation on surface ECG have also been reported. Of all the QT prolonging drugs, antiarrhythmics have the highest risk of TdP with an incidence of 1% to 5%, whereas the risk from noncardiovascular drugs is much lower at 0.001%.13

Four hundred million courses of antimalarial drugs are annually used around the world.20 Antimalarial drugs are well known for their potential cardiac toxicity and QT prolongation effects. Of the drugs used, quinidine and halofantrine are the most likely to cause QT prolongation and TdP.21–23 Chloroquine’s reported risk of sudden cardiac death is limited to cases of hypotension due to vasodilation and negative inotropy resulting from rapid parenteral administration of the medication or situations of self-inflicted overdose.24 The risk of QT prolongation and TdP with hydroxychloroquine is limited to a series of case reports in patients with either chronic use or overdose.25–27

The reported effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on the QT interval may also be significantly affected by the course of acute malaria. Increased sympathetic tone due to fevers, anxiety, and anorexia at the onset of illness results in QT interval shortening. As patients recover with medical therapy, QT interval normalizes. QT interval normalization on day 3 of therapy, which coincides with peak drug level, may have been mistakenly attributed to the drugs.24 Furthermore, the Bazett formula, used in malaria studies, overestimates the number of patients with QT prolongation and could have contributed to the reported QT prolonging effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.28

Azithromycin, a widely utilized macrolide antibiotic, has been reported to increase QT interval and incidence of TdP.29–35 In a 2012 retrospective observational study, 5 days of therapy with azithromycin was found to have a small but statistically significant increase in cardiovascular death driven by sudden cardiac death. This effect did not persist after the treatment was stopped.36 The proarrhythmic mechanism of azithromycin is thought to be due to the drug’s ability to increase cardiac sodium current and promote intracellular sodium loading.37 However, data are lacking to show that the increased risk of death with azithromycin is a result of QT prolongation and TdT. Moreover, azithromycin and chloroquine combination therapy has been used for the protection against malaria and sexually transmitted infections in pregnant women with no reports of syncope or sudden cardiac death.38

Our study revealed that in the entire cohort treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, the increase in QTc to its peak (max QTc), and post-treatment QTc (final QTc) were statistically significant (P<0.05; Table 3). When further broken down to 2 treatment cohorts as shown in Table 4, the group treated with the combination therapy had longer Max and Final QTc intervals compared with the monotherapy group (P=0.004 and P=0.002, respectively). However, it is important to highlight that no patient had QTc prolongation that resulted in TdP. Seven patients (3.5%) needed to discontinue the medications due to QTc prolongation. Two additional patients were treated with intravenous lidocaine that shortened the QTc allowing for continuation of hydroxychloroquine. The decision to discontinue therapy was variable based on provider personal threshold and comfort. This explains why some patients with similarly prolonged QTc intervals continued therapy.

As the volume of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has increased throughout our health system, our ability to monitor every patient receiving combination therapy became limited due to the finite amount of telemetry beds available. The use of MCOT patch monitors allowed us to expand remote monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias and QT prolongation in patients not on traditional telemetry. The MCOT monitor is Food and Drug Administration–approved for the measurement, analysis, and reporting of QT intervals. The use of the monitor resulted in a reduction of exposures and personal protective equipment use by healthcare workers as the need for serial ECGs to monitor the QT interval was eliminated in this subset of patients.

Further investigation of this combination therapy is needed, especially given the lack of randomized controlled trials showing efficacy. Based on our experience, although patients experience QTc prolongation, especially when combination therapy is used, the risk of arrhythmic death or TdT were not increased. Furthermore, to date, a total of 3180 patients have received combination hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and 1181 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone for the treatment of COVID-19 in our healthcare system. There continues to be no reports of TdT in those patients. In short, the use of this combination therapy for a period of 5 days may not warrant monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias in most patients. Our Infection disease team is no longer recommending the addition of azithromycin. Coupled with the findings in this study, we have simplified our approach to monitoring patients on therapy. If the baseline QTc is ≤500 ms (550 if bundle branch block or QRS duration >120 ms) no monitoring or serial ECGs will be required. If the baseline QTc is >500 ms (550 if bundle branch block or QRS duration >120 ms) on telemetry or MCOTs, no serial ECGs will be utilized for arrhythmia and QTc monitoring. We will be performing a prospective analysis of this approach.

Limitations

The main limitation of this study is the absence of a control cohort of patients with COVID-19 infections that were not treated with any of these medications. Although this would have provided a stronger analysis, nearly every hospitalized patient with COVID-19 received ≥1 of these medications during the course of their admission during this study period. The number of patients with underlying cardiac disease in the study is small, potentially limiting generalizability to that population. The study is subject to the same limitations as other observational studies. Although baseline QT interval readings on MCOT were correlated to the baseline ECGs, subsequent QT intervals in the MCOT subset obtained while on therapy were not. This fact and the difference in filtering in MCOT patches versus traditional 12-lead ECG are a limitation. Over 4000 patients across the 17 hospitals in the Northwell Health system have received one or both therapies as of April 4, 2020 with no reported instances of TdT. This statistic, although very encouraging, may be subject to reporting bias. Lastly, our cohort of 201 patients, from the initial phases of this pandemic, represents a small fraction of the total patients we have treated. Further work is needed to confirm our findings in an even larger group of patients.

Conclusions

This is the largest reported cohort to date of patients with COVID-19 that were treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin. We observed a marked increase in the QT intervals of these patients during treatment, that was more pronounced in patients treated with combination therapy. Despite this increase, very few patients had the medications discontinued prematurely due to QT prolongation. Most importantly, there were no cases of torsade de pointes or arrhythmic death in the entire population. Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.

Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County.

Methods
On April 3-4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a sample of individuals living within the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We estimate weights to adjust our sample to match the zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity distribution within the county. We report both the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also adjust for test performance characteristics by combining data from 16 independent samples obtained from manufacturer's data, regulatory submissions, and independent evaluations: 13 samples for specificity (3,324 specimens) and 3 samples for sensitivity (157 specimens).

Results
The raw prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in our sample was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.1-2.0%). Test performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95CI 99.2-99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95CI 76.0-88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test performance characteristics was 1.2% (95CI 0.7-1.8%). After weighting for population demographics of Santa Clara County, the prevalence was 2.8% (95CI 1.3-4.7%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 54,000 (95CI 25,000 to 91,000 using weighted prevalence; 23,000 with 95CI 14,000-35,000 using unweighted prevalence) people were infected in Santa Clara County by early April, many more than the approximately 1,000 confirmed cases at the time of the survey.

Conclusions
The estimated population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection may be much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. More studies are needed to improve precision of prevalence estimates. Locally-derived population prevalence estimates should be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.

https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/news/covid-19-vaccine-candidate-shows-promise-first-peer-reviewed-research,"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine scientists announced a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. When tested in mice, the vaccine, delivered through a fingertip-sized patch, produces antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 at quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralizing the virus.

The paper appeared April 2 in eBioMedicine, which is published by The Lancet, and is the first study to be published after critique from fellow scientists at outside institutions that describes a candidate vaccine for COVID-19. The researchers were able to act quickly because they had already laid the groundwork during earlier coronavirus epidemics.

“We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus,” said co-senior author Andrea Gambotto, associate professor of surgery at the Pitt School of Medicine. “That’s why it’s important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from.”

“Our ability to rapidly develop this vaccine was a result of scientists with expertise in diverse areas of research working together with a common goal,” said co-senior author Louis Falo, professor and chair of dermatology at Pitt’s School of Medicine and UPMC.

Compared to the experimental mRNA vaccine candidate that just entered clinical trials, the vaccine described in this paper—which the authors are calling PittCoVacc, short for Pittsburgh CoronaVirus Vaccine—follows a more established approach, using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity. It’s the same way the current flu shots work.

The researchers also used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency. This array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. The patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles—which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces—simply dissolve into the skin.

“We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,” Falo said. “And it’s actually pretty painless—it feels kind of like Velcro.”

The system is also highly scalable. The protein pieces are manufactured by a “cell factory”—layers upon layers of cultured cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein—that can be stacked further to multiply yield. Purifying the protein can also be done at industrial scale. Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mold using a centrifuge. Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it’s needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.

“For most vaccines, you don’t need to address scalability to begin with,” Gambotto said. “But when you try to develop a vaccine quickly against a pandemic that’s the first requirement.”

When tested in mice, PittCoVacc generated a surge of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the microneedle prick.

Those animals haven’t been tracked long term yet, but the researchers point out that mice who got their MERS-CoV vaccine produced a sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the virus for at least a year, and so far the antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals seem to be following the same trend.

Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 microneedle vaccine maintains its potency even after being thoroughly sterilized with gamma radiation—a key step toward making a product that’s suitable for use in humans.

The authors are now in the process of applying for an investigational new drug (IND) approval from the Food and Drug Administration in anticipation of starting a phase I human clinical trial in the next few months.

“Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,” Falo said. “This particular situation is different from anything we’ve ever seen, so we don’t know how long the clinical development process will take. Recently announced revisions to the normal processes suggest we may be able to advance this faster.”

Separation If you are potentially infectious, it is important that you separate yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your elderly aunt. To be on the safe side, you shouldn’t even pet your dog, according to the C.D.C., although pets are not known to transmit the coronavirus.

A room must be designated for your exclusive use. A bathroom should be, too, if possible. Every surface you cough on or touch could become contaminated with the virus.

You should have no visitors, and keep three to six feet away from others. Don’t take the bus or subway, or even a taxi.

Masks If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (only after you have called) — you should wear a mask, and everyone else should, too.

But first, you or one of your friends or family members have to find masks, which are sold out almost everywhere. If you can’t, you can create a makeshift one from a scarf or other garment.

Hygiene If you cough or sneeze, you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, and discard the used tissue in a lined trash can. Then you must immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.","   Sections SEARCH Skip to content Skip to site index Health Today’s Paper Health | How to Quarantine Yourself https://nyti.ms/2V9Ca7o The Coronavirus Outbreak live Latest Updates Maps and Cases Reopenings and Closings Understanding Superspreaders Coronavirus Recovery Advertisement Continue reading the main story Supported by Continue reading the main story How to Quarantine Yourself Thousands who may have been exposed to the coronavirus have been asked to seclude themselves. It’s harder than it sounds.

Andrew Burton for The New York Times By  Roni Caryn Rabin April 6, 2020 Leer en español Stay home unless you must see a doctor. No trips to the office or school, no shopping. If you must come out of your room, wear a mask. And don’t share towels. If you are among the thousands of Americans now self-quarantined because of possible infection with the coronavirus, these are a few of the new house rules, courtesy of your local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Self-quarantine and self-isolation are different. The first measure is for the large numbers of healthy people who may fall sick following possible exposure. The second is for people who are ill with the coronavirus — they are a danger to their family and visitors, and must be watched carefully in case they deteriorate. At the moment, with testing still scarce in much of the country, it is hard for many Americans to know whether they are infected or just being prudent. State and local governments generally have the power not just to advise quarantine but to order it. The circumstances under which they do so may change frequently, as the perceived threats change. Countries around the world have instituted bans for travelers , many of which include requiring or requesting that travelers self-quarantine on their arrival. (In the United States, state-by-state travel is also being scrutinized.) A growing number of people are self-quarantining because they were exposed to a friend or colleague who is sick. Millions of other Americans have also been asked to stay in and venture out only for necessities in an effort to stem the disease’s spread. It may sound like a vacation from reality, an ideal time to binge on Netflix and catch up on sleep. In fact, it’s not easy to lock yourself away from family and friends. There are practical and logistical challenges, and yawning gaps in the official advice that make it even harder. Home quarantine can be unpleasant and will probably last for two weeks, which is the presumed incubation period for the virus. It is especially challenging if you have young children or elderly relatives to care for, or live in cramped quarters with a lot of roommates.

Latest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak  Updated 2020-07-03T12:25:35.081Z  As U.S. infections reach another record, leaders seek new answers and itineraries.  Pubs are reopening in Britain, and Boris Johnson is urging people not to ‘overdo it.’  Biden supporters are more worried about the health hazards of voting.

Alex Welsh for The New York Times Disinfect Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels or bedding with anyone (including your pets). Wash these items after you use them. Countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables are considered “high-touch surfaces” — wipe them often with a household cleanser. Frequently wipe down surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids, including blood and stool. Monitoring Keep an eye on your health and call a doctor if you develop symptoms or if they worsen . Make sure to tell the medical staff that you are at risk of infection with the coronavirus. [ Like the Science Times page on Facebook.  | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter. ] Household  members Housemates can go to work or school, but it’s going to be their job to stock up on groceries, pick up prescriptions, take care of the quarantined and keep the place clean. They’ll be wiping down doorknobs and countertops, doing loads of laundry and washing their hands — a lot. Family members and other occupants should monitor the patient’s symptoms and call a health provider if they see a turn for the worse. When around a symptomatic patient, household members must wear a face mask, as well as gloves if they have contact with his or her bodily fluids. These should be thrown away immediately, never reused. Elderly members of the household and those with chronic medical conditions risk severe complications, even death, if they become infected. Pregnant women may also be at particular risk, although the data aren’t clear. Contact with the secluded individual should be minimized. In China, 70 to 80 percent of transmission occurred within family clusters, according to the World Health Organization. Local governments there were forced to set up isolation wards with thousands of beds in gymnasiums and stadiums to care for people who lived alone or were at risk of infecting their families. Family members should monitor their own health, and contact a doctor if they develop a cough, fever or shortness of breath, signs of Covid-19, the technical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus. Please call first, so the office can prepare for your visit or direct you to a more appropriate site for care. Unanswered questions Not everyone can work remotely, and a two-week absence from work can take an enormous financial toll on hourly wage workers who have to clock in and show up to get paid, or who are part of the gig economy with no single employer. However, included in the new $2 trillion stimulus package is jobless aid for many of those required to quarantine. (Who qualifies, how much aid can be collected and more information about the stimulus plan can be found here .) There is no reimbursement for products you may need, no government home aide to stop by and help out. (Some states, like Washington, are attempting to provide limited assistance.) Self-quarantine is a hardship, both emotional and financial, for those who have families and those who live alone. “We have to have social interventions to incentivize and support isolation, or we are doomed,” said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center. People with no health insurance, inadequate insurance or no regular doctor will be reluctant to seek care if they have symptoms, fearing steep medical bills, he noted. Undocumented individuals, fearful of being discovered and deported, may avoid diagnosis and care. Major health insurers have said they will waive out of pocket costs for testing and treatment, according to administration officials, and Medicare and Medicaid also will cover the costs. Providing for people who make sacrifices for the greater good is crucial, said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “We ought to have a social compact: If you’re sick, whether you’ve got Covid-19 or not, you should separate yourself from society,” Mr. Gostin said. “That’s your part of the bargain, you’re doing it for your neighbors, your family and your community.” “In exchange,” he said, “we as a nation owe you the right to a humane period of separation, where we meet your essential needs like medicine, health care, food and sick pay.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Site Index Site Information Navigation © 2020  The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Subscriptions    "

https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/foreigners-in-quarantine-at-isha/article31221606.ece,"As many as 150 foreigners are currently accommodated at Isha Yoga Foundation where they had come to attend various programmes, including for Shivaratri held on February 21.

On Tuesday, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said that the government was collecting details of foreigners and Indians who had come to the State after February 15 and foreigners at Isha Yoga were also in the checklist.

According to the Coimbatore district administration, the foreigners had come much before the government notification. They are in quarantine on Isha Yoga campus and Health Department conducted a check-up. They were being monitored regularly, said district administration.

Health Department sources said that the medical examination was held on March 28. However, details of the medical examination, including type of test/screening done on foreigners were not available.",
https://www.vox.com/2020/3/12/21177182/coronavirus-covid-19-trump-exposure-quarantine,"If President Donald Trump listened to his own administration’s advice, he would self-quarantine to curb the spread of Covid-19. Instead, experts say he’s putting others and himself at risk by continuing to work normally despite having been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

A self-quarantine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is “The separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease.” It’s proven to be one of the most effective methods of stopping a larger outbreak.

The fact that Trump isn’t doing this — or that his staff isn’t making him do it — is a very serious concern. “He should be” self-quarantined says Tara Smith, an expert on infectious diseases at Kent State University.

That’s because the president may actually have been exposed to the virus: Last Saturday, Trump met with a top Brazilian official at Mar-a-Lago who has since tested positive for Covid-19.

An image posted by the official, Fabio Wajngarten, quickly circulated on social media. It showed Trump standing right next to Wajngarten and holding a “Make Brazil Great Again” hat that the official had presumably handed to him. “The direct contact with the group from Brazil is very concerning,” says Smith.

The White House, though, isn’t worried.

In a Thursday statement, press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that “Exposures from the case are being assessed” but that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who was also in the photo, “had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.”

Per the CDC definition above, though, it’s reasonable to assume Trump could have been exposed to the virus during that interaction. While Trump may not be showing symptoms, it’s not impossible to think he’s carrying the disease and risks exposing others to it.

But two senators who met with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro aren’t taking any chances.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) was in the same room as Wajngarten during a Miami meeting with Bolsonaro, and has therefore chosen to self-quarantine even though his doctor told him he was a low risk. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is following similar counsel: “In an abundance of caution and upon the advice of his doctor, Senator Graham has decided to self-quarantine awaiting the results of a coronavirus test,” reads a Thursday statement from his office.

But that’s not all.

In the last week, Trump has had direct contact with two Republican Congress members just before they self-quarantined due to their exposure to coronavirus. Those politicians, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), had been in contact with someone who tested positive during the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump also spoke at the event, but it’s unclear if he came into direct contact with the person who tested positive.

Further, Trump has been on the campaign trail where he’s been shaking hands and taking photos with supporters.

Health professionals I spoke to earlier this week said that Trump, along with the leading Democratic presidential candidates, should stop doing that to minimize the candidates’ risk of exposure to the virus. “That’s really hard because that contact is fundamental for interacting with potential voters,” Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told me.

It’s especially important for Trump because he’s in his 70s. The CDC notes that older adults are “at higher risk of getting very sick” from Covid-19 than the general population is. As such, the CDC advises that older people should “stay at home as much as possible” to avoid contracting the virus.

Other than a few canceled rallies, though, Trump has given no indication he plans to lie low for a while for his own safety and the safety of others. He may not want to do so because it could make him look weak or because it could make some in the country panic, both reasonable concerns during a crisis.

But the advice from medical professionals is pretty clear: Trump should probably self-quarantine to see if he shows signs of symptoms. Hopefully, he doesn’t and can continue being president as normal. If he does self-quarantine, though, he will have not only curbed a greater outbreak but set a good example for everyone else.

“This is a chance for him to show leadership and set an example for the rest of the country to follow, especially for those who have listened to him previously use the word ‘hoax’ in reference to coronavirus,” Kent State’s Smith told me.

That, in the time of the coronavirus, could potentially be a life-saving act.","         Skip to main content     Cookie banner  We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audiences come from.

https://theweek.com/articles/921833/world-putting-america-quarantine,"The United States is in the midst of a full-blown second wave of coronavirus. According to Worldometers, Tuesday had 36,015 new cases — the highest number since May 1, and the third-highest ever. Arizona, Florida, South Carolina, California, and Texas are headed for a dire emergency fast. So far deaths have thankfully not returned to their previous highs, probably in part because the new surge appears to be hitting younger patients. But deaths are also a lagging indicator, and they are highly likely to start increasing soon.

Europe, where most countries have largely contained the virus (after initial screw-ups), is looking at America with slackjawed horror. The European Union is likely to close its borders to American travelers when it restores some international travel on July 1. Canada will most likely keep its U.S. border mostly closed when the current agreement expires on July 21.

Around the world, it is beginning to sink in how profoundly rotten the United States is. Unless America manages to turn things around, it will slide from the center of the international order to a peripheral, mistrusted basketcase, and it will deserve it.

It is plainly obvious why the U.S. is experiencing a second wave. The point of coronavirus lockdowns, as I and dozens of others explained months ago, was to buy time for the government to set up more fine-grained containment protocols that could contain the virus more effectively. With transmission reduced to a manageable rate and a test-trace-isolate system in place, countries can return to something like normal life, and an increasing number are doing so. It's a tricky business and renewed lockdowns may be necessary, as fresh outbreaks in China and elsewhere have shown, but it can be done.

But the Trump administration did not even try this on a national level, or do anything of significance. Indeed, American politics is so broken that we couldn't even manage the simplest common-sense containment strategy of mandating universal mask-wearing in any indoor space. American public health experts spent weeks on a bizarre and scientifically illiterate crusade against masks — a study years ago found that even cheap homemade masks significantly reduce droplet-based infection — but even after plenty of new evidence has come in, Trump and most Republicans keep insisting a mask is a matter of personal choice. Instead masks got sucked into the conservative grievance industrial complex, becoming another postmodern cultural signifier for right-wingers trying to own the libs.

Trump simply cannot grasp what the pandemic is, because in his mind nobody save himself is a real person. Appearances are all that matter — he is plainly most upset about the Bad Numbers of infections and deaths, and continues to suggest in public that the U.S. should be testing less so he looks less bad. He promises there will be no more lockdowns even as cases spike, and recently held a huge indoor rally in Tulsa — perhaps the worst possible thing he could do, especially because his followers mostly refused to wear the free provided masks. Despite being poorly attended, that rally still could easily turn out to be a mega-spreader event.

It is no doubt extremely alarming for people around the world coming to really grasp the fact that the world's most powerful country is being run by an incompetent buffoon who could not be trusted with a lemonade stand yet still commands the lockstep loyalty of one of two major political parties. ""I can't imagine what it must be like having to go to work knowing it's unsafe,"" Siouxsie Wiles, a New Zealand disease scientist, told The Washington Post. ""There are just going to be more and more people infected, and more and more deaths. It's heartbreaking."" Indeed, American political reporters have struggled to grasp the reality of Trump as well, though the ongoing catastrophe seems to have finally beaten it into their heads.

But Trump is not the only problem with the United States. New York had the worst outbreak in the country (so far) because Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dawdled and procrastinated in its early stages. In this they exemplified perhaps the signature characteristic of American politicians: blame avoidance. When faced with a problem, most top politicians in both parties think first about how they can shift blame to others or appear the victim of circumstance. Halting the epidemic in its early stages would have required a lot of aggressive action before the need for it was clear — in a word, leadership. Politicians would have had to exercise power in a way that upset people, and carefully communicate why they were doing so. Instead they largely let events do their work for them — once outbreaks were underway and sports seasons were being canceled, they could impose lockdowns without risking a backlash. That cowardice killed tens of thousands of people. Only a handful of state governors, like Washington's Jay Inslee, actually listened to their scientists and got out ahead of events.

Now multiple states are in the throes of accelerating outbreaks, and once again politicians are following events rather than anticipating them. Back in late May many experts warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that he was reopening the state too quickly, but under criticism from those who didn't like lockdowns, he pushed forward. He largely left things up to county officials, many of whom are conservative goofballs who refuse to obey his authority. Now that reopening has plainly backfired — the state shattered its daily case record on both Monday and Tuesday — Newsom has belatedly threatened that counties that refuse to follow pandemic control guidelines may lose state aid. It's a month late and a billion dollars short.

In Texas, Governor Greg Abbot has twisted himself in knots trying to avoid any kind of responsibility. He quickly rescinded his own order closing businesses when conservatives got mad, and refused to allow local cities to implement mandatory mask orders. Instead, he left a loophole allowing them to mandate businesses to require masks, but told nobody about it until a local judge actually tried it. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, meanwhile, is weeks behind the times. At time of writing he has merely promised he will actually enforce pandemic rules on bars and restaurants, and still has not mandated mask-wearing in public. Arizona is also way behind the curve.

Now, as Adam Tooze writes in Foreign Policy, the Federal Reserve is still at the center of the world financial system, and it is still functioning. Indeed, it has rescued much of the world from multiple currency crises, as it did in 2008. Though ordinary citizens in both America and elsewhere did not get the same kid-glove treatment, at least we have not seen a chaotic collapse of the financial system — which nobody else could have prevented. For the moment there is simply no one else to fill the shoes of the United States.

But countries around the world are no doubt grappling with some unpleasant truths. A nation that could elect Donald Trump is deeply, deeply sick. We are comparatively lucky that Trump appointed Jerome Powell chair of the Federal Reserve board (who turned out to be at least in possession of his faculties), instead of, say, Jared Kushner. When a country is as gangrenous as the United States, the rot tends to spread through its entire system sooner or later. So long as the Republican Party is not comprehensively defeated politically, and the Democrats do their utmost to avoid governing, it would be extremely foolish to rely in any way on American institutions. In years to come, our fellow democratic nations may start a containment strategy against the festering American polity so as to prevent its dysfunction from spilling over its borders, as they are now doing to stop the spread of coronavirus. If they have any sense, they're already thinking about it.

https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/9378674/blackpink-quarantine-playlist,"It’s been a while since the world has heard new music from BLACKPINK, but even amid the global coronavirus pandemic, the K-pop quartet are keeping busy.

Not only are they going to be in Lady Gaga’s area later this month with a feature on her Chromatica album, but the members have also been seen back in the studio working on their own new music.

The group also released the live album from the Tokyo Dome performance of their 2019-2020 In Your Area world tour on Thursday (May 14), for those looking to relive that experience ahead of the upcoming releases.

Though South Korea isn’t shut down with stay-at-home orders, life is still in all sorts of tumultuous states for the music industry in Seoul, with stars unable to interact directly with audiences. Like many around the world, BLACKPINK’s members have sought solace in music, both classic longtime faves and newer releases.

Below, here are the songs the members of BLACKPINK are turning to for comfort during the global coronavirus pandemic.

Lady Gaga - “Always Remember Us This Way”

""I enjoy listening to this song because I was so touched by the film [A Star is Born]."" -- Jisoo

H.E.R. - “Best Part” Feat. Daniel Caesar

""I like to listen to this song when I need to feel relaxed."" -- Jisoo

Chet Baker - “I Fall in Love Too Easily”

""I listen to this song on [vinyl]. I love the emotion of this song, and it makes me want to find and watch classic films."" -- Jennie

Uncle Lucius - “Somewhere Else”

""This song makes me want to go travel."" -- Jennie

Sister Nancy - “Bam Bam”

""This is my favorite song to start up my day. I hope it brightens up yours."" -- Rosé

Wallows - “Pleaser”

""My new shower song. Best way to start the day."" -- Rosé

Troye Sivan - “Take Yourself Home” and Kiana Lede - “Second Chances” feat 6Lack

""These songs make me feel calm and relaxed -- I like to listen to these when I’m at home."" -- Lisa",

Late last month, three Republican congressmen had close contact with a confirmed carrier of the novel coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Two of those lawmakers — Matt Gaetz and Doug Collins — subsequently met with president Donald Trump.

On Monday, Gaetz and Collins announced that they would be entering self-quarantine as a result of their exposure. Trump did not.

Days later, a top aide to Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for the coronavirus. During Bolsonaro’s visit to Florida last week, that aide had met with Trump and Republican senator Rick Scott, among other U.S. officials. In light of his exposure to an infected individual, Scott decided to quarantine himself. Trump not only declined to take that measure, but told reporters that he had “no plans” to so much as take a test for the virus.

On Friday morning, Brazilian newspapers reported that Bolsonaro himself had tested positive for coronavirus. The leader’s son confirmed those reports in an interview with Fox News. Hours later, though, Bolsonaro announced that he had tested negative and his son changed his story. Notably, Trump had even closer contact with his Brazilian counterpart than he did with Bolsonaro’s aide.

Regardless of Bolsonaro’s status, his aide Fabio Wajngarten’s diagnosis is beyond dispute. And on Friday, Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who met with Wajngarten last weekend, tested positive for coronavirus.

And yet, as of this writing, Trump has not announced plans to quarantine himself. Instead, he ostensibly intends to carry on with his normal duties, which include making regular, in-person contact with the Republican Party’s congressional leadership and the highest ranking officials in his own cabinet — a great many of whom are over 65, and thus, face a substantial risk of death if they become infected with the virus.

At a Rose Garden press conference Friday afternoon, Trump was asked multiple times why he had declined to get tested for Covid-19, despite his exposure to a confirmed carrier of the virus. The president first explained that he did not need to get tested because he did not even remember meeting Wajngarten. Minutes later, when he was asked whether it was selfish of him to forgo testing – given that his administration had advised ordinary Americans who had been similarly exposed to do so – Trump said that he actually would be getting tested, but that they still needed to put together the schedule.

Until then, the president is apparently trying to shake hands with as many people as possible.

Even if the president feels no obligation to model socially responsible behavior to his fellow Americans (who are currently being asked to quarantine themselves if they’ve had direct contact with a confirmed carrier of the virus), one would think that he’d at least like to avoid potentially poisoning his entire administration.

But Trump’s sphere of concern apparently does not extend beyond the bounds of his own body.

https://smash.gg/tournament/the-quarantine-series/details,"Can me and my quarantine pal participate with the same switch?

It is certainly possible for two people to register and participate on the tourney with a single console, however, we cannot guarantee that both will have matches at alternating times. Due to the large amount of players odds are said contestants might have matches at the same time meaning one would have to be DQ'd in order to have the other make it to theirs.

Is there any chance we can reschedule our match?

Yes, as with our last tournament we will be accepting requests to transfer times after the schedule is released. Make sure to check our discord servers in order to find the form necessary to do so at a later date.

I signed up but it turns out i won't be able to make it after all, how do i quit the tournament?

Sadly Smash.gg does not permit contestants to quit the tournament by themselves so we instead ask you to contact a TO or Admin in our discord server with your Smash.gg name and we will remove you as soon as possible.

Plague

Smallpox

Yellow fever

Viral hemorrhagic fevers

Severe acute respiratory syndromes

Flu that can cause a pandemic Federal isolation and quarantine are authorized by Executive Order of the President. The President can revise this list by Executive Order.

Isolation and Quarantine

Isolation and quarantine help protect the public by preventing exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease.

Isolation separates sick people with a quarantinable communicable disease from people who are not sick.

separates sick people with a quarantinable communicable disease from people who are not sick. Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.

In addition to serving as medical functions, isolation and quarantine also are “police power” functions, derived from the right of the state to take action affecting individuals for the benefit of society.

Federal Law

The federal government derives its authority for isolation and quarantine from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S. Code § 264), the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States and between states.

The authority for carrying out these functions on a daily basis has been delegated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

CDC’s Role

Under 42 Code of Federal Regulations parts 70 and 71, CDC is authorized to detain, medically examine, and release persons arriving into the United States and traveling between states who are suspected of carrying these communicable diseases.

As part of its federal authority, CDC routinely monitors persons arriving at U.S. land border crossings and passengers and crew arriving at U.S. ports of entry for signs or symptoms of communicable diseases.

When alerted about an ill passenger or crew member by the pilot of a plane or captain of a ship, CDC may detain passengers and crew as necessary to investigate whether the cause of the illness on board is a communicable disease.

State, Local, and Tribal Law

States have police power functions to protect the health, safety, and welfare of persons within their borders. To control the spread of disease within their borders, states have laws to enforce the use of isolation and quarantine.

These laws can vary from state to state and can be specific or broad. In some states, local health authorities implement state law. In most states, breaking a quarantine order is a criminal misdemeanor.

Tribes also have police power authority to take actions that promote the health, safety, and welfare of their own tribal members. Tribal health authorities may enforce their own isolation and quarantine laws within tribal lands, if such laws exist.

Who Is in Charge

The federal government

Acts to prevent the entry of communicable diseases into the United States. Quarantine and isolation may be used at U.S. ports of entry.

Is authorized to take measures to prevent the spread of communicable diseases between states.

May accept state and local assistance in enforcing federal quarantine.

May assist state and local authorities in preventing the spread of communicable diseases.

State, local, and tribal authorities

Enforce isolation and quarantine within their borders.

It is possible for federal, state, local, and tribal health authorities to have and use all at the same time separate but coexisting legal quarantine power in certain events. In the event of a conflict, federal law is supreme.

Enforcement

If a quarantinable disease is suspected or identified, CDC may issue a federal isolation or quarantine order.

Public health authorities at the federal, state, local, and tribal levels may sometimes seek help from police or other law enforcement officers to enforce a public health order.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Coast Guard officers are authorized to help enforce federal quarantine orders.

Breaking a federal quarantine order is punishable by fines and imprisonment.

Federal law allows the conditional release of persons from quarantine if they comply with medical monitoring and surveillance.

In the rare event that a federal order is issued by CDC, those individuals will be provided with an order for quarantine or isolation. An example of a Quarantine Order for Novel Coronavirus (print-only) pdf icon[PDF – 5 pages] is provided. This document outlines the rationale of the federal order as well as information on where the individual will be located, quarantine requirements including the length of the order, CDC’s legal authority, and information outlining what the individual can expect while under federal order.

Federal Quarantine Rarely used

Large-scale isolation and quarantine was last enforced during the influenza (“Spanish Flu”) pandemic in 1918–1919. In recent history, only a few public health events have prompted federal isolation or quarantine orders.

https://www.turnto23.com/news/coronavirus/accelerated-urgent-care-doctors-recommend-lifting-shelter-in-place-order,"BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Doctors and co-owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield say it may not be necessary anymore for residents to shelter-in-place.

Doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi said their facilities have tested over 5,200 patients for the coronavirus throughout the county, making up for over half of all testing in Kern. According to their data, the death rate of the coronavirus is similar in prevalence to the flu.

""Now that we have the facts,"" said Dr. Erickson. ""It's time to get back to work.""

Erickson said he believes businesses could reopen and as testing continues, people could starting going back to work. In fact, Erickson suggests that staying at home too long could be even worse for people's health.



""we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems,"" Erickson said. ""I don't want to stay in my home and develop a weak immune system and then come out and get a disease.""

https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/Bay-Area-must-shelter-in-place-Only-15135014.php,"Six Bay Area counties announced “shelter in place” orders for all residents on Monday — the strictest measure of its kind yet in the continental United States — directing everyone to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks in a desperate move to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus across the region.

The directive was set to begin at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and involves San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa and Alameda counties — a combined population of more than 6.7 million. It is to stay in place until at least April 7. The three other Bay Area counties — Sonoma, Solano and Napa — did not issue similar mandates.

Just outside the Bay Area, Santa Cruz County late Monday also announced a “shelter in place” order for its 275,000 residents.

The orders — which are all similarly worded — fall just short of a full lockdown, which would forbid people from leaving their homes without explicit permission. The orders (read San Francisco’s here in its entirety at tinyurl.com/waddyqv) call for county and city sheriffs and police chiefs to “ensure compliance,” and local authorities said they would not “rush to enforce” the directives as residents adjusted to understand what activities are no longer allowed. Violation of the orders is considered a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or jail time.

Businesses that do not provide “essential” services must send workers home. Among those remaining open are grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants for delivery only and hardware stores. Most workers are ordered to stay home, with exceptions including health care workers; police, fire and other emergency responders; and utility providers such as electricians, plumbers and sanitation workers. BART will run for essential travel, and airports are not closing.

“We were seeing a tipping point here in Santa Clara County with exponential growth of our cases,” said Dr. Sara Cody, health officer for the county, at a news conference Monday. The county had 138 cases as of Monday — an increase of 72 since Friday. “Over the weekend, I had a discussion with fellow health officers in the Bay Area and we realized that we are one region, and that what’s happening in Santa Clara County today will soon be happening in the adjacent jurisdictions. We decided collectively we need to take swift action as soon as possible to prevent further spread.

“These orders were crafted with great thought and with great care,” Cody said. “They were also crafted very, very quickly.”

She said residents would get more information over the coming days as to what exactly is expected of them — but the priority is to stay inside and away from others.

The directive allows for people to go outside — and in fact, health officers encouraged people to run, hike and walk their dogs, as long as they do it alone or with close family, and keep 6 feet away from others. Trails and parks are open, but people cannot gather in groups. Recreation centers and clubhouses are closed.

The region is the first to direct people to stay home as much as possible and avoid even small social interactions. On Friday, Santa Clara County had banned all gatherings of 35 people or more.

“I thought that announcement was hard, this one is exponentially harder,” Cody said.

In Washington state — where a Seattle-area outbreak has infected more than 400 and killed 37 — public health officials on Monday announced that bars, restaurants, clubs, gyms and other indoor social or recreational venues were to be closed until March 31. The state also banned all gatherings of 50 or more people. But the restrictions stopped short of advising people to shelter in place and did not ban non-essential travel.

“My fellow San Franciscans, what we are asking for everyone to do is to remain at home for all but the most essential outings for your safety and the safety of those around you,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said at a news conference Monday.

The orders come as cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, climb rapidly around the region. The Bay Area has reported nearly 300 cases since the outbreak began — but more than half of those cases were in the past four days alone. And national testing shortfalls mean that there are certainly many more hundreds and possibly thousands of cases in the region that have not been diagnosed, infectious disease experts say.

Five people have died of COVID-19 in the Bay Area, including two deaths reported in Santa Clara County on Monday.

Now Playing:

Increasingly aggressive responses — such as limiting large gatherings and closing schools — have not slowed the spread of the disease, and public health officials agreed over the weekend that much more restrictive tactics were needed to force people apart. Authorities fear that regional hospitals could be overwhelmed by a crush of seriously ill patients if the virus is allowed to keep spreading as it has been.

In the six Bay Area counties and Santa Cruz, non-essential gatherings of any size are now banned, along with non-essential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit.” People may travel for shopping for necessary supplies, accessing health care and providing aid to family and friends who need assistance, and for non-residents, returning to their homes outside the region.

Airports, taxis and public transit — including BART — will remain operational, but only for essential travel, and people are expected to keep 6 feet apart when possible. BART officials said they would ensure “long enough trains to allow for social distancing.”

Now Playing:

People in the seven counties will still be able to go shopping for items such as food and household supplies, and seek medical care. They will be able to go outside for fresh air or exercise as long as they keep away from anyone they don’t already live with.

People who are homeless are exempt from the order but encouraged to find shelter. In response to the directives, Alameda and San Francisco counties announced they were suspending all evictions.

People who are older or have underlying health problems are being told to stay inside at all times except for health care, under the new directive. They should ask someone to shop for them if they are able.

The order calls for all “routine medical appointments” and elective procedures to be canceled or rescheduled. “To the extent possible, all health care visits that are not canceled or rescheduled should be done remotely,” the order states.

In San Francisco, Police Chief Bill Scott said his department would be “looking for voluntary compliance” with the health order. Police could cite people for failing to comply with it — but Scott was clear that such a measure was an “absolute last resort.”

Grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open, and restaurants may stay open to provide takeout food only. Also staying open: veterinary services, gas stations and auto repair shops, hardware and other home supply stores, banks and laundry services. Businesses that remain open are encouraged to keep both employees and customers 6 feet apart, including while standing in line. But there are no specific limitations on the number of people allowed inside.

Daycare centers may stay open, but children must be kept in groups no larger than 12, and they must stay with the same group of children every day.

For area residents, it is just the latest in a series of steps pushing them to their homes, away from the office, large gatherings and other social activities in recent weeks. Rashid Ibarra said he’s already steeped in a social isolation mind-set, after weeks of worsening news about the virus.

“I know what it means to have the president declare a state of emergency,” Ibarra said. “I was supposed to be at work today but I called in.” His employer has given workers an advance on their sick time, he said.

At the corner of Larkin Street and Golden Gate Avenue, he said his immediate plans were “to go get some pastries and then go and kick it at the pad.”

Solano County public health officials said they did not plan to join the regional shelter-in-place orders. But they said high-risk people, including older adults, are advised to follow similar recommendations. Sonoma and Napa county officials said they were watching the situation but had no immediate plans to issue a similar order.

The announcement came just a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom advised that all bars in the state be closed, and that restaurants reduce capacity. Several states have announced closures of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, and instituted curfews. Also on Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged that all gatherings of 50 or people or more be stopped nationwide — the agency’s strongest advisory so far. As of Monday morning, confirmed U.S. COVID-19 cases had topped 4,000, but the actual number of infected people is said to be far higher.

And on Monday, President Trump advised Americans to avoid bars and restaurants, and any social gatherings of 10 or more people.

“We are in a rough place. And we are going to have difficult times ahead of us,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo County health officer, said at a Monday news conference in San Jose. “The measures that we are putting in place are temporary. But they will last longer than any of us want. This is the time to unite as a community, to come to each others’ aid and dig really deep.”

Photo: Gabrielle Lurie, The Chronicle                Six Bay Area counties announced “shelter in place” orders for all residents on Monday — the strictest measure of its kind yet in the continental United States — directing everyone to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks in a desperate move to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus across the region.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/california-stay-at-home-beach-goers/index.html,"(CNN) Crowds descended on California beaches, hiking trails and parks over the weekend in open defiance of a state order to shelter in place and avoid close contact with others.

People are seen on the beach on March 21, 2020 in Huntington Beach, California.

Instead, many public spaces were packed, prompting officials in some cities to order parks, recreation areas and beaches to close.

'People packing beaches'

Video and photos on social media showed groups of people standing in close contact of one another at popular hiking trails and beaches in Los Angeles over the weekend. Health officials urge people to maintain a distance of 6 feet from one another to prevent transmission of the highly contagious virus.

A bike path in Huntington Beach, California was packed Saturday despite a shelter in place order from the Governor.

In response to the crowds, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced on Twitter late Sunday that he was closing sports and recreation at all LA City Parks. He also tweeted that parking at city beaches was closed.

""This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks,"" the Mayor tweeted. He said people should heed the closures and stay home. ""That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives.""

This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks. So we are closing sports and recreation at @LACityParks and closing parking at city beaches. That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives. — Mayor Eric Garcetti (@MayorOfLA) March 23, 2020

Garcetti told CNN affiliate KTLA that he was working with officials in neighboring cities and the county to address large crowds at beaches.

Meanwhile, the city of Santa Monica closed its beach parking Sunday to deter people from flocking to the beach.

Further south, the city of Long Beach closed many of its recreation facilities. On Sunday night, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said in a tweet that the city had closed skate parks, dog parks, playgrounds, picnic areas as well as volleyball, tennis and basketball courts.

The city is trying to discourage people from playing team sports and encourage them to maintain a social distance of 6 feet when utilizing city facilities.

Garcia tweeted that the city is also looking to establish additional guidance for the use of its beaches.

He said the onus is on residents to comply with the rules as public safety teams may not be able to enforce the orders.

To be clear, the Governor and City's order does allow people to go for a walk or visit a park or beach. However, you must still use social distancing. You can't play team sports, and you must stay 6 feet apart from anyone else. — Mayor Robert Garcia (@LongBeachMayor) March 22, 2020

""More signs are going up at beaches and courts, and we will look to enforce more -- but our public safety teams are incredibly busy,"" Garcia tweeted. ""We need the public to take self responsibility and remember that our doctors, nurses and medical personnel are counting on us.""

California wasn't the only place where people ignored orders to stay home and maintain social distance.

Beaches closed and boating banned in Florida

This weekend several videos showed large groups of people partying on boats and tying their water crafts together in the Biscayne Bay of Miami and outside Boca Raton.

While Lake Boca Raton has always served as a social gathering spot for many boaters, and will again, now is not the time for parties and tie ups on the water. Please be patient, and do your part, so we can all get through this together.

1/4 pic.twitter.com/ubvgDn4UTl — City of Boca Raton (@CityBocaRaton) March 22, 2020

The city of Boca Raton tweeted images of crowded boat parties and discouraged residents from gathering on the water.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez closed marinas and boat ramps in the county Sunday to prevent people from going out to sea to hang out.

Tougher restrictions on boat ramps and marinas are now in place in addition to the other steps Miami-Dade is taking to combat new cases of COVID-19. As of this writing 177 cases had been confirmed in Miami-Dade County. Here is today's update: https://t.co/n1giPmYfaR — Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez (@MayorGimenez) March 22, 2020

""I am disappointed to see photos and videos on social media of boats close together and large groups of people congregating,"" Gimenez said in a news release Sunday. ""We are in a state of emergency, and I cannot stress enough the need for personal responsibility.""

Beaches throughout Florida closed for the weekend to prevent spring breakers and residents from gathering on the beach.

On Friday, several beaches in the state closed to the public and hotels in Miami-Dade County were ordered to vacate by Monday night.

The mayor said the Miami-Dade Police Department will be out on the water ""ramping up enforcement"" of the no rafting order issued by the mayor on Friday to prevent large gatherings and parties on boats.

Park closures around the country

Parks from coast to coast were closed by local authorities over the weekend in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a shelter in place order directing the state's nearly 40 million residents to stay home beginning March 20 to help stop the spread of coronavirus. People are seen on the beach on March 21, 2020 in Huntington Beach, California. Instead, many public spaces were packed, prompting officials in some cities to order parks, recreation areas and beaches to close. 'People packing beaches' Video and photos on social media showed groups of people standing in close contact of one another at popular hiking trails and beaches in Los Angeles over the weekend. Health officials urge people to maintain a distance of 6 feet from one another to prevent transmission of the highly contagious virus.  A bike path in Huntington Beach, California was packed Saturday despite a shelter in place order from the Governor. Read More In response to the crowds, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced on Twitter late Sunday that he was closing sports and recreation at all LA City Parks. He also tweeted that parking at city beaches was closed. ""This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks,"" the Mayor tweeted. He said people should heed the closures and stay home. ""That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives."" This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks. So we are closing sports and recreation at @LACityParks and closing parking at city beaches. That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives. — Mayor Eric Garcetti (@MayorOfLA) March 23, 2020  Garcetti told CNN affiliate KTLA that he was working with officials in neighboring cities and the county to address large crowds at beaches. Meanwhile, the city of Santa Monica closed its beach parking Sunday to deter people from flocking to the beach. Nearby, the city of Malibu issued additional guidance urging residents to maintain a safe distance if they were heading outside for a hike or to go to the beach. City-owned parks and trails also were closed to the public. Further south, the city of Long Beach closed many of its recreation facilities. On Sunday night, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said in a tweet that the city had closed skate parks, dog parks, playgrounds, picnic areas as well as volleyball, tennis and basketball courts. The city is trying to discourage people from playing team sports and encourage them to maintain a social distance of 6 feet when utilizing city facilities. Garcia tweeted that the city is also looking to establish additional guidance for the use of its beaches. He said the onus is on residents to comply with the rules as public safety teams may not be able to enforce the orders. To be clear, the Governor and City's order does allow people to go for a walk or visit a park or beach. However, you must still use social distancing. You can't play team sports, and you must stay 6 feet apart from anyone else. — Mayor Robert Garcia (@LongBeachMayor) March 22, 2020  ""More signs are going up at beaches and courts, and we will look to enforce more -- but our public safety teams are incredibly busy,"" Garcia tweeted. ""We need the public to take self responsibility and remember that our doctors, nurses and medical personnel are counting on us."" California wasn't the only place where people ignored orders to stay home and maintain social distance. Beaches closed and boating banned in Florida This weekend several videos showed large groups of people partying on boats and tying their water crafts together in the Biscayne Bay of Miami and outside Boca Raton. While Lake Boca Raton has always served as a social gathering spot for many boaters, and will again, now is not the time for parties and tie ups on the water. Please be patient, and do your part, so we can all get through this together. 1/4 pic.twitter.com/ubvgDn4UTl — City of Boca Raton (@CityBocaRaton) March 22, 2020  The city of Boca Raton tweeted images of crowded boat parties and discouraged residents from gathering on the water. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez closed marinas and boat ramps in the county Sunday to prevent people from going out to sea to hang out. Tougher restrictions on boat ramps and marinas are now in place in addition to the other steps Miami-Dade is taking to combat new cases of COVID-19.

https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/breaking-georgia-governor-orders-shelter-place-curb-coronavirus/vdAoWkjq39W2usr9e8W8BL/,"Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday said he is preparing a statewide shelter-in-place order across Georgia to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a turnabout after weeks of balking at taking more drastic steps to combat the pandemic.

The new rules, which he will issue Thursday, are set to run from Friday through April 13. He also said he would immediately sign an order that would close k-12 schools through the rest of the academic year.

The Republican faced mounting pressure from public health officials, local leaders and prominent politicians who warned that a failure to take more sweeping action would further strain Georgia’s health care system and lead to more deaths.

“I want to encourage my fellow Georgians to hang in there. I know you’re tired of this,” he said at a windy press conference outside the state Capitol. “But we must first overcome the obstacles in our path.”

Kemp had balked at more stringent restrictions to combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, in part because he was worried more severe bans would cripple the economy in parts of the state where there are few known cases of the illness.

But he reversed course Wednesday as a growing number of other Republican governors, including the leaders of Florida, South Carolina and Texas, instituted broader limits on mobility and shuttered more businesses to try to counter the disease.

He said his decision was triggered by ""game-changing” new projections on the disease’s spread in Georgia. He also said he was informed of new data that this virus “is now transmitting before people see signs.”

“Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt” symptoms, he said. “We didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.”

04/01/2020 - Atlanta, Georgia - Gov. Brian Kemp (center) speaks during a press conference at Liberty Plaza, across the street from the Georgia State Capitol building, in downtown Atlanta, Wednesday, April 1, 2020. During the presser, Gov. Kemp ordered all Georgia K-12 schools to be closed until the end of the academic school year. He also said he will sign an order on Thursday forcing a ""Stay-at-home"" order for all Georgians until April 13.

Health officials have long known that the virus could be transmitted this way, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently changed their guidance on this type of asymptomatic infection.

That contributed to significant changes in state projections on testing, hospital capacity and virus transmission rates that led Dr. Kathleen Toomey, the head of Georgia’s Department of Public Health, to endorse more severe restrictions.

“It’s a combination of recognizing there’s a large number of people out there who are infected, who are asymptomatic, who never would have been recognized under our old models,” she said, “but also seeing the community transmission that we’re seeing.”

‘All over the place’



Kemp said the shelter-in-place order comes with exceptions including grocery stores, medical suppliers and certain manufacturing. Kemp aides say it’s likely to allow restaurants to serve takeout but ban dine-in service.

“People have to eat. We have to continue to process our food supply. We have to have our pharmacies open, we have to have Georgia-based companies that are making (personal protective equipment for doctors, nurses and other caregivers), medical supplies,” he said. “These are hard things to figure out.”



The governor said law enforcement would actively require residents to comply with the restrictions, though he urged Georgians not to panic and make a run on stores.

“The grocers are ready for this. They’ll be ready to restock,” he said. “People don’t need to be worried about buying for two weeks or two months.”

The governor earlier shut down bars, banned many gatherings, canceled public school through late April and urged the “medically fragile” and others vulnerable to the disease to stay at home.

Gov. Brian Kemp said Wednesday that he is issuing a statewide shelter-in-place order as the state continues to battle the coronavirus.

But he expressed concern at taking more sweeping steps, such as a mandatory shelter-in-place order, in part because he worried they could cripple the economy in areas where there are no confirmed cases of the virus.

Instead, he’s given local leaders leeway to take steps on their own, and dozens of cities and counties have enacted curfews, shuttered nonessential businesses and issued shelter-in-place orders.

That’s led to a hodgepodge of uneven restrictions across the state that morph by the day, along with rising criticism from local officials that stricter uniformity is needed.

And his top aide fanned more confusion over the weekend by warning of an “overreach” by local officials.

Kemp’s announcement was preceded by sharpening criticism from local officials.

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said “cities need some consistency – because right now, we’re all over the place.” And state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, accused Kemp of taking half-measures.

“We are in a crisis, our governor is dragging his feet and playing catch-up when millions of lives are at stake,” said Williams, who revealed last week that she tested positive for COVID-19.

The new shelter-in-place rules were greeted with guarded relief by his critics.

“Better late than never,” said state Rep. Scott Holcomb, D-Atlanta. “Crises demand big and fast responses. Instead, we’ve had nothing but incrementalism. That means it’s going to take longer and longer to move past this.”

https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/pritzker-to-order-shelter-in-place-to-illinois-residents-report,"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials, joining similar dramatic efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Pritzker’s order, which takes effect Saturday at 5 p.m. and is set to expire April 7, still allows the state’s 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.

“If there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation,” Pritzker said. The Democrat said he was trying to prevent “potentially tens of thousands” of deaths but urged people not to panic.

“For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much,” he said, adding that people can continue to shop for groceries and visit pharmacies, gas stations and banks. Residents also can continue to pick up meals from restaurants and exercise outdoors, he said.

Pritzker acknowledged that the state doesn’t have the resources or “the desire” to broadly enforce the order, but he said law enforcement will take action if necessary in individual cases. The order exempts people who work in many essential industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation and food production or sales, including at grocery stores and restaurants.

The stay-at-home order will also mean schools statewide remain closed until April 8, he said.

Pritzker had previously ordered all schools statewide to shut down through the end of March and limited gatherings to 50 people to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He also closed dine-in service at bars and restaurants, but allowed businesses to continue delivery or carryout options.

The governors of California and New York have issued similar orders.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who stood by Pritzker’s side as he announced the order, said she agreed with the decision.

“Think of this as safer at home,” she said.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials.  CHICAGO - Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials, joining similar dramatic efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus .  Pritzker’s order, which takes effect Saturday at 5 p.m. and is set to expire April 7, still allows the state’s 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.    “If there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation,” Pritzker said. The Democrat said he was trying to prevent “potentially tens of thousands” of deaths but urged people not to panic. “For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much,” he said, adding that people can continue to shop for groceries and visit pharmacies, gas stations and banks. Residents also can continue to pick up meals from restaurants and exercise outdoors, he said.       Gov. Pritzker announces ‘stay at home’ order to Illinoisans amid COVID-19 pandemic  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has ordered the state's residents to remain in their homes except for essential needs, joining similar efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Pritzker acknowledged that the state doesn’t have the resources or “the desire” to broadly enforce the order, but he said law enforcement will take action if necessary in individual cases. The order exempts people who work in many essential industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation and food production or sales, including at grocery stores and restaurants.   Advertisement  The stay-at-home order will also mean schools statewide remain closed until April 8, he said. Pritzker had previously ordered all schools statewide to shut down through the end of March and limited gatherings to 50 people to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He also closed dine-in service at bars and restaurants, but allowed businesses to continue delivery or carryout options. The governors of California and New York have issued similar orders. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot , who stood by Pritzker’s side as he announced the order, said she agreed with the decision. “Think of this as safer at home,” she said.

https://abcnews.go.com/US/michigan-rally-shelter-place-order-spills-capitol-building/story?id=70432928,"Protesters, some armed, spill into Michigan Capitol building demanding end to stay-at-home order The state legislature is debating extending Michigan's state of emergency.

Hundreds of protesters entered the Michigan State Capitol building Thursday and crowded its halls and staircases demanding that the state legislature not extend Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus stay-at-home order.

Numerous protesters, some not wearing masks, got into the faces of state police officers stationed inside the building and shouted to be let into the chambers, which are closed to visitors due to health precautions.

State legislators were meeting to discuss extending Michigan's state of emergency, which was issued on March 10 and was slated to end on Thursday.

""Vote no!"" protesters shouted inside the building.

The legislature’s decision won't affect Whitmer's stay-at-home order, which was enacted on March 24 and will remain in effect until May 15. However, it could affect her emergency powers going forward.

Michigan Senator Dayna Polehanki tweeted a photo showing several men, at least one of them armed, on the balcony inside the building, and said that several of her colleagues had donned bulletproof vests.

""I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,"" she tweeted.

It is legal in Michigan to carry a firearm in public ""as long as the person is carrying the firearm with lawful intent and the firearm is not concealed,"" according to the state police.

Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, said the governor respects citizens' right to protest, but that they shouldn't be putting themselves or first responders at risk of catching the virus.

""It’s disappointing to see people congregating without masks, and without practicing social distancing. This kind of activity will put more people at risk, and it could mean that more people will die,"" she said in a statement.

As of Thursday morning, Michigan had more than 40,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,600 deaths, according to data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Whitmer has come under attack from protesters who argue that her COVID-19 precautions are too strict and are costing them their livelihoods.

On Friday, Whitmer amended her shelter-in-place order to allow people to perform certain jobs such as construction, and to go to recreational areas such as golf courses, as long as they practice strict social distancing. A Michigan judge also ruled in favor of the governor in a lawsuit against her office, determining that her shelter-in-place order didn't infringe on residents' constitutional rights.

""Governor Whitmer understands that this is a frustrating time and that many people are angry,"" Brown said in a statement. ""People want to spend time with their families, friends, and loved ones.""

Thursday's protests began earlier in the morning with the crowds, some of whom were armed with guns and rifles, piling up outside the building with homemade signs. Rally members drove their cars around the perimeter honking their horns.

Michigan State Police representative Lt. Brian Oleksy told ABC News that there were between 400 and 700 people at Thursday's rally. No summonses were issued however two people were arrested for allegedly getting into a fight between themselves, according to Olesky.

https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/1-500-tn-physicians-urge-governor-to-order-shelter-in-place,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — More than 1,500 physicians from across the state - including heads of the major medical organizations - are pleading for Gov. Bill Lee to order Tennesseans to shelter in place in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.

A letter delivered to the governor sounds the alarm about what it calls an ""escalating and destructive situation.""

In response, on Saturday, the Middle Tennessee Mayors Caucus endorsed the proposal, calling for Lee to ""consider the recommendation of the medical community to implement this directive.""

""We are at a crossroads,"" Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pulmonary specialist from Franklin, said in an exclusive interview with NewsChannel 5 Investigates.

""We are standing on the edge of the abyss. We are looking over the abyss. And what we do today will decide whether we are able to step back or to jump over.""

The letter, which has been signed by more than 1,500 Tennessee physicians, warns that ""we have little time to 'flatten the curve' on the current situation.""

""China and South Korea have made great strides by prohibiting travel and closure of non-essential industry and business. We must act with the same level of boldness,"" the letter continues

It suggests that the order to shelter in place should last for 14 days to give health officials a chance to get a handle on the coronavirus crisis.

""The state of Tennessee has a narrow window,"" Milstone said.

""That window will likely close within the next seven to 10 days - and then the spread of the virus will be so rampant that - no matter what we do - it will not prevent patients with the virus here in Tennessee dying or being critically ill from this illness.""

Among those signing the letter are leaders of the Tennessee American College of Emergency Physicians, the Tennessee American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the Tennessee Medical Association.

It comes just a day after Lee suggested mandatory lockdowns were not his style.

""We’re never going to be able to mandate people’s behavior in their homes and in their yards and in their neighborhoods,"" Lee told reporters.

""I believe to the degree that we can curb behavior and find responsible behavior taking place across our state, to the degree that we can do that without mandates, is better for everyone. So that’s going to be our approach.""

Dr. David Aronoff, a Nashville physician who is one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, told NewsChannel 5 Investigates that ""we want to be stacking as many cards in our favor as we possibly can to protect lives.""

""I think we need to be able to look back and say we did everything we could in our power to prevent it from being worse, and I think that's where we are at in asking for shelter-in-place mandate,"" Aronoff added.

WATCH OUR INTERVIEW WITH DR. ARONOFF BELOW

Milstone explained that ""sheltering in place means going only to the grocery story for essentials, going to the pharmacy for essentials, not going out to eat, not going to bars, not working out in gyms, staying home whenever possible.""

The Williamson County physician said the situation is urgent because Tennessee hospitals are not equipped for what might happen if a shelter in place order is not given.

""If we do not shelter in place, then the disease will continue to spread and then we will become more of a center for the disease,"" Milstone said.

""So what you are seeing on the coasts of the United States - California, Washington, New York, even to the south of us, say, Lousiana, New Orleans - those could become our new reality if we do not go forward with the shelter in place.""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-q1-earnings-75-billion-10000-per-second/,"Amazon recorded sales of $75.4 billion in the first three months of the year, a first-quarter record for the ecommerce giant, as many consumers stepped up their online purchases during coronavirus-fueled lockdowns.

That translates into nearly $10,000 in sales every second, according to calculations from Christopher Rossbach, portfolio manager of the J. Stern & Co. World Stars Global Equity fund.

""The numbers are frankly staggering,"" Rossbach said in a note.

Amazon's North America sales rose 29%, while AWS — the company's huge cloud-computing segment — increased 33%, the company said in an earnings release Thursday. At the same time, its costs of fulfilling all those customer orders jumped 34% as it hired thousands of new workers and increased pay. Amazon posted an operating profit of $3.9 billion for the quarter, a nearly 10% drop from this period last year.

The ""current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon's business as never before, but it's also the hardest time we've ever faced,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos said the company would spend at least $4 billion on costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak in the coming three months, outlining an increase in personal protective equipment and pay bumps for workers, more intense cleaning of warehouses, and about $300 million to develop internal coronavirus testing capabilities.

Amazon and Instacart workers walking off job amid safety concerns over coronavirus

Some Amazon workers say those measures aren't sufficient. Amazon and Whole Foods workers have called for a strike on Friday, asking for better paid leave policies, more protective equipment and a reinstatement of workers who have been fired after speaking out.

Amazon's financial success stands in stark contrast with the many brick-and-mortar stores that have been forced to shut their doors during the pandemic.

https://justthenews.com/nation/technology/elon-musk-calls-shelter-place-measures-forcibly-imprisoning-population-earnings,"Tesla's earnings call Wednesday got heated when Elon Musk described as “fascist” the social-distancing measures in effect across the country.

“This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their g*d*** freedom,” railed the CEO.

Musk also cautioned that the shelter-in-place orders in California, where Tesla has a major factory, could pose a threat to the company. The car factory, in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to close in late-March to help mitigate the spread of the virus.

“We are a little bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,” Musk said on the call. “The extension of the shelter-in-place or frankly what I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights … will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but many companies.”

He added that shelter-in-place orders are “not why people came to America or built this country.”

Tesla posted a quarterly gain of 32%, but the pandemic shutdown may require the company to cut production by more than 500,000 vehicles in 2020.","       Skip to content                      Search               Government    Politics    Accountability    Nation    World    Podcasts    Shop                   Government    White House    Local    Security    Diplomacy    Congress    Courts & Law    State Houses    Federal Agencies      Politics    All Things Trump    Cybersecurity    Education    Elections    Energy    Environment    Finance    Coronavirus    Polling    Privacy    Regulation    Transportation      Accountability    Media    Political Ethics    Waste, Fraud and Abuse    Watchdogs    Whistleblowers    Russia and Ukraine Scandals      Nation    Crime    Culture    Economy    Science    Technology    Extremism    Free Speech    Religion      World    Africa    Asia    Australia    Canada    Europe    Latin America    Mexico    Middle East      Podcasts    John Solomon Reports    The Pod's Honest Truth With David Brody    The Sharyl Attkisson Podcast      Shop       Search            Follow Us                              Breadcrumb    Home    Nation    Technology                           Elon Musk calls shelter-in-place measures 'forcibly imprisoning' the population on earnings call     The CEO repeatedly called the nation's shelter-in-place orders a violation of constitutional rights             Image      Tesla CEO Elon Musk  (Frederic Brown / Getty Images)               By Sophie Mann     Last Updated: April 30, 2020 - 3:46pm            Article  Dig In      Tesla's earnings call Wednesday got heated when Elon Musk described as “fascist” the social-distancing measures in effect across the country.  “This is not democratic, this is not freedom.

https://www.turnto23.com/news/coronavirus/accelerated-urgent-care-doctors-recommend-lifting-shelter-in-place-order,"BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Doctors and co-owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield say it may not be necessary anymore for residents to shelter-in-place.

Doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi said their facilities have tested over 5,200 patients for the coronavirus throughout the county, making up for over half of all testing in Kern. According to their data, the death rate of the coronavirus is similar in prevalence to the flu.

""Now that we have the facts,"" said Dr. Erickson. ""It's time to get back to work.""

Erickson said he believes businesses could reopen and as testing continues, people could starting going back to work. In fact, Erickson suggests that staying at home too long could be even worse for people's health.



""we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems,"" Erickson said. ""I don't want to stay in my home and develop a weak immune system and then come out and get a disease.""

https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/Bay-Area-must-shelter-in-place-Only-15135014.php,"Six Bay Area counties announced “shelter in place” orders for all residents on Monday — the strictest measure of its kind yet in the continental United States — directing everyone to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks in a desperate move to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus across the region.

The directive was set to begin at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and involves San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa and Alameda counties — a combined population of more than 6.7 million. It is to stay in place until at least April 7. The three other Bay Area counties — Sonoma, Solano and Napa — did not issue similar mandates.

Just outside the Bay Area, Santa Cruz County late Monday also announced a “shelter in place” order for its 275,000 residents.

The orders — which are all similarly worded — fall just short of a full lockdown, which would forbid people from leaving their homes without explicit permission. The orders (read San Francisco’s here in its entirety at tinyurl.com/waddyqv) call for county and city sheriffs and police chiefs to “ensure compliance,” and local authorities said they would not “rush to enforce” the directives as residents adjusted to understand what activities are no longer allowed. Violation of the orders is considered a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or jail time.

Businesses that do not provide “essential” services must send workers home. Among those remaining open are grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants for delivery only and hardware stores. Most workers are ordered to stay home, with exceptions including health care workers; police, fire and other emergency responders; and utility providers such as electricians, plumbers and sanitation workers. BART will run for essential travel, and airports are not closing.

“We were seeing a tipping point here in Santa Clara County with exponential growth of our cases,” said Dr. Sara Cody, health officer for the county, at a news conference Monday. The county had 138 cases as of Monday — an increase of 72 since Friday. “Over the weekend, I had a discussion with fellow health officers in the Bay Area and we realized that we are one region, and that what’s happening in Santa Clara County today will soon be happening in the adjacent jurisdictions. We decided collectively we need to take swift action as soon as possible to prevent further spread.

“These orders were crafted with great thought and with great care,” Cody said. “They were also crafted very, very quickly.”

She said residents would get more information over the coming days as to what exactly is expected of them — but the priority is to stay inside and away from others.

The directive allows for people to go outside — and in fact, health officers encouraged people to run, hike and walk their dogs, as long as they do it alone or with close family, and keep 6 feet away from others. Trails and parks are open, but people cannot gather in groups. Recreation centers and clubhouses are closed.

The region is the first to direct people to stay home as much as possible and avoid even small social interactions. On Friday, Santa Clara County had banned all gatherings of 35 people or more.

“I thought that announcement was hard, this one is exponentially harder,” Cody said.

In Washington state — where a Seattle-area outbreak has infected more than 400 and killed 37 — public health officials on Monday announced that bars, restaurants, clubs, gyms and other indoor social or recreational venues were to be closed until March 31. The state also banned all gatherings of 50 or more people. But the restrictions stopped short of advising people to shelter in place and did not ban non-essential travel.

“My fellow San Franciscans, what we are asking for everyone to do is to remain at home for all but the most essential outings for your safety and the safety of those around you,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said at a news conference Monday.

The orders come as cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, climb rapidly around the region. The Bay Area has reported nearly 300 cases since the outbreak began — but more than half of those cases were in the past four days alone. And national testing shortfalls mean that there are certainly many more hundreds and possibly thousands of cases in the region that have not been diagnosed, infectious disease experts say.

Five people have died of COVID-19 in the Bay Area, including two deaths reported in Santa Clara County on Monday.

Now Playing:

Increasingly aggressive responses — such as limiting large gatherings and closing schools — have not slowed the spread of the disease, and public health officials agreed over the weekend that much more restrictive tactics were needed to force people apart. Authorities fear that regional hospitals could be overwhelmed by a crush of seriously ill patients if the virus is allowed to keep spreading as it has been.

In the six Bay Area counties and Santa Cruz, non-essential gatherings of any size are now banned, along with non-essential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit.” People may travel for shopping for necessary supplies, accessing health care and providing aid to family and friends who need assistance, and for non-residents, returning to their homes outside the region.

Airports, taxis and public transit — including BART — will remain operational, but only for essential travel, and people are expected to keep 6 feet apart when possible. BART officials said they would ensure “long enough trains to allow for social distancing.”

Now Playing:

People in the seven counties will still be able to go shopping for items such as food and household supplies, and seek medical care. They will be able to go outside for fresh air or exercise as long as they keep away from anyone they don’t already live with.

People who are homeless are exempt from the order but encouraged to find shelter. In response to the directives, Alameda and San Francisco counties announced they were suspending all evictions.

People who are older or have underlying health problems are being told to stay inside at all times except for health care, under the new directive. They should ask someone to shop for them if they are able.

The order calls for all “routine medical appointments” and elective procedures to be canceled or rescheduled. “To the extent possible, all health care visits that are not canceled or rescheduled should be done remotely,” the order states.

In San Francisco, Police Chief Bill Scott said his department would be “looking for voluntary compliance” with the health order. Police could cite people for failing to comply with it — but Scott was clear that such a measure was an “absolute last resort.”

Grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open, and restaurants may stay open to provide takeout food only. Also staying open: veterinary services, gas stations and auto repair shops, hardware and other home supply stores, banks and laundry services. Businesses that remain open are encouraged to keep both employees and customers 6 feet apart, including while standing in line. But there are no specific limitations on the number of people allowed inside.

Daycare centers may stay open, but children must be kept in groups no larger than 12, and they must stay with the same group of children every day.

For area residents, it is just the latest in a series of steps pushing them to their homes, away from the office, large gatherings and other social activities in recent weeks. Rashid Ibarra said he’s already steeped in a social isolation mind-set, after weeks of worsening news about the virus.

“I know what it means to have the president declare a state of emergency,” Ibarra said. “I was supposed to be at work today but I called in.” His employer has given workers an advance on their sick time, he said.

At the corner of Larkin Street and Golden Gate Avenue, he said his immediate plans were “to go get some pastries and then go and kick it at the pad.”

Solano County public health officials said they did not plan to join the regional shelter-in-place orders. But they said high-risk people, including older adults, are advised to follow similar recommendations. Sonoma and Napa county officials said they were watching the situation but had no immediate plans to issue a similar order.

The announcement came just a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom advised that all bars in the state be closed, and that restaurants reduce capacity. Several states have announced closures of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, and instituted curfews. Also on Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged that all gatherings of 50 or people or more be stopped nationwide — the agency’s strongest advisory so far. As of Monday morning, confirmed U.S. COVID-19 cases had topped 4,000, but the actual number of infected people is said to be far higher.

And on Monday, President Trump advised Americans to avoid bars and restaurants, and any social gatherings of 10 or more people.

“We are in a rough place. And we are going to have difficult times ahead of us,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo County health officer, said at a Monday news conference in San Jose. “The measures that we are putting in place are temporary. But they will last longer than any of us want. This is the time to unite as a community, to come to each others’ aid and dig really deep.”

Photo: Gabrielle Lurie, The Chronicle                Six Bay Area counties announced “shelter in place” orders for all residents on Monday — the strictest measure of its kind yet in the continental United States — directing everyone to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks in a desperate move to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus across the region.  The directive was set to begin at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and involves San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa and Alameda counties — a combined population of more than 6.7 million. It is to stay in place until at least April 7. The three other Bay Area counties — Sonoma, Solano and Napa — did not issue similar mandates.  Just outside the Bay Area, Santa Cruz County late Monday also announced a “shelter in place” order for its 275,000 residents.   The orders — which are all similarly worded — fall just short of a full lockdown, which would forbid people from leaving their homes without explicit permission. The orders (read San Francisco’s here in its entirety at tinyurl.com/waddyqv ) call for county and city sheriffs and police chiefs to “ensure compliance,” and local authorities said they would not “rush to enforce” the directives as residents adjusted to understand what activities are no longer allowed. Violation of the orders is considered a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or jail time.   Businesses that do not provide “essential” services must send workers home. Among those remaining open are grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants for delivery only and hardware stores. Most workers are ordered to stay home, with exceptions including health care workers; police, fire and other emergency responders; and utility providers such as electricians, plumbers and sanitation workers. BART will run for essential travel, and airports are not closing.  “We were seeing a tipping point here in Santa Clara County with exponential growth of our cases,” said Dr. Sara Cody, health officer for the county, at a news conference Monday. The county had 138 cases as of Monday — an increase of 72 since Friday. “Over the weekend, I had a discussion with fellow health officers in the Bay Area and we realized that we are one region, and that what’s happening in Santa Clara County today will soon be happening in the adjacent jurisdictions. We decided collectively we need to take swift action as soon as possible to prevent further spread.  “These orders were crafted with great thought and with great care,” Cody said. “They were also crafted very, very quickly.”     Coronavirus Outbreak        Local By Dominic Fracassa and Aidin Vaziri 'Shelter in place:’ What you need to know about how life...

Local Chronicle Staff Report Coronavirus hits Bay Area: What residents need to know     She said residents would get more information over the coming days as to what exactly is expected of them — but the priority is to stay inside and away from others.  The directive allows for people to go outside — and in fact, health officers encouraged people to run, hike and walk their dogs, as long as they do it alone or with close family, and keep 6 feet away from others. Trails and parks are open, but people cannot gather in groups. Recreation centers and clubhouses are closed.   SF Shelter In Place Health Order 2020 March 16 (PDF)   SF Shelter In Place Health Order 2020 March 16 (Text)   The region is the first to direct people to stay home as much as possible and avoid even small social interactions. On Friday, Santa Clara County had banned all gatherings of 35 people or more.  “I thought that announcement was hard, this one is exponentially harder,” Cody said.  In Washington state — where a Seattle-area outbreak has infected more than 400 and killed 37 — public health officials on Monday announced that bars, restaurants, clubs, gyms and other indoor social or recreational venues were to be closed until March 31. The state also banned all gatherings of 50 or more people. But the restrictions stopped short of advising people to shelter in place and did not ban non-essential travel.   “My fellow San Franciscans, what we are asking for everyone to do is to remain at home for all but the most essential outings for your safety and the safety of those around you,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said at a news conference Monday.  The orders come as cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, climb rapidly around the region. The Bay Area has reported nearly 300 cases since the outbreak began — but more than half of those cases were in the past four days alone. And national testing shortfalls mean that there are certainly many more hundreds and possibly thousands of cases in the region that have not been diagnosed, infectious disease experts say.  Five people have died of COVID-19 in the Bay Area, including two deaths reported in Santa Clara County on Monday.        Now Playing:     As Bay Area deals with the Coronavirus there are fewer people out in the city and in the streets making the Bay Area look and sound different as the population practices social distancing.   Video: San Francisco Chronicle     Increasingly aggressive responses — such as limiting large gatherings and closing schools — have not slowed the spread of the disease, and public health officials agreed over the weekend that much more restrictive tactics were needed to force people apart. Authorities fear that regional hospitals could be overwhelmed by a crush of seriously ill patients if the virus is allowed to keep spreading as it has been.  In the six Bay Area counties and Santa Cruz, non-essential gatherings of any size are now banned, along with non-essential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit.” People may travel for shopping for necessary supplies, accessing health care and providing aid to family and friends who need assistance, and for non-residents, returning to their homes outside the region.  Airports, taxis and public transit — including BART — will remain operational, but only for essential travel, and people are expected to keep 6 feet apart when possible. BART officials said they would ensure “long enough trains to allow for social distancing.”        Now Playing:     Here is what you need to know about the coronavirus.   Video: Manjula Varghese     People in the seven counties will still be able to go shopping for items such as food and household supplies, and seek medical care. They will be able to go outside for fresh air or exercise as long as they keep away from anyone they don’t already live with.  People who are homeless are exempt from the order but encouraged to find shelter. In response to the directives, Alameda and San Francisco counties announced they were suspending all evictions.  People who are older or have underlying health problems are being told to stay inside at all times except for health care, under the new directive. They should ask someone to shop for them if they are able.  The order calls for all “routine medical appointments” and elective procedures to be canceled or rescheduled. “To the extent possible, all health care visits that are not canceled or rescheduled should be done remotely,” the order states.  In San Francisco, Police Chief Bill Scott said his department would be “looking for voluntary compliance” with the health order. Police could cite people for failing to comply with it — but Scott was clear that such a measure was an “absolute last resort.”  Grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open, and restaurants may stay open to provide takeout food only. Also staying open: veterinary services, gas stations and auto repair shops, hardware and other home supply stores, banks and laundry services. Businesses that remain open are encouraged to keep both employees and customers 6 feet apart, including while standing in line. But there are no specific limitations on the number of people allowed inside.  Daycare centers may stay open, but children must be kept in groups no larger than 12, and they must stay with the same group of children every day.  For area residents, it is just the latest in a series of steps pushing them to their homes, away from the office, large gatherings and other social activities in recent weeks. Rashid Ibarra said he’s already steeped in a social isolation mind-set, after weeks of worsening news about the virus.  “I know what it means to have the president declare a state of emergency,” Ibarra said. “I was supposed to be at work today but I called in.” His employer has given workers an advance on their sick time, he said.  At the corner of Larkin Street and Golden Gate Avenue, he said his immediate plans were “to go get some pastries and then go and kick it at the pad.”  Solano County public health officials said they did not plan to join the regional shelter-in-place orders. But they said high-risk people, including older adults, are advised to follow similar recommendations. Sonoma and Napa county officials said they were watching the situation but had no immediate plans to issue a similar order.  The announcement came just a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom advised that all bars in the state be closed , and that restaurants reduce capacity. Several states have announced closures of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, and instituted curfews. Also on Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged that all gatherings of 50 or people or more be stopped nationwide — the agency’s strongest advisory so far. As of Monday morning, confirmed U.S. COVID-19 cases had topped 4,000, but the actual number of infected people is said to be far higher.  And on Monday, President Trump advised Americans to avoid bars and restaurants, and any social gatherings of 10 or more people.  “We are in a rough place. And we are going to have difficult times ahead of us,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo County health officer, said at a Monday news conference in San Jose. “The measures that we are putting in place are temporary. But they will last longer than any of us want. This is the time to unite as a community, to come to each others’ aid and dig really deep.”  San Francisco Chronicle staff writers Dominic Fracassa, J.K.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/california-stay-at-home-beach-goers/index.html,"(CNN) Crowds descended on California beaches, hiking trails and parks over the weekend in open defiance of a state order to shelter in place and avoid close contact with others.

People are seen on the beach on March 21, 2020 in Huntington Beach, California.

Instead, many public spaces were packed, prompting officials in some cities to order parks, recreation areas and beaches to close.

'People packing beaches'

Video and photos on social media showed groups of people standing in close contact of one another at popular hiking trails and beaches in Los Angeles over the weekend. Health officials urge people to maintain a distance of 6 feet from one another to prevent transmission of the highly contagious virus.

A bike path in Huntington Beach, California was packed Saturday despite a shelter in place order from the Governor.

In response to the crowds, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced on Twitter late Sunday that he was closing sports and recreation at all LA City Parks. He also tweeted that parking at city beaches was closed.

""This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks,"" the Mayor tweeted. He said people should heed the closures and stay home. ""That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives.""

This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks. So we are closing sports and recreation at @LACityParks and closing parking at city beaches. That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives. — Mayor Eric Garcetti (@MayorOfLA) March 23, 2020

Garcetti told CNN affiliate KTLA that he was working with officials in neighboring cities and the county to address large crowds at beaches.

Meanwhile, the city of Santa Monica closed its beach parking Sunday to deter people from flocking to the beach.

Further south, the city of Long Beach closed many of its recreation facilities. On Sunday night, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said in a tweet that the city had closed skate parks, dog parks, playgrounds, picnic areas as well as volleyball, tennis and basketball courts.

The city is trying to discourage people from playing team sports and encourage them to maintain a social distance of 6 feet when utilizing city facilities.

Garcia tweeted that the city is also looking to establish additional guidance for the use of its beaches.

He said the onus is on residents to comply with the rules as public safety teams may not be able to enforce the orders.

To be clear, the Governor and City's order does allow people to go for a walk or visit a park or beach. However, you must still use social distancing. You can't play team sports, and you must stay 6 feet apart from anyone else. — Mayor Robert Garcia (@LongBeachMayor) March 22, 2020

""More signs are going up at beaches and courts, and we will look to enforce more -- but our public safety teams are incredibly busy,"" Garcia tweeted. ""We need the public to take self responsibility and remember that our doctors, nurses and medical personnel are counting on us.""

California wasn't the only place where people ignored orders to stay home and maintain social distance.

Beaches closed and boating banned in Florida

This weekend several videos showed large groups of people partying on boats and tying their water crafts together in the Biscayne Bay of Miami and outside Boca Raton.

While Lake Boca Raton has always served as a social gathering spot for many boaters, and will again, now is not the time for parties and tie ups on the water. Please be patient, and do your part, so we can all get through this together.

The city of Boca Raton tweeted images of crowded boat parties and discouraged residents from gathering on the water.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez closed marinas and boat ramps in the county Sunday to prevent people from going out to sea to hang out.

Tougher restrictions on boat ramps and marinas are now in place in addition to the other steps Miami-Dade is taking to combat new cases of COVID-19. As of this writing 177 cases had been confirmed in Miami-Dade County. Here is today's update: https://t.co/n1giPmYfaR — Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez (@MayorGimenez) March 22, 2020

""I am disappointed to see photos and videos on social media of boats close together and large groups of people congregating,"" Gimenez said in a news release Sunday. ""We are in a state of emergency, and I cannot stress enough the need for personal responsibility.""

Beaches throughout Florida closed for the weekend to prevent spring breakers and residents from gathering on the beach.

On Friday, several beaches in the state closed to the public and hotels in Miami-Dade County were ordered to vacate by Monday night.

The mayor said the Miami-Dade Police Department will be out on the water ""ramping up enforcement"" of the no rafting order issued by the mayor on Friday to prevent large gatherings and parties on boats.

Park closures around the country

Parks from coast to coast were closed by local authorities over the weekend in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus.

Oregon State Parks announced on Facebook Sunday that all state parks would be closed until at least May 8.

The National Park Service has closed some locations and is keeping others open when possible, according to its website. The Park Service also waived entrance fees to help visitors maintain social distance.","                       US Crime + Justice Energy + Environment Extreme Weather Space + Science Edition U.S. International Arabic Español Crime + Justice Energy + Environment Extreme Weather Space + Science Search Edition U.S. International Arabic Español World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics Donald Trump Supreme Court Congress Facts First 2020 Election Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Health Food Fitness Wellness Parenting Vital Signs Entertainment Stars Screen Binge Culture Media Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food and Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Equestrian Golf Skiing Horse Racing Motorsport Formula E Esports Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Weather Climate Storm Tracker Video Follow CNN      Crowds packed California beaches despite shelter in place order By Hollie Silverman and Sarah Moon, CNN Updated 0756 GMT (1556 HKT) March 23, 2020 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/breaking-georgia-governor-orders-shelter-place-curb-coronavirus/vdAoWkjq39W2usr9e8W8BL/,"Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday said he is preparing a statewide shelter-in-place order across Georgia to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a turnabout after weeks of balking at taking more drastic steps to combat the pandemic.

The new rules, which he will issue Thursday, are set to run from Friday through April 13. He also said he would immediately sign an order that would close k-12 schools through the rest of the academic year.

The Republican faced mounting pressure from public health officials, local leaders and prominent politicians who warned that a failure to take more sweeping action would further strain Georgia’s health care system and lead to more deaths.

“I want to encourage my fellow Georgians to hang in there. I know you’re tired of this,” he said at a windy press conference outside the state Capitol. “But we must first overcome the obstacles in our path.”

Kemp had balked at more stringent restrictions to combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, in part because he was worried more severe bans would cripple the economy in parts of the state where there are few known cases of the illness.

But he reversed course Wednesday as a growing number of other Republican governors, including the leaders of Florida, South Carolina and Texas, instituted broader limits on mobility and shuttered more businesses to try to counter the disease.

He said his decision was triggered by ""game-changing” new projections on the disease’s spread in Georgia. He also said he was informed of new data that this virus “is now transmitting before people see signs.”

“Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt” symptoms, he said. “We didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.”

Brian Kemp (center) speaks during a press conference at Liberty Plaza, across the street from the Georgia State Capitol building, in downtown Atlanta, Wednesday, April 1, 2020. During the presser, Gov. Kemp ordered all Georgia K-12 schools to be closed until the end of the academic school year. He also said he will sign an order on Thursday forcing a ""Stay-at-home"" order for all Georgians until April 13.

Health officials have long known that the virus could be transmitted this way, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently changed their guidance on this type of asymptomatic infection.

That contributed to significant changes in state projections on testing, hospital capacity and virus transmission rates that led Dr. Kathleen Toomey, the head of Georgia’s Department of Public Health, to endorse more severe restrictions.

“It’s a combination of recognizing there’s a large number of people out there who are infected, who are asymptomatic, who never would have been recognized under our old models,” she said, “but also seeing the community transmission that we’re seeing.”

‘All over the place’



Kemp said the shelter-in-place order comes with exceptions including grocery stores, medical suppliers and certain manufacturing. Kemp aides say it’s likely to allow restaurants to serve takeout but ban dine-in service.

“People have to eat. We have to continue to process our food supply. We have to have our pharmacies open, we have to have Georgia-based companies that are making (personal protective equipment for doctors, nurses and other caregivers), medical supplies,” he said. “These are hard things to figure out.”



The governor said law enforcement would actively require residents to comply with the restrictions, though he urged Georgians not to panic and make a run on stores.

“The grocers are ready for this. They’ll be ready to restock,” he said. “People don’t need to be worried about buying for two weeks or two months.”

The governor earlier shut down bars, banned many gatherings, canceled public school through late April and urged the “medically fragile” and others vulnerable to the disease to stay at home.

Gov. Brian Kemp said Wednesday that he is issuing a statewide shelter-in-place order as the state continues to battle the coronavirus.

But he expressed concern at taking more sweeping steps, such as a mandatory shelter-in-place order, in part because he worried they could cripple the economy in areas where there are no confirmed cases of the virus.

Instead, he’s given local leaders leeway to take steps on their own, and dozens of cities and counties have enacted curfews, shuttered nonessential businesses and issued shelter-in-place orders.

That’s led to a hodgepodge of uneven restrictions across the state that morph by the day, along with rising criticism from local officials that stricter uniformity is needed.

And his top aide fanned more confusion over the weekend by warning of an “overreach” by local officials.

Kemp’s announcement was preceded by sharpening criticism from local officials.

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said “cities need some consistency – because right now, we’re all over the place.” And state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, accused Kemp of taking half-measures.

“We are in a crisis, our governor is dragging his feet and playing catch-up when millions of lives are at stake,” said Williams, who revealed last week that she tested positive for COVID-19.

The new shelter-in-place rules were greeted with guarded relief by his critics.

“Better late than never,” said state Rep. Scott Holcomb, D-Atlanta. “Crises demand big and fast responses. Instead, we’ve had nothing but incrementalism. That means it’s going to take longer and longer to move past this.”

Ben@BenGray.com for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution      Georgia governor to order shelter in place to curb coronavirus           By   Greg Bluestein    Kemp also orders k-12 schools closed for rest of academic year             Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday said he is preparing a statewide shelter-in-place order across Georgia to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a turnabout after weeks of balking at taking more drastic steps to combat the pandemic.       The new rules, which he will issue Thursday, are set to run from Friday through April 13. He also said he would immediately sign an order that would close k-12 schools through the rest of the academic year.         The Republican faced mounting pressure from public health officials, local leaders and prominent politicians who warned that a failure to take more sweeping action would further strain Georgia’s health care system and lead to more deaths.   “I want to encourage my fellow Georgians to hang in there. I know you’re tired of this,” he said at a windy press conference outside the state Capitol. “But we must first overcome the obstacles in our path.” Kemp had balked at more stringent restrictions to combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, in part because he was worried more severe bans would cripple the economy in parts of the state where there are few known cases of the illness.  But he reversed course Wednesday as a growing number of other Republican governors, including the leaders of Florida , South Carolina and Texas, instituted broader limits on mobility and shuttered more businesses to try to counter the disease.  He said his decision was triggered by ""game-changing” new projections on the disease’s spread in Georgia. He also said he was informed of new data that this virus “is now transmitting before people see signs.” “Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt” symptoms, he said. “We didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.”                            04/01/2020 - Atlanta, Georgia  - Gov. Brian Kemp (center) speaks during a press conference at Liberty Plaza, across the street from the Georgia State Capitol building, in downtown Atlanta, Wednesday, April 1, 2020. During the presser, Gov. Kemp ordered all Georgia K-12 schools to be closed until the end of the academic school year. He also said he will sign an order on Thursday forcing a ""Stay-at-home"" order for all Georgians until April 13.

https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/pritzker-to-order-shelter-in-place-to-illinois-residents-report,"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials, joining similar dramatic efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Pritzker’s order, which takes effect Saturday at 5 p.m. and is set to expire April 7, still allows the state’s 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.

“If there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation,” Pritzker said. The Democrat said he was trying to prevent “potentially tens of thousands” of deaths but urged people not to panic.

“For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much,” he said, adding that people can continue to shop for groceries and visit pharmacies, gas stations and banks. Residents also can continue to pick up meals from restaurants and exercise outdoors, he said.

Pritzker acknowledged that the state doesn’t have the resources or “the desire” to broadly enforce the order, but he said law enforcement will take action if necessary in individual cases. The order exempts people who work in many essential industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation and food production or sales, including at grocery stores and restaurants.

The stay-at-home order will also mean schools statewide remain closed until April 8, he said.

Pritzker had previously ordered all schools statewide to shut down through the end of March and limited gatherings to 50 people to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He also closed dine-in service at bars and restaurants, but allowed businesses to continue delivery or carryout options.

The governors of California and New York have issued similar orders.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who stood by Pritzker’s side as he announced the order, said she agreed with the decision.

“Think of this as safer at home,” she said.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

https://abcnews.go.com/US/michigan-rally-shelter-place-order-spills-capitol-building/story?id=70432928,"Protesters, some armed, spill into Michigan Capitol building demanding end to stay-at-home order The state legislature is debating extending Michigan's state of emergency.

Hundreds of protesters entered the Michigan State Capitol building Thursday and crowded its halls and staircases demanding that the state legislature not extend Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus stay-at-home order.

Numerous protesters, some not wearing masks, got into the faces of state police officers stationed inside the building and shouted to be let into the chambers, which are closed to visitors due to health precautions.

State legislators were meeting to discuss extending Michigan's state of emergency, which was issued on March 10 and was slated to end on Thursday.

""Vote no!"" protesters shouted inside the building.

The legislature’s decision won't affect Whitmer's stay-at-home order, which was enacted on March 24 and will remain in effect until May 15. However, it could affect her emergency powers going forward.

Michigan Senator Dayna Polehanki tweeted a photo showing several men, at least one of them armed, on the balcony inside the building, and said that several of her colleagues had donned bulletproof vests.

""I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,"" she tweeted.

It is legal in Michigan to carry a firearm in public ""as long as the person is carrying the firearm with lawful intent and the firearm is not concealed,"" according to the state police.

Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, said the governor respects citizens' right to protest, but that they shouldn't be putting themselves or first responders at risk of catching the virus.

""It’s disappointing to see people congregating without masks, and without practicing social distancing. This kind of activity will put more people at risk, and it could mean that more people will die,"" she said in a statement.

As of Thursday morning, Michigan had more than 40,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,600 deaths, according to data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Whitmer has come under attack from protesters who argue that her COVID-19 precautions are too strict and are costing them their livelihoods.

On Friday, Whitmer amended her shelter-in-place order to allow people to perform certain jobs such as construction, and to go to recreational areas such as golf courses, as long as they practice strict social distancing. A Michigan judge also ruled in favor of the governor in a lawsuit against her office, determining that her shelter-in-place order didn't infringe on residents' constitutional rights.

""Governor Whitmer understands that this is a frustrating time and that many people are angry,"" Brown said in a statement. ""People want to spend time with their families, friends, and loved ones.""

Thursday's protests began earlier in the morning with the crowds, some of whom were armed with guns and rifles, piling up outside the building with homemade signs. Rally members drove their cars around the perimeter honking their horns.

Michigan State Police representative Lt. Brian Oleksy told ABC News that there were between 400 and 700 people at Thursday's rally. No summonses were issued however two people were arrested for allegedly getting into a fight between themselves, according to Olesky.

Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus stay-at-home order. Numerous protesters, some not wearing masks, got into the faces of state police officers stationed inside the building and shouted to be let into the chambers, which are closed to visitors due to health precautions. State legislators were meeting to discuss extending Michigan's state of emergency, which was issued on March 10 and was slated to end on Thursday.

Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images The legislature’s decision won't affect Whitmer's stay-at-home order, which was enacted on March 24 and will remain in effect until May 15. However, it could affect her emergency powers going forward. Michigan Senator Dayna Polehanki tweeted a photo showing several men, at least one of them armed, on the balcony inside the building, and said that several of her colleagues had donned bulletproof vests. ""I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,"" she tweeted. It is legal in Michigan to carry a firearm in public ""as long as the person is carrying the firearm with lawful intent and the firearm is not concealed,"" according to the state police. Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, said the governor respects citizens' right to protest, but that they shouldn't be putting themselves or first responders at risk of catching the virus. ""It’s disappointing to see people congregating without masks, and without practicing social distancing. This kind of activity will put more people at risk, and it could mean that more people will die,"" she said in a statement.

As of Thursday morning, Michigan had more than 40,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,600 deaths, according to data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Whitmer has come under attack from protesters who argue that her COVID-19 precautions are too strict and are costing them their livelihoods.

https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/1-500-tn-physicians-urge-governor-to-order-shelter-in-place,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — More than 1,500 physicians from across the state - including heads of the major medical organizations - are pleading for Gov. Bill Lee to order Tennesseans to shelter in place in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.

A letter delivered to the governor sounds the alarm about what it calls an ""escalating and destructive situation.""

In response, on Saturday, the Middle Tennessee Mayors Caucus endorsed the proposal, calling for Lee to ""consider the recommendation of the medical community to implement this directive.""

""We are at a crossroads,"" Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pulmonary specialist from Franklin, said in an exclusive interview with NewsChannel 5 Investigates.

""We are standing on the edge of the abyss. We are looking over the abyss. And what we do today will decide whether we are able to step back or to jump over.""

The letter, which has been signed by more than 1,500 Tennessee physicians, warns that ""we have little time to 'flatten the curve' on the current situation.""

""China and South Korea have made great strides by prohibiting travel and closure of non-essential industry and business. We must act with the same level of boldness,"" the letter continues

It suggests that the order to shelter in place should last for 14 days to give health officials a chance to get a handle on the coronavirus crisis.

""The state of Tennessee has a narrow window,"" Milstone said.

""That window will likely close within the next seven to 10 days - and then the spread of the virus will be so rampant that - no matter what we do - it will not prevent patients with the virus here in Tennessee dying or being critically ill from this illness.""

Among those signing the letter are leaders of the Tennessee American College of Emergency Physicians, the Tennessee American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the Tennessee Medical Association.

It comes just a day after Lee suggested mandatory lockdowns were not his style.

""We’re never going to be able to mandate people’s behavior in their homes and in their yards and in their neighborhoods,"" Lee told reporters.

""I believe to the degree that we can curb behavior and find responsible behavior taking place across our state, to the degree that we can do that without mandates, is better for everyone. So that’s going to be our approach.""

Dr. David Aronoff, a Nashville physician who is one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, told NewsChannel 5 Investigates that ""we want to be stacking as many cards in our favor as we possibly can to protect lives.""

""I think we need to be able to look back and say we did everything we could in our power to prevent it from being worse, and I think that's where we are at in asking for shelter-in-place mandate,"" Aronoff added.

WATCH OUR INTERVIEW WITH DR. ARONOFF BELOW

Milstone explained that ""sheltering in place means going only to the grocery story for essentials, going to the pharmacy for essentials, not going out to eat, not going to bars, not working out in gyms, staying home whenever possible.""

The Williamson County physician said the situation is urgent because Tennessee hospitals are not equipped for what might happen if a shelter in place order is not given.

""If we do not shelter in place, then the disease will continue to spread and then we will become more of a center for the disease,"" Milstone said.

""So what you are seeing on the coasts of the United States - California, Washington, New York, even to the south of us, say, Lousiana, New Orleans - those could become our new reality if we do not go forward with the shelter in place.""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-q1-earnings-75-billion-10000-per-second/,"Amazon recorded sales of $75.4 billion in the first three months of the year, a first-quarter record for the ecommerce giant, as many consumers stepped up their online purchases during coronavirus-fueled lockdowns.

That translates into nearly $10,000 in sales every second, according to calculations from Christopher Rossbach, portfolio manager of the J. Stern & Co. World Stars Global Equity fund.

""The numbers are frankly staggering,"" Rossbach said in a note.

Amazon's North America sales rose 29%, while AWS — the company's huge cloud-computing segment — increased 33%, the company said in an earnings release Thursday. At the same time, its costs of fulfilling all those customer orders jumped 34% as it hired thousands of new workers and increased pay. Amazon posted an operating profit of $3.9 billion for the quarter, a nearly 10% drop from this period last year.

The ""current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon's business as never before, but it's also the hardest time we've ever faced,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos said the company would spend at least $4 billion on costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak in the coming three months, outlining an increase in personal protective equipment and pay bumps for workers, more intense cleaning of warehouses, and about $300 million to develop internal coronavirus testing capabilities.

Amazon and Instacart workers walking off job amid safety concerns over coronavirus

Some Amazon workers say those measures aren't sufficient. Amazon and Whole Foods workers have called for a strike on Friday, asking for better paid leave policies, more protective equipment and a reinstatement of workers who have been fired after speaking out.

Amazon's financial success stands in stark contrast with the many brick-and-mortar stores that have been forced to shut their doors during the pandemic.

Despite Amazon's higher costs, the pandemic could very well work out in the company's favor if it uses the opportunity to integrate itself even more deeply into the lives of customers both old and new.

""The crisis will hopefully be short-lived, but the impact on Amazon could be profound over the long term, with over 150 [million] Prime members now active. Habits will form, and many of these people will shop more using Amazon in the future,"" Rossbach said.","              Coronavirus Updates      Breaking News Emails      Lives To Remember      Texas Mask Order      Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested      Miami-Dade Police      Amanda Kloots Interview      Iran Nuclear Facility                    News      US      World      Politics      Entertainment      Health      MoneyWatch      Technology      Science      Crime      Sports          Missing soldier murdered by Army specialist, woman alleges in complaint      Texas governor issues mandatory mask policy      White couple arrested after gun pulled on Black family      105 University of Washington frat members have coronavirus      One officer involved in Elijah McClain photo investigation resigns      20 Khashoggi murder suspects on trial in Turkey in absentia      FedEx asks Washington Redskins to change their name      Supreme Court blocks curbside voting in Alabama during pandemic      2 cops charged with murder for alleged excessive use of stun guns             Shows     CBS This Morning      CBS Evening News      60 Minutes      CBS This Morning: Saturday      Face The Nation      Sunday Morning      48 Hours      CBSN Originals      NCIS: The Cases They Can't Forget       Live      LIVE      More      Latest      Video      Photos      Podcasts      In Depth      Local       Log In      Newsletters      Mobile      RSS      CBS Store       Search      Search:            Live   Watch CBSN Live            Amazon makes $10,000 per second as shoppers shelter in place              By Irina Ivanova   May 1, 2020 / 12:41 PM / MoneyWatch        Amazon employees makes damning accusations          Amazon recorded sales of $75.4 billion in the first three months of the year, a first-quarter record for the ecommerce giant, as many consumers stepped up their online purchases during coronavirus -fueled lockdowns.

https://justthenews.com/nation/technology/elon-musk-calls-shelter-place-measures-forcibly-imprisoning-population-earnings,"Tesla's earnings call Wednesday got heated when Elon Musk described as “fascist” the social-distancing measures in effect across the country.

“This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their g*d*** freedom,” railed the CEO.

Musk also cautioned that the shelter-in-place orders in California, where Tesla has a major factory, could pose a threat to the company. The car factory, in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to close in late-March to help mitigate the spread of the virus.

“We are a little bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,” Musk said on the call. “The extension of the shelter-in-place or frankly what I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights … will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but many companies.”

He added that shelter-in-place orders are “not why people came to America or built this country.”

Tesla posted a quarterly gain of 32%, but the pandemic shutdown may require the company to cut production by more than 500,000 vehicles in 2020.","       Skip to content                      Search               Government    Politics    Accountability    Nation    World    Podcasts    Shop                   Government    White House    Local    Security    Diplomacy    Congress    Courts & Law    State Houses    Federal Agencies      Politics    All Things Trump    Cybersecurity    Education    Elections    Energy    Environment    Finance    Coronavirus    Polling    Privacy    Regulation    Transportation      Accountability    Media    Political Ethics    Waste, Fraud and Abuse    Watchdogs    Whistleblowers    Russia and Ukraine Scandals      Nation    Crime    Culture    Economy    Science    Technology    Extremism    Free Speech    Religion      World    Africa    Asia    Australia    Canada    Europe    Latin America    Mexico    Middle East      Podcasts    John Solomon Reports    The Pod's Honest Truth With David Brody    The Sharyl Attkisson Podcast      Shop       Search            Follow Us                              Breadcrumb    Home    Nation    Technology                           Elon Musk calls shelter-in-place measures 'forcibly imprisoning' the population on earnings call     The CEO repeatedly called the nation's shelter-in-place orders a violation of constitutional rights             Image      Tesla CEO Elon Musk  (Frederic Brown / Getty Images)               By Sophie Mann     Last Updated: April 30, 2020 - 3:46pm            Article  Dig In      Tesla's earnings call Wednesday got heated when Elon Musk described as “fascist” the social-distancing measures in effect across the country.  “This is not democratic, this is not freedom.

He is feeling well, and will continue to anchor his 9 p.m. program ""Cuomo Prime Time"" from his home.

""In these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for coronavirus,"" Cuomo wrote in a message on Twitter

""I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fevers, chills and shortness of breath,"" he wrote. ""I just hope I didn't give it to the kids and Cristina. That would make me feel worse than this illness!""

Cuomo was most recently at CNN's offices in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City last Friday. He anchored from his home on Monday, and interviewed his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The two men traded brotherly barbs about the anchorman's basement live shot location.

https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-tells-employees-they-can-work-from-home-permanently-2020-5,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told employees in an email on Tuesday that they could keep working from home indefinitely, even after COVID-19 lockdowns end.

Twitter won't open most of its offices until September at the earliest, a representative told Business Insider.

It's one of the most generous work-from-home policies put forward by a major tech company in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Other tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook have told employees that they can keep working from home through this fall.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told employees in an email on Tuesday that they would be allowed to work from home indefinitely, even after COVID-19 shutdowns end.

Dorsey also said Twitter's offices wouldn't be reopened until September at the earliest, BuzzFeed News first reported. Twitter told employees to start working from home in March, but the offer doesn't extend to employees whose jobs mandate that they return to the office, like those tasked with server maintenance.

A Twitter representative told Business Insider that the decision meshed with the company's broader mission to support employees working from anywhere, adding that ""the past few months have proven we can make that work.""

""Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs,"" the representative told Business Insider. ""When we do decide to open offices, it also won't be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual.""

The new policy also means that most open roles at Twitter will be remote-optional going forward, Dorsey said.

Twitter will continue to suspend business travel and won't hold any in-person events for the rest of 2020, the representative said. The company will assess 2021 events later this year.

Other major tech companies have announced lenient work-from-home plans, but few go as far as Twitter's. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon have all told employees that they can keep working from home through the fall, even if their offices reopen sooner.

Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, Dorsey had voiced plans to encourage a ""distributed workforce"" with more remote employees living outside San Francisco, where the company is headquartered.

""I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce now, and I do think we have to build a company that's not entirely dependent on San Francisco,"" Dorsey said during an earnings call in February. ""As we look forward, we're reaching a talent pool that expects a lot more remote work … We should be building our company around that. I haven't made any plans just yet for this year, but I do expect that I will travel.""","                                       The words ""Business Insider"".

https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/30/no-nintendo-direct-planned-for-june-due-to-work-from-home-hurdles/,"Nintendo is telling partner developers it’s not going to hold one of its Nintendo Direct video events in June. The publisher has had a June Direct to correspond with E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) every year since 2013. And before that, it held annual stage presentations. But complications brought about from Japan’s work-from-home order as part of its attempts to mitigate COVID-19 are forcing Nintendo to push back its schedule.

Nintendo was putting together a June event. The company was lining up partners and was planning to unveil its first-party schedule for the rest of 2020. That included highlighting the Mario franchise’s 35th anniversary, which it’s going to celebrate with the release of some classic 3D Mario games on Switch, according to various reports.

But now, the company is far less certain. If it holds another Direct, it may not come until the very end of summer.

I’ve reached out to Nintendo. The company did not respond for a comment.

But the company’s statement from the start of the March 26 Nintendo Direct Mini is as good a comment as any:

“Due to COVID-19, release dates and other information … are subject to change.”

The June Nintendo Direct may be a victim of Japan’s cultural clash with work-from-home

Nintendo is not unique in its struggles to adapt to a work-from-home model. That’s especially true in Japan, where a number of companies were not prepared for this kind of shift. And even weeks after Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe enacted a state-of-emergency, corporations in the country are still trying to catch up. It turns out that you can’t remold Japanese business culture in a handful of weeks.

The issue is that while many people outside of Japan view the country as on the cutting edge of technology, this isn’t the case will all aspects of its business culture. In a story in The Washington Post, reporter Simon Denyer explains that many IT departments and corporate strategies haven’t changed in Japan since the 1990s. Companies still regularly use fax to send documents, and they have “little awareness of cloud computing or video conferencing tools.”

But that tech aversion extends beyond the workplace and into people’s homes. As Yuri Kageyama writes for the AP, “many Japanese lack the basic tools needed to work from home.” This includes personal computers, but often people don’t even have Wi-Fi.

The slow embrace of the cloud and other tools, however, is likely less about a fear of technology. Japan places supreme importance on conducting business with face-to-face meetings. Decision-makers throughout the Japanese economy believe that they cannot show proper respect without appearing in-person.

Nintendo is working through how to maintain its culture while also keeping its workers safe. But that’s going to take time. The publisher is also just not sure how to produce a high-quality Direct outside of a studio. That’s something it may figure out, but again, it’s not going to rush through that to meet a June timeframe for an E3 that doesn’t exist.","           Channels    GamesBeat    AI    AR/VR    Big Data    Business    Cloud    Commerce    Dev    Enterprise    Entrepreneur    Esports    Marketing    Media    Mobile    PC Gaming    Security    Social    Transportation      Got a news tip?

Image Credit: Nintendo       Nintendo is telling partner developers it’s not going to hold one of its Nintendo Direct video events in June . The publisher has had a June Direct to correspond with E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) every year since 2013. And before that, it held annual stage presentations. But complications brought about from Japan’s work-from-home order as part of its attempts to mitigate COVID-19 are forcing Nintendo to push back its schedule.  Nintendo was putting together a June event. The company was lining up partners and was planning to unveil its first-party schedule for the rest of 2020. That included highlighting the Mario franchise’s 35th anniversary, which it’s going to celebrate with the release of some classic 3D Mario games on Switch , according to various reports.  But now, the company is far less certain. If it holds another Direct, it may not come until the very end of summer.  I’ve reached out to Nintendo. The company did not respond for a comment.  VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17. Join leading AI executives: Register for the free livestream . But the company’s statement from the start of the March 26 Nintendo Direct Mini is as good a comment as any:  “Due to COVID-19, release dates and other information … are subject to change.”  The June Nintendo Direct may be a victim of Japan’s cultural clash with work-from-home  Nintendo is not unique in its struggles to adapt to a work-from-home model. That’s especially true in Japan, where a number of companies were not prepared for this kind of shift. And even weeks after Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe enacted a state-of-emergency, corporations in the country are still trying to catch up. It turns out that you can’t remold Japanese business culture in a handful of weeks.  The issue is that while many people outside of Japan view the country as on the cutting edge of technology, this isn’t the case will all aspects of its business culture. In a story in The Washington Post , reporter Simon Denyer explains that many IT departments and corporate strategies haven’t changed in Japan since the 1990s. Companies still regularly use fax to send documents, and they have “little awareness of cloud computing or video conferencing tools.”  But that tech aversion extends beyond the workplace and into people’s homes. As Yuri Kageyama writes for the AP , “many Japanese lack the basic tools needed to work from home.” This includes personal computers, but often people don’t even have Wi-Fi.  The slow embrace of the cloud and other tools, however, is likely less about a fear of technology. Japan places supreme importance on conducting business with face-to-face meetings. Decision-makers throughout the Japanese economy believe that they cannot show proper respect without appearing in-person.  Nintendo is working through how to maintain its culture while also keeping its workers safe. But that’s going to take time. The publisher is also just not sure how to produce a high-quality Direct outside of a studio. That’s something it may figure out, but again, it’s not going to rush through that to meet a June timeframe for an E3 that doesn’t exist .

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/04/why-many-employees-are-hoping-to-work-from-home-even-after-the-pandemic-is-over.html,"At Limeade, Hamill says they're already thinking of ways in which they can make their current flexible work program more accommodating. Before the pandemic, she says employees had the option to work remotely, but due to scheduling and business demands workers were still needed in the office multiple days a week. Now, she says, ""we're considering actually flipping the paradigm and saying, 'What's the day that we all want to be in [the office] together?'"" This way, she says, if they select one in-office day for in-person meetings and activities, then employees have the rest of the week to work from home if they choose.

Like Hamill, many others are hoping to make their home office more of a permanent work space in the future. In fact, nearly 43% of full-time American employees say they want to work remotely more often even after the economy has reopened, according to a survey released by business publishing company getAbstract . Of the more than 1,200 employees surveyed between April 16 and April 17, nearly 20% said their employer is actively discussing how they can make remote work more of an option in the future.

""To me it sort of takes the edge off of the second shift,"" she tells CNBC Make It . ""I can start the dishwasher in the middle of the day or I can put out the chicken to cook for a later meal."" She adds that for her, working remotely has been a huge advantage as a parent.

Like millions of Americans, Laura Hamill, chief people officer and chief science officer at software company Limeade , has been forced to work from home since early March in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Though today's forced remote culture has been an adjustment for many, the mom of two teenagers says she looks forward to the possibility of working from home more often even after the pandemic subsides.

Andrew Savikas, chief strategy officer at getAbstract, says one of the biggest reasons why employees prefer to work remotely is because they get to save time on their daily commute. On average, Americans spent roughly 27 minutes on their one-way commute to work in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. This equates to over 200 hours spent commuting per year.

""People like having that time back,"" Savikas says, while adding that employees also like the flexibility of working remotely because they can ""structure the day how they want.""

According to a joint CNBC/Change Research survey of more than 5,000 voters in swing states, 47% said the time they would normally spend on commuting has now been used to spend more time with their family. The survey, which gathered responses between April 17 and April 18, also found that employees have been spending the time they save on their commute to sleep more, focus on various hobbies and get more work done.

Raymond ""RJ"" Jones says he's seen first-hand how a remote work schedule can positively impact your personal and professional life. Prior to stepping into his current remote position as executive vice president of finance and growth at eXp World Holdings, a cloud-based real estate company, Jones spent his entire career working in an office.

He says his last job, which was vice president of investor relations at Zillow, required him to spend roughly two hours commuting to and from work each day. ""I live in Tacoma, [Washington] and would commute to Seattle each day,"" he says of his regular commute to Zillow's office. ""It was guaranteed at least an hour on the bus or train each way, and that's with perfect traffic.""

Now, Jones says, ""the commuting nightmare is gone"" since his current role allows him to work remote full-time. Before the pandemic, Jones, who has a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter, says his flexible schedule allowed him to go to his ""kid's sporting events and help out with family logistics."" He explains that with his wife being an attorney and having a work schedule that is just as demanding as his, the ability to work from home took ""so much of the burden off of her."" Moving forward, he says, workplace flexibility will remain a top priority in his career.

While the current pandemic is certainly unprecedented, Savikas says its impact has only reinforced a lot of the changes we were already seeing. ""E-commerce was already a big thing. Home grocery delivery was already a thing, and working from home was already a thing [for some],"" he says. ""It's just that we've encountered five years worth of change in five weeks and that can be a little bit jarring.""

The executive says he hopes this pandemic will provide ""one of those rare opportunities to radically rethink the way we work and live."" This includes, he says, having ""less time spent in cars, less pollution and a chance for people to reclaim some flexibility and have more work-life balance.""

BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s labor minister wants to enshrine into law the right to work from home if it is feasible to do so, even after the coronavirus pandemic subsides.

Labor Minister Hubertus Heil told Sunday’s edition of the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that he aims to put forward such legislation this fall. He said initial estimates suggest the proportion of the work force working from home has risen from 12% to 25% during the virus crisis, to around 8 million people.

“Everyone who wants to and whose job allows it should be able to work in a home office, even when the corona pandemic is over,” Heil was quoted as saying. “We are learning in the pandemic how much work can be done from home these days.”

Heil stressed that “we want to enable more home working, but not force it.” He said people could choose to switch entirely to working from home, or do so for only one or two days per week.

Heil’s center-left Social Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, had already called in December — long before the virus epidemic brought public life in Germany and elsewhere to a near-standstill — for the establishment of a right to work from home.

Germany’s main employer group rejected the idea. The chief executive of the Confederation of German Employers’ Associations, Steffen Kampeter, said mobile work is in everyone’s interest when it is possible and makes sense, but “operational issues and customers’ wishes must play a central role.”

“We need a moratorium on burdens instead of further requirements that limit growth and flexibility,” he said.","AP NEWS Top Stories Topics Video Listen AP RADIO Update hourly Search ADVERTISEMENT https://apnews.com/44740743a698a80c058b75b8f8af3c8e Click to copy https://apnews.com/44740743a698a80c058b75b8f8af3c8e Click to copy Related topics Technology General News Lifestyle Business Germany Virus Outbreak Europe German minister backs creating legal right to work from home April 26, 2020 GMT German Labor Minister Hubertus Heil attends a news conference about the situation at the job market at a time of coronavirus pandemic in Berlin, Germany, Tuesday, March 31, 2020.

Twitter will allow employees to work from home for as long as they want.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told his employees Tuesday that many of them will be allowed to work from home in perpetuity, even after the coronavirus pandemic ends, according to a company spokesperson.

“Opening offices will be our decision,” the spokesperson said. “When and if our employees come back, will be theirs.”

In an email, first obtained by BuzzFeed News, Dorsey said it was unlikely that Twitter would open its offices before September and that all in-person events would be canceled for the remainder of the year.

The company will assess its plans for 2021 events later this year.

“We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere,” the spokesperson said.

“The past few months have proven we can make that work,” she said. “So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it’s safe to return.”

Twitter's new policy comes as businesses across the nation are struggling to adapt to social distancing guidelines and rethinking how they will operate in a post-pandemic world.

Major tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft were early to move to a work-from-home model and have also been the most cautious in planning for moving employees back into the office.

Google has told employees that the vast majority of them will work from home until 2021, though some will return in the early summer. Facebook will similarly start to reopen offices after the July 4 weekend but will let employees who are able to work from home do so until next year.

The long-term work-from-home policies of these companies stand in stark contrast to much of the rest of the country, where states are slowly easing lockdown restrictions. Governors in several states, including California, where Twitter, Facebook and Google are based, have already started a phased reopening of their economies.","News NBC News NOW Nightly News Meet the Press Dateline MSNBC TODAY After George Floyd Coronavirus Politics OPINION July 4 summer guide U.S. News Business World Podcasts Share this — Search Sections CORONAVIRUS U.S. News Politics World Local Business Health Investigations Culture Matters Science Sports Tech & Media Decision 2020 In Focus Photos Weather Shopping TV Today MSNBC Nightly News Meet The Press Dateline Featured NBC NEWS NOW THINK BETTER NIGHTLY FILMS NBC LEFT FIELD ASIAN AMERICA NBC LATINO NBCBLK NBC OUT STAY TUNED SPECIAL FEATURES NEWSLETTERS PODCASTS More from NBC CNBC NBC.COM NBC LEARN Peacock Productions Next Steps for Vets Parent Toolkit NBC Archives Know Your Value COUPONS Follow NBC News Search Facebook Twitter Email SMS Print Whatsapp Reddit Pocket Flipboard Pinterest Linkedin Coronavirus Twitter employees can work from home forever, CEO says Twitter's new policy comes as businesses across the nation are struggling to adapt to social distancing guidelines.

“I am a HUGE fan of lists. I can spend an hour creating a very comprehensive to-do list. Everything goes on it, including to do the laundry. I find it gives me a very systematic process to go through and also fuels a sense of achievement at the end of the day. There is always so much for me to do, and the days can run away very quickly, so it is important that I am able to prioritize, as well as at the end of the day, see how much I have done in context of how much I did not get to.

“I also am a huge thinker. So, I spend my alone time processing the things I need to do. For example, shower time is a great time for me to process my day and the things that I must get done. I prioritize in that moment the things I must achieve that day, that week, and how it leads to the big picture. I guess there really is an art of taking the biggest projects or goals, and breaking them into small parts with a clear idea of what step one really is. I find when I have a clear head and a clear idea of what I want to achieve in that time period, it keeps me focused and helps me remove all the noise when I get into my day, and it helps me execute with precision. It also helps me to manage things when they go off the rail, because I remember why I am doing what I am doing, and then prepare that the how may completely vary from what I originally intended.”","         73% of African Americans said they did not have emergency funds to cover three months of expenses.  #WeAreDoneDying         TAKE ACTION          Search        ShopBAZAAR  Subscribe   Print Edition  Digital Edition  Give a Gift    Fashion   All Fashion Shows  Street Style  Trends & Shopping Guides  Fashion Photography  Fashion Designers  Fashion Models  Spring Fashion  Summer Fashion  Fall Fashion  Winter Fashion    Beauty   Hairstyles and Colors  Makeup  Skincare  Nails  Diet & Fitness  Mind & Body    Celebrity   Red Carpet Dresses  Parties  Celebrity News  Cover Stories  Makeup    Culture   Film & TV  Art, Books & Music  Interiors & Entertaining  Features    Bazaar Bride   Wedding Fashion  Wedding Planning  Real Weddings  Wedding Beauty    Relationships  Travel & Food  Politics  CR Fashion Book  #TheLIST   The Style List  The Beauty List  The Culture List  The Shopping List  The Best Dressed List    All Videos  Newsletter  TheBUZZ  Giveaways  United States   US  UK  España  Italia  Nederland  台灣  Japan      Do Not Sell My Info     Privacy Notice  Terms of Use            Editions:  US  UK  España  Italia  Nederland  台灣  Japan                     Subscribe    Sign In     My Account  Sign Out                      Type keyword(s) to search               Today's Top Stories   1   Dr. Bernice A.

But as we stay put with our pets, families, and pajamas (the TV is also right there!), how do we stay focused and productive during work hours? Here, women in charge reveal how they get things done away from the office, sharing their tips on how to stay organized, connected, and calm during this time of isolation.

Organization is crucial and I swear by a curated to-do list to keep me on track, no matter where I am. Getting cozy in one of our matching sweat suits always helps too.”      Carly Cushnie, CEO and Creative Director of Cushnie           Courtesy    “It’s important to set a schedule like you would any other day. Wake up, shower, breakfast … it's very easy to just roll out of bed and spend the day in sweatpants going between your couch and the refrigerator. Plan your tasks for the day, including what you plan on eating, so you don’t spend all day snacking, and make sure to plan some outdoor time even if just a five-minute walk (in a non-crowded area if that is accessible to you at this time). A little oxygen will do wonders for your brain.”      Cyndi Ramirez-Fulton, Founder of Chillhouse           Alec Kugler    “For me, the most important thing is to get ready as if you’re going into an office. While I never put on shoes, I have to switch out of pj’s. Having a clean home is also essential to not get distracted. If I HAVE to organize before I kick off my WFH routine, then that’s what needs to happen. Additionally, typing can get daunting, calls give you energy. Human interaction outside of emails or Slack reinvigorate you in great ways.”      Aurora James, Creative Director of Brother Vellies           Max Lakner/BFA.com    “Finding grounding every morning is the most important thing I do to start my day; I use meditation and visualizations. Afterwards, I set clear intentions on what I want to accomplish and action steps. Maintaining a schedule helps me bring structure—a Pilates zoom class at 9 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., etc. A sense of accomplishment goes a long way and scheduling group remote activities keeps my spirits up and maintains a sense of community. Happy people do the best work. Feeding your soul and heart right now is truly one of the most productive things you can do.”      Payal Kadakia, Founder and Executive Chairman of ClassPass           Susmita Patel    “Keep to a set schedule, just as you would if you were working from the office. Wake up early, shower, do your hair and makeup, and dress nicely enough that you feel professional and ready to be productive. Be sure to plan for meal-prep time and eating so that you don’t find yourself plundering your cabinets in a mad rush for food an hour past mealtime. Planning meals and even snacks ahead of time makes it easier to eat mindfully and healthfully. Also, plan workouts into your schedule. It’s far too easy to spend the whole day at your desk—whether that desk is at the office or at home. Block out time for workouts ahead of time—even when those workouts are at home, and keep those appointments just as dutifully as you’d keep a customer or partner call. ""Invest in a good work environment. Whether you have a dedicated home office or are carving out space in a 600-foot apartment shared with roommates, it’s always worthwhile to invest in as good a home work environment as you’re able. Create a workspace that gives you joy, complete with nice décor and sufficient lighting, and make sure your chairs and table are set up well ergonomically. A strong Internet connection and good video-conferencing service will help you stay connected.”      Marianna Hewitt, Cofounder of Summer Fridays           Courtesy    “Have a morning routine. Sticking to a routine helps so much so that you wake up with purpose and a plan before jumping into work. My current routine includes drinking water, meditating, making my bed and showering. “Get dressed. When working from home, it is so easy to roll out of bed in your sweats and start tackling your inbox. For me, it helps to put on real clothes so I am in the mindset of being at the office. “Work from a table. I never bring my laptop into bed or work on my couch. If I am sitting upright at a dining table or kitchen counter, I work much more efficiently, because I am focused and not relaxed or lounging. “Give yourself a schedule. It is so easy to work, do laundry, watch TV. But treat working from home like you would an office. Give yourself a start time, lunch break, and ending time so that your work doesn’t creep into the late hours of the day. If you don’t give yourself a schedule, it can feel like work is taking over your life.”      Jennifer Bandier, Founder and CEO of Bandier           Courtesy Bandier    “In order to successfully work from home, you need to make sure (ahead of time) your work-from-home office is set up and prepared. This means: great Wi-Fi, great Wi-Fi, great Wi-Fi. Losing the face-to-face dynamic is the biggest challenge when working from home. To overcome this hurdle, Wi-Fi and utilizing video is necessary. Powering video conference is the major hack when trying to stay on top of meetings and communicating with others.”      Hanako Maeda, Founder and CEO of Adeam           Courtesy    “The health and well-being of my team and their families is the most important, so we have been working from home this week. While working from home, it’s been helpful to set alarms to indicate office hours and also give myself breaks for 12 p.m. lunchtime and 3 p.m. coffee breaks. It helps me to have breaks once in 3 to 4 hours to keep my productivity. We’ve also been having a lot of phone conferences and Skype meetings, which have been very useful. Also, I’ve been working out at home using hand weights and yoga mats, and doing a short exercise in the morning has helped me get an energy boost.”      Sarah Larson Levey, Founder and CEO of Y7 Studio           Griff Lipsom    “I have my most productive days when I get dressed. It’s obviously comfortable to be in sweats all day, but it does put me in a haze. I find by putting on clothes and sitting in more of a working environment versus a bed or couch allows me to get the most done.”      Priti Joshi, Vice President of Strategy for Bumble           Courtesy Bumble    “I’ve tried to dedicate a space in my home to work and a space to not work. I’m doing my best to honor this; when we are working and living in the same space, it’s too easy to let one or the other consume us (or feel torn in multiple directions). The number one thing for me: I never take my laptop into my bedroom! “Take time for all the emotions. Physically distancing from others is hard, and it’s okay to let yourself acknowledge that. I’m making it a point to FaceTime my family, friends, and loved ones—even more than I normally would. While we can’t all be there for each other physically, we can virtually. That is what matters. “I’m also remembering to motivate our team. Keep in mind that anyone who entered the workforce in the last 10 years has never experienced an economic climate like today’s. To help support the team, we’re creating a new weekly tradition: virtual happy hours on Thursday afternoons. Partners, pets, and children are welcome, and my hope is we can catch up on the latest Netflix binge or recipe we’re trying out to help all of us stay positive together in this challenging time!”      Jackie Aina, YouTube Star and Beauty Icon           Brandon Lundby    “Now is a good time to start organizing things—your bathroom, vanity, space in your home—places that you get the most work done. For me, if I reinvent a space periodically, I get re-inspired to get more work done. Also, working from home in intervals helps: When working from home, divide your tasks by working for one hour, and then taking a 15-minute break, and then an hour on again, and then 15 minutes off again until you’ve completed a task. That way, you can prevent being easily distracted or starting things without finishing them.”      Sarah Lee and Christine Chang, Cofounders of Glow Recipe           Courtesy GlowRecipe    SL: “When I’m working from home, it’s all about maximizing my work output while multitasking a bunch of things at once. Our schedules are always jam-packed that sometimes I will even take conference calls with a mask on while I’m taking a bath. For the times during the day that I’m glued to a seat, I keep a facial mist near me at all times to give myself a quick refresh and pick-me-up.” CC: “When working at home, I love to multitask by masking or sheet-masking at my desk while I’m working. I also get inspired with fresh ideas when I’m on the move, so I like to take conference calls while walking around the block near home to get in some exercise and fresh air.”      Deepica Mutyala, Cofounder and CEO of Live Tinted           Courtesy Live Tinted    “I wake up and do 10 minutes of Headspace every morning, it really sets me up for the day. I’m also discovering new ways to do at-home workouts. My friend Louise Hazel has created a #slaychallenge on her app that makes working out from home super easy. As for communication, using Google Hangouts is helping us all stay connected and continue our meetings as regularly scheduled.”      Laure Hériard Dubreuil, CEO and founder of The Webster           Camilo Rios    ""Schedule and structure are what keep me on track when working from home! Especially since I moved to L.A., I still start my day around 5:30-6 a.m. so that I am aligned with our operations on the East Coast. Keeping a schedule for children is also so important during this time when they are home so that their lives feel consistent and somewhat normal! ""I always change into clothes that I would normally wear to work; this helps me stay in the right focus mindset. I mainly work off my phone and always in the living room, never in the rooms like the kitchen or the bedroom because there has to be a form of separation. I am newly obsessed with the app Houseparty —it has brought a new feeling of joy being able to connect with my friends, family, and employees in such a light-hearted way.”      Rachna Shah, Partner, Managing Director PR and Digital at KCD           BFA    “Organization is key—organizing the day into small chunks to incorporate taking care of my kids, taking care of my team, and taking care of my clients.  I am trying to not multitask but find moments of focus for each area.  Plus, being grateful for my Peloton for some time to decompress!”      Bouchra Ezzahraoui and Sophie Kahn, Cofounders of AUrate           Courtesy Aurate    BE: “I always come up with a very clear and timed to-do list. For example, activities that need more focus will take the morning slots and my afternoons are usually calls or follow-ups on projects we already kicked off. The calls are kept short within 20 minutes with clear agendas sent ahead of time. A quick lunch, a 15-minute break with my twins, or a call to a loved one is part of the productivity boost midday.” SK: “To be productive, first and foremost, the basic necessities need to be met. I make sure I sleep enough (despite all the stress now), eat well and healthy, get some fresh air (even if it’s a walk around the block), and have time to give attention to my toddler in the morning and end of day. Then, for the work, it’s all about effective communication when the team is WFH. We have morning check-ins and digital meetings with the relevant teams so everybody knows the current status and their priorities, and then we are off to the races. Every day EOD, we check off where we stand, what we did, and what next steps are. It’s super structured and organized, that’s the key to make it efficient when the team is dispersed.”      Sharon Chuter, Founder of Uoma Beauty           Courtesy Uoma Beauty    “I am a HUGE fan of lists. I can spend an hour creating a very comprehensive to-do list. Everything goes on it, including to do the laundry. I find it gives me a very systematic process to go through and also fuels a sense of achievement at the end of the day. There is always so much for me to do, and the days can run away very quickly, so it is important that I am able to prioritize, as well as at the end of the day, see how much I have done in context of how much I did not get to. “I also am a huge thinker. So, I spend my alone time processing the things I need to do. For example, shower time is a great time for me to process my day and the things that I must get done. I prioritize in that moment the things I must achieve that day, that week, and how it leads to the big picture. I guess there really is an art of taking the biggest projects or goals, and breaking them into small parts with a clear idea of what step one really is. I find when I have a clear head and a clear idea of what I want to achieve in that time period, it keeps me focused and helps me remove all the noise when I get into my day, and it helps me execute with precision. It also helps me to manage things when they go off the rail, because I remember why I am doing what I am doing, and then prepare that the how may completely vary from what I originally intended.”      Lori Coulter and Reshma Chattaram Chamberlin, Cofounders of Summersalt           Courtesy Sumersalt    LC: “To keep teams and leadership on the same page when working remotely, it is important to over-communicate. Make sure you are having regular team huddles, that everyone knows what they are working on and the goal that you are all working toward together.” RCC: “My number one tip for how to stay productive while working from home is to establish a routine. It is very tempting to stay in your pajamas all day when you work from home. However, research shows that getting ready and dressed really helps with your disposition and productivity. I always get ready for the day the same way I would if I was going into the office.”      Kerry Pieri, Fashion and Features Director of BAZAAR.com           Courtesy Kerry Pieri    “I think it’s important to continue to structure your day when you work from home. Wake up, have your coffee or matcha, do you morning routine, get dressed even if it’s into something comfortable, do some yoga stretching, then get started with your workload. Of course, working online, it’s easy for me to be remote and produce content from anywhere. But market appointments and events are off the table for now. I just want to continue to support brands and retailers during this time, and provide some uplifting fun features for people who might be home and feeling isolated.”      Joyann King, Executive Editor of BAZAAR.com           Francesco Lagnese    “Multitasking with a toddler just doesn’t work, and, trust me, I have tried. Instead, I am trying to practice presence with the task at hand. Whether making breakfast and cleaning the kitchen, answering emails, FaceTiming with an editor, or taking a short walk to play at the swing set, I am dedicating my focus to that one singular need, and it is helping my stress levels and productivity immensely. Also, a little time to foam roll or sit in total silence is the best medicine for keeping focused.”      Erica Gonzales   Erica Gonzales is the Culture and Content Strategy Editor for BAZAAR.com, where she oversees news and culture coverage, including celebrity, music, TV, movies, and more.

https://nursingnotes.co.uk/nurse-week-dies-home-work/,"This week two nurses have lost their lives while driving home from work.

Kerrie Browne a 26-year-old nurse working at University Hospital Kerry in Tralee died in a road traffic collision yesterday morning.

It is understood she was on her way home after finishing her night shift when the accident occurred on the N21 at Meenleitrim, Castleisland.

Ms Browne studied and trained in London and worked for Whittington Health NHS Trust before returning to Ireland to be closer to family.

Local police said the fatal road traffic collision involving a jeep and a car occurred at around 8am. They are appealing for any witnesses to come forward, particularly any motorists who were travelling in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage.

The news comes only hours after the death of another young nurse Laurie Jones from Wales.

Tributes to both the young nurses have filled social media alongside calls for health services to take urgent action to ensure there are no more deaths. One registered nurse said; “Sometimes I am so tired I don’t remember how I get home”.

https://catlintucker.com/2020/03/3-ways-to-use-video-conferencing/,"Thank goodness for Zoom and Google Meet! During this time of social isolation and remote learning, these video conferencing tools are lifesavers. They make it possible for teachers to maintain a human connection with their students and guide their learning from a distance. Below are three suggestions for using these video conferencing platforms to continue teaching students as they learn remotely.

#1 Small Group Instruction

Teachers can host a series of short Zoom or Google Meet sessions throughout the day focused on different skills or topics. These online sessions are an excellent way to continue teaching and connecting with learners. Even if teachers cannot require that students attend a live meeting due to concerns around access, connectivity, and availability, these sessions can be recorded and posted on class websites, Google Classroom, or a learning management system.

As teachers think about hosting virtual meetings, I would encourage them to approach the design of this time with intention. Structuring a small group instruction session will help to engage students and make the experience more meaningful for them. It is essential to build in time for them to discuss information and ask questions.

If teachers are planning to use video conference to simply transfer information (e.g., lectures or mini-lessons), I would suggest recording a video and allowing students to self-pace through that video. Then the valuable and limited time you have with students in a video conferencing session can be spent on more hands-on, collaborative, and engaging tasks.

#2 Facilitate a Small Group Discussion

Teachers can invite students to participate in a small group discussion about a chapter they read in a text or the textbook, debrief about a flipped video lesson, or unpack complex issues or topics related to your subject area.

Ideally, I would suggest teachers provide the discussion questions ahead of time to allow students to think about them before the conversation. I also recommend providing students with an online space where they can crowdsource and capture questions they would like to discuss. Teachers can do this using Mentimeter by asking an open-ended question, on a shared online document, or simply asking students to write down three questions on paper that they can bring to the conversation.

#3 Conferencing with Students

Conferencing online with students about their goals, progress, questions, and concerns is a powerful way to use video conferencing capabilities. Teachers can create a schedule of timeslots using an online calendar, like Google Calendar or Calendy, to allow students to sign up for 5-minute conferencing sessions.

I am a fan of using a goal-setting activity to guide conferencing sessions about student progress. In the past, I have used the SMART goal format to get students thinking about what they want to achieve in a grading period; however, given the fluid nature of the COVID-19 and school closures, I would encourage teachers to embrace goal-setting on a smaller scale (e.g., one week at a time).

I adapted Simon Sinek’s golden circle from his book Start with Why to get students thinking about why they want to achieve a particular goal (academic or personal), how they will go about achieving it, and what success will look or feel like.

Teachers can make a copy of the Google Drawing above and share it with students via Google Classroom. This goal-setting activity engages students in the metacognitive practice of setting a personal or academic goal at the start of each week. Then teachers can reference this goal during conferencing sessions. They can also end each week by asking students to reflect on their progress toward their goal that week in a journal or online reflective log.

Optional video conferencing sessions can offer students an avenue to connect and get the support they need during this tough time. I have also heard teachers on Twitter talk about offering parent Q&A sessions or coffee chats with families to keep them in the loop and lower anxiety levels. Other teachers are meeting with their professional learning communities (PLCs) to discuss lesson design, book study texts or education podcasts, or simply share what is working as they move curriculum online.

There are myriad ways to leverage video conferencing during this time of social isolation and remote learning. If you are using video conferencing with students, teachers, or families and want to share your approach, please take a moment to post a comment so we can learn from each other!","Xa����ώBl�d��Xղ�~��ǁ>�\�Wm�dg�""�_�ھ����j�Ԛvq߬�������uØSX?p��wVY�>�0�ճ��ԍ��_���\������V�x5�c.�,ވ������FLV�x""/�6�v�w�3�:��}+�L�{�

https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-are-some-kids-thriving-during-remote-learning,"But reconnecting months later during the coronavirus closures, Woodard shared some surprising news: the same boy was “thriving” during remote learning. “I think not having those everyday distractions in school has really allowed for kids like him to focus on the work and not necessarily all the social things going on because some kids can't separate that out,” said Woodard, who teaches in Washington, D.C.

All school year, Montenique Woodard’s seventh period, her last class of the day, has been her hardest. “I feel like I don't know what to do with them,” she said of her middle school science class when Edutopia first talked to her back in the fall. One boy in particular, the “class clown,” was a persistent challenge, and his behavior influenced his 23 peers, 15 of whom are boys.

“I think a few of mine are doing really well getting a taste of more independence,” said Lauren Huddleston, a middle school English teacher in Memphis, Tennessee. “They’re taking ownership a bit more because they’re no longer under the micromanagement of the school day.”

On average, the typical high school student starts school at 8:00 a.m . While school schedules differ by district, many students then face back-to-back classes with little reprieve. But during the pandemic, school schedules have suddenly become more fluid, allowing students more choice over when and how they do their school work.

But it’s not a tiny handful, either, and the unplanned break from the physical classroom may be bringing to light hidden reasons some kids struggle while others succeed. In the responses we gathered from our educators, we found recurring themes—like social situations and the inflexible bell schedule—that simply don’t work well for all kids. For a few of the teachers, at least, it’s inspired them to consider making permanent changes when they return to the classroom.

That’s not to say it’s the norm. Many students are struggling to adapt to remote learning: Digital access and connectivity remain a pervasive equity issue; stay-at-home orders have magnified existing problems in familial dynamics; and, universally, teachers and students grapple with how to replicate the engagement and discourse from an in-person classroom.

We’ve been hearing that a lot. Increasingly, teachers in our audience are reporting that a handful of their students—shy kids, hyperactive kids, highly creative kids—are suddenly doing better with remote learning than they were doing in the physical classroom. “It’s been awesome to see some of my kids finally find their niche in education,” said Holli Ross, a first-year high school teacher in northern California, echoing the sentiments of dozens of teachers we’ve heard from.

This flexibility to make their own hours is also giving students a chance to exercise, take breaks, or even be bored, all of which research shows is beneficial. High school English teacher Ashlee Tripp speculated these kids were doing well because, “they enjoy the freedom to work at their own pace and decide how they want their day to look,” and students seem to agree.

“The reason I enjoy online learning is because of the opportunity to structure my day efficiently,” wrote a 10th grade student in English teacher Katie Burrows-Stone’s class survey. “I am able to workout, relax, and complete the work in a timely manner, with no distractions.”

Time to Rethink the Overextended Kid

During the school day, many students remain constantly on the go. Lunches are often filled with club meetings. After school, many participate in extracurriculars or sports—often to impress colleges—or work a part-time job. On average, high school students spend a minimum of seven and a half hours a week on homework at night.

After enrichment activities were canceled due to shelter-in-place orders, our teachers say they also saw a difference in some students’ performance.

“For my students, there are some that are thriving. I think it is partly because so many things like sports and social activities are no longer happening and they have more time than they ever had to work on school work,” said Kasey Short, a middle school English and social studies teacher in Charlotte, North Carolina, by way of explanation.

Research has found jam-packed schedules can be a significant challenge for a child to juggle: Students who are over-committed, especially if they feel obligated to take certain courses or participate in activities, are more likely to experience unhealthy anxiety levels.

“This has given me so much pause about what we are doing in education: Is our current model way too much? Why would anyone need to have seven classes? Why does the school day need to be so long?"" said Rosie Reid, a high school English teacher and the 2019 California Teacher of the Year. “I can't say enough about how this closure has changed my entire approach to teaching because I see how it has been an amazing respite for so many students.”

Lowering the Stakes

Other teachers point to the changing academic expectations during the pandemic as a causal link. Given the structure of home learning—and pervasive equity issues—many school systems have encouraged teachers to be more lenient with coursework and grading.

“I think a huge part of [some students’ work improving] is that we’ve dramatically ratcheted down the total workload in order to make tasks accessible rather than overwhelming,” said Mark Gardner, high school English teacher in Camas, Washington.

According to a Pew Research Center study, teens cite academic pressure as the top pressure they face, with 61 percent of teens reporting they feel the heat to achieve at a certain level academically. Teachers too, have also been under increasing scrutiny in the last decade-plus to prepare students to hit benchmarks on standardized testing, pressure that trickles down to students, who are twice as likely to report unhealthy levels of stress during the school year compared to the summer.

“One student told me he likes remote learning better because he no longer feels the extreme pressure of failing,” said Cathleen Beachboard, a middle school English teacher in Fauquier County, Virginia, who says other students in her class have expressed similar sentiments. “He says that now that the pressure of state testing is off, he feels he can really learn.”

Reducing the Chatter

Though we’ve seen many comments—from both students and teachers—about missing the in-person connections and relationships at school, for some students, school socialization may be fraught with anxiety, our teachers suggest.

“Students who have been victims of physical or verbal bullying while at school are likely to be relieved to be home in a safe space,” said Elena Spathis, high school Spanish teacher in Hillsdale, New Jersey.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2017, at least 20 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school. Students who are the most bullied have also been found to have lower academic performance than their non-bullied peers.

For other students, socialization at school may not be negative per se, just distracting or intimidating. Nearly a third of teens have reported feeling pressure to “look good” or “fit in socially” at school, which can influence their participation and focus in class. “The online environment may allow for voices to be heard without the added bit of social anxiety,” said Blake Harvard, a psychology teacher in Madison, Alabama.

Getting Enough Z's

Lastly, teachers commented that the difference they’ve observed in some students’ performance may be tied, simply, to sleep. Like many teachers—and workers across the country—most students are no longer waking up to a very early alarm clock.

“I have the time to sleep eight hours a night every night [now],” said Ingrid, a high school junior in California, when asked what she likes about remote learning.

While the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 8-10 hours a night for teens ages 12-18 and 12 hours for children ages 6-12, a 2018 study of high school students across 30 states found more than 70 percent of students were not getting enough sleep during the school year.

Though the long-standing debate over school start times never seems to end, when the Seattle school district delayed school start times by an hour at one school in 2016-2017, researchers found students’ sleep increased and grades improved.

“There are kids who have a hard time getting to class at 8:30, but they might do really well getting their work done at 10:30 at night or even 10:30 in the morning. They just need a couple extra hours,” said Ross.

Though remote learning has brought many challenges, some students seem to be thriving in the new circumstances. What can we learn from them?

Increasingly, teachers in our audience are reporting that a handful of their students—shy kids, hyperactive kids, highly creative kids—are suddenly doing better with remote learning than they were doing in the physical classroom. “It’s been awesome to see some of my kids finally find their niche in education,” said Holli Ross, a first-year high school teacher in northern California, echoing the sentiments of dozens of teachers we’ve heard from.  That’s not to say it’s the norm. Many students are struggling to adapt to remote learning: Digital access and connectivity remain a pervasive equity issue; stay-at-home orders have magnified existing problems in familial dynamics; and, universally, teachers and students grapple with how to replicate the engagement and discourse from an in-person classroom.  But it’s not a tiny handful, either, and the unplanned break from the physical classroom may be bringing to light  hidden reasons some kids struggle while others succeed. In the responses we gathered from our educators, we found recurring themes—like social situations and the inflexible  bell schedule—that simply don’t work well for all kids. For a few of the teachers, at least, it’s inspired them to consider making permanent changes when they return to the classroom.  The Benefits of Self-Pacing  On average, the typical high school student starts school at 8:00 a.m . While school schedules differ by district, many students then face back-to-back classes with little reprieve. But during the pandemic, school schedules have suddenly become more fluid, allowing students more choice over when and how they do their school work.  “I think a few of mine are doing really well getting a taste of more independence,” said Lauren Huddleston, a middle school English teacher in Memphis, Tennessee. “They’re taking ownership a bit more because they’re no longer under the micromanagement of the school day.”  This flexibility to make their own hours is also giving students a chance to exercise, take breaks, or even be bored, all of which research shows is beneficial . High school English teacher Ashlee Tripp speculated these kids were doing well because, “they enjoy the freedom to work at their own pace and decide how they want their day to look,” and students seem to agree.  “The reason I enjoy online learning is because of the opportunity to structure my day efficiently,” wrote a 10th grade student in English teacher Katie Burrows-Stone’s class survey. “I am able to workout, relax, and complete the work in a timely manner, with no distractions.”  Time to Rethink the Overextended Kid  During the school day, many students remain constantly on the go. Lunches are often filled with club meetings. After school, many participate in extracurriculars or sports—often to impress colleges —or work a part-time job. On average, high school students spend a minimum of seven and a half hours a week on homework at night.  After enrichment activities were canceled due to shelter-in-place orders, our teachers say they also saw a difference in some students’ performance.  “For my students, there are some that are thriving. I think it is partly because so many things like sports and social activities are no longer happening and they have more time than they ever had to work on school work,” said Kasey Short, a middle school English and social studies teacher in Charlotte, North Carolina, by way of explanation.  Research has found jam-packed schedules can be a significant challenge for a child to juggle: Students who are over-committed, especially if they feel obligated to take certain courses or participate in activities, are more likely to experience unhealthy anxiety levels .  “This has given me so much pause about what we are doing in education: Is our current model way too much? Why would anyone need to have seven classes? Why does the school day need to be so long?"" said Rosie Reid, a high school English teacher and the 2019 California Teacher of the Year. “I can't say enough about how this closure has changed my entire approach to teaching because I see how it has been an amazing respite for so many students.”  Lowering the Stakes  Other teachers point to the changing academic expectations during the pandemic as a causal link. Given the structure of home learning—and pervasive equity issues—many school systems have encouraged teachers to be more lenient with coursework and grading.  “I think a huge part of [some students’ work improving] is that we’ve dramatically ratcheted down the total workload in order to make tasks accessible rather than overwhelming,” said Mark Gardner, high school English teacher in Camas, Washington.  According to a Pew Research Center study , teens cite academic pressure as the top pressure they face, with 61 percent of teens reporting they feel the heat to achieve at a certain level academically. Teachers too, have also been under increasing scrutiny in the last decade-plus to prepare students to hit benchmarks on standardized testing, pressure that trickles down to students , who are twice as likely to report unhealthy levels of stress during the school year compared to the summer.  “One student told me he likes remote learning better because he no longer feels the extreme pressure of failing,” said Cathleen Beachboard, a middle school English teacher in Fauquier County, Virginia, who says other students in her class have expressed similar sentiments. “He says that now that the pressure of state testing is off, he feels he can really learn.”  Reducing the Chatter  Though we’ve seen many comments—from both students and teachers—about missing the in-person connections and relationships at school, for some students, school socialization may be fraught with anxiety, our teachers suggest.  “Students who have been victims of physical or verbal bullying while at school are likely to be relieved to be home in a safe space,” said Elena Spathis, high school Spanish teacher in Hillsdale, New Jersey.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2017, at least 20 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school. Students who are the most bullied have also been found to have lower academic performance than their non-bullied peers.  For other students, socialization at school may not be negative per se, just distracting or intimidating. Nearly a third of teens have reported feeling pressure to “look good” or “fit in socially” at school, which can influence their participation and focus in class. “The online environment may allow for voices to be heard without the added bit of social anxiety,” said Blake Harvard, a psychology teacher in Madison, Alabama.  Getting Enough Z's  Lastly, teachers commented that the difference they’ve observed in some students’ performance may be tied, simply, to sleep. Like many teachers—and workers across the country—most students are no longer waking up to a very early alarm clock.  “I have the time to sleep eight hours a night every night [now],” said Ingrid, a high school junior in California, when asked what she likes about remote learning.  While the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 8-10 hours a night for teens ages 12-18 and 12 hours for children ages 6-12, a 2018 study of high school students across 30 states found more than 70 percent of students were not getting enough sleep during the school year.  Though the long-standing debate over school start times never seems to end, when the Seattle school district delayed school start times by an hour at one school in 2016-2017, researchers found students’ sleep increased and grades improved.  “There are kids who have a hard time getting to class at 8:30, but they might do really well getting their work done at 10:30 at night or even 10:30 in the morning. They just need a couple extra hours,” said Ross.  Youki Terada contributed research insights to this article.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-online-education-resources/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-online-education-resources-for-home-education,"We have brought together a list of online educational resources to support children’s education at home while they may not be attending their normal education setting.

The lists include subject-specific resources for: English

maths

science

PE

wellbeing

special educational needs and disability ( SEND )

These resources are currently being offered for free.

Individual resources cannot replace a school’s properly planned curriculum, and the resources in this list are not intended to do so. Schools may wish to explore this list of resources as they consider how they continue to support children’s education.

We have assessed these resources with the support of subject experts to make sure they are:

high quality

appropriate for the students they are aimed at

The resources were also assessed against certain technical elements.

The resources may be useful for parents in considering how they could support their children’s education, but they should not be used in place of existing resources which schools may be using as part of their continued provision for pupils’ education at this time.

We have included some supporting home education tips for parents to help you during this challenging time.

This list of resources is not exhaustive and there are many other resources available to schools. This list has been updated since it was originally published to include additional resources suppliers have submitted to us.

Before using these resources, you should refer to the guidance on safeguarding in schools, colleges and other providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which has further information on how to keep children safe online.

Care should be taken that all activities, especially practical and physical activities, are undertaken safely and with due regard for the abilities of the pupil.

Teachers and parents/carers should check that activities are appropriate for the intended user and that they can be carried out safely in the home environment.","       Skip to main content         Tell us whether you accept cookies  We use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-major-package-to-support-online-learning,"Disadvantaged children across England are set to receive laptops and tablets as part of a push to make remote education accessible for pupils staying at home during the coronavirus outbreak.

Devices will be ordered for children in the most vital stages of their education, those who receive support from a social worker and care leavers.

The government will also provide 4G routers to make sure disadvantaged secondary school pupils and care leavers can access the internet – where those families do not already have mobile or broadband internet in the household.

The country’s major telecommunications providers will make it easier for families to access selected educational resources by temporarily exempting these sites from data charges.

In addition, to support the hard work of schools in delivering remote education, the Oak National Academy is due to launch on Monday 20 April. This brand-new enterprise has been created by 40 teachers from some of the leading schools across England, backed by government grant funding. It will provide 180 video lessons each week, across a broad range of subjects from maths to art to languages, for every year group from Reception through to Year 10.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said:

I want to thank all the teachers and staff who are working so hard to ensure vulnerable children and those of critical workers are supported at this time. Schools will remain closed until the scientific advice changes, which is why we need to support the incredible work teachers are already doing to ensure children continue to receive the education they deserve and need. By providing young people with these laptops and tablets and enabling schools to access high quality support, we will enable all children to continue learning now and in the years to come. We hope this support will take some of the pressure off both parents and schools by providing more materials for them to use.

Schools and colleges will be able to keep their laptops and tablets once they have reopened. This means that they will play a crucial role in enabling children to learn while schools and colleges are closed, and will also continue helping children learn in the future.

Oak Academy joins a broad range of support and resources available for schools and parents. This includes a list of high quality resources recently published by the Government, as well as the existing tools and resources schools use to provide remote education. Many suppliers are making resources, both online and hard-copy, available to schools for free.

This week (Monday 20 April) the BBC is launching its own education package across TV and online, featuring celebrities and some of the best teachers – helping to keep children learning and supporting parents.

This is alongside new guidance published today (Sunday 19 April) for parents on how best to support their child’s education and development.

While families stay at home to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, some children and young people may face increased risk of abuse or neglect at home - or from strangers online.

The Government will make funding worth £1.6 million available immediately for the NSPCC to expand and promote its national helpline for adults.

While schools and social workers remain at the forefront of work to protect vulnerable children, including by supporting them to attend school, expanding the NSPCC Helpline will mean many more adults know how and where to raise concerns and seek advice or support about the safety and wellbeing of any children they are worried about.","       Skip to main content         Tell us whether you accept cookies  We use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.

https://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/11545,"Not only have educators been inundated with information on COVID-19, but they have had to retool, refocus, and rethink completely how they are going to connect with and teach their students. A lot is going on in our world right now, and my first instinct is that we need to slow down and focus on what is most important at this moment.

My good friend Michelle Baldwin provides a critical perspective on the importance of hitting the “pause” button:

I have been thinking about how best I can support others in this time. Part of my “pause” is thinking about the importance of how do we get better moving forward because of this situation. I went back to this quote I shared in “Innovate Inside the Box” from Donna Volpitta, EdD, founder of the Center for Resilient Leadership:

Today, resilience has a much broader meaning. For researchers and professionals working with kids, it’s not just about “bouncing back.” It’s about “bouncing forward.” Resilience doesn’t just mean getting back to normal after facing a difficult situation. It means learning from the process in order to become stronger and better at tackling the next challenge.

In Katie Martin’s latest post, she acknowledges the importance of recognizing that although “each teacher, school district, family, child, and community has its opportunities and challenges,” we also have an opportunity to create something compelling in education at this moment in time:

“I keep thinking necessity is the mother of all invention and this is the time to invent new structures, tear down ineffective ones and awaken hidden talents and passions in our children. Let’s think about how we can focus on connection and learning instead of recreating ineffective structures and routines of school that breed isolation and disengagement at home. Let’s not focus on how to cover it all remotely when we would have probably been spending the month (or more) prepping and taking tests anyway. Instead, could we see it as an opportunity to focus on what learners need and what they want to learn instead of what is in the pacing guide or will be would have been on the test, especially since they probably won’t remember it anyway?”

What I see moving forward is that people will start viewing what is essential in education, which is what the majority of educators have been advocating for since I started in the profession. There is more of a focus from the general public on the importance of creating meaning right now rather than solely focusing on what can be measured.

So as we temporarily move the majority of education in the world to these online spaces, there are two things to consider, that almost seems counterintuitive.

One is that you can’t just move “face-to-face” learning to online spaces. John Spencer reiterates this in his post “7 Big Ideas as You Shift Toward Online Teaching.”

One of the most common questions people asked me was, “How do I convert my face-to-face course into an online course?” The truth is, you can’t convert it. Learning isn’t like a file that converts between a .doc and a PDF and a Google Doc. We can’t simply substitute new tools and do the same exact activity.

The second consideration is that although our “teaching” may not look the same, the principles and focus on what is essential, should stay consistent. In “Innovate Inside the Box,” I identified the “Core of Innovative Teaching and Learning,” and these ideas hold in any educational setting.

I would like to share some thoughts on each principle and some ideas for how they apply to an online environment. As Katie mentioned, everyone’s context is different, and I am hoping to provide these ideas for discussion. Still, ultimately, you have to figure out what works best for your unique situation.

1. Focus on Relationships

Although it is harder to “connect” in an online space, right now, it is more important than ever, that is where we start with our focus. For most students right now, “school” is the least of their concerns, or their family’s.

In this one minute video from Joe Sanfelippo, he shares these two crucial questions to start every day;

How are you doing? Do you need anything?

LEADERS!!! In a time of uncertainty let’s make sure we are CONSISTENT and CONNECTED for those we serve. The 2 best questions to start the day are…HOW ARE YOU DOING? DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?#LeadFromWhereYouAre #1minwalk2work #ImpactTheNarrative #HackingLeadership pic.twitter.com/cfi5c0nuCB — Joe Sanfelippo (@Joe_Sanfelippo) March 21, 2020

The idea is no different than greeting kids at the door in the morning to check in how they are doing, only the delivery.

A simple thing I did with my weekly GIF Friday question, was to just check in on people to see how they were doing and asked them to respond in GIF form. It provided an opportunity for people to share something funny and take a step back.

Every morning since we have been “social distancing,” I have been posting funny or warm videos to help people start the day. They might not provide much “educational value,” but they can have an impact on learning.

Check-in on your people early and often. (Do not limit that to students; staff and our communities need that as well. Allyson Apsey wrote this great post on team and community check-ins.)

2. Focus on Creating Empowering Learning Experiences.

Here is a simple shift to consider right now in online environments. Are you focused more on your teaching or their learning? The two are intertwined, but when we shift our thinking to first focus on what our students will learn, it is more about what they will create through their learning. I have witnessed people wondering how they are going to “teach” for hours on end in an online environment. No one will be able to lecture for massive lengths of time and is probably the reason why Ted Talks are limited to twenty minutes.

Can we share small portions of information, that can be delivered in synchronous or asynchronous formats, and have students spend the majority of their time doing meaningful creation (to them) to share their learning? Videos, podcasts, or any type of media that students can create to show their knowledge, in my opinion, will provide for much more in-depth learning than merely consuming information.

My assumption here, of course, is that if students are doing online courses, they have access to technology. I know this is not always the case, or it can be minimal. This is why we must embrace flexibility while also doing our best to figure out solutions to support our communities. In a conversation with one district leader, she shared that their school community had focused on providing not only devices but WiFi to ensure access to all students during this time. I appreciated her focus on creating opportunities for all students at the highest levels.

Households with limited technology might not be able to complete or do something on the same timeline as others. We also have to be considerate that some homes will have no access to technology to kids during the day, which is why it is crucial to check-in and understand what supports our school communities can provide.

The more we can have our students creating, reflecting, and connecting their learning, the better. Content is still valuable, but the more we can empower our students to create their learning, the better.

Are you focused more on “doing school” or “learning”?

3. Focus on Learner-Driven, Evidence-Informed Practice.

It is easier to identify what we don’t have, as opposed to what we do. This is true of our situations and in those that we serve.

Now, more than ever, we must identify what our students bring to the table and the strengths they have.

Have time to connect with your students and figure out what works best for them to highlight their strengths. This will be beneficial beyond school.

The reason that “evidence-informed” practice is important is to understand that students can share their learning and provide evidence in multiple ways. If we are going to highlight and tap into strengths, we cannot standardize assessments.

The questions below can be modified easily to support an online environment. Please feel free to use them, remix, and change, how you see fit.

4. Focus on Educator as a Learner First, Teacher Second

I have heard the words “unprecedented times” more in the past few weeks than I have heard in my lifetime. There is a lot of uncertainty and doubt right now, while there is an expectation of changing everything immediately. We need to slow down.

Referring back to Michelle Baldwin’s earlier tweet, the “pause” is essential right now. It is not feasible to say, “we will be back in a few months” with a program. That is not what I am saying at all because it is not realistic for many communities. What I am saying is that educators don’t need to do everything right now, and our focus should be more on the experience of online learning through the perspective of our learners first.

This is a question that I often ask; are we jumping straight to the teaching without doing the learning?

As educators, can we ask our students to share some reflections on their learning in meaningful ways, while also doing the same? Starting a vlog or blog right now could not only be valuable to grow as a learner but to have a better understanding of the potential impact it can have on student learning, and how we can make it better.

With a focus on learning first, we not only become more empathetic to the struggles of our students, we learn how we can grow through the process. We can go through it or grow through it. Embracing the role of being a learner first can ultimately lead to becoming a much better educator.

The ideas I shared above are important in teaching online or face-to-face. The strategies might change but what truly matters and is important should stay the same. I also love this advice from Rich Kiker:

As you dive into #remotelearning don’t toss the best “bricks & clicks” strategies that you used in your classroom. Be intentional about having students draw, journal, brainstorm, etc. offline to keep engagement high & learning varied. #KikerLearning #edchat #edtech #blendedbites pic.twitter.com/pyxkNZw6Yb — Rich Kiker (@rkiker) March 23, 2020

The reason I have provided these thoughts is because a) I want to give some ideas to support and hopefully spark some conversation, and b) taking the time to reflect and connect my learning provides me some purpose and meaning each day.

For any or all of these ideas to be successful, one thing matters more than anything else—your health and well-being. There is so much going on in our world, and if we do not take care of ourselves, it will be impossible to help others effectively.

Please take care of yourself.","                                                          Books and Courses #PodcastPD The Innovator’s Mindset Introduction Chapter 1: What Innovation Is and Isn’t Chapter 2: The Innovator’s Mindset Chapter 3: Characteristics of the Innovator’s Mindset Chapter 4: Relationships, Relationships, Relationships Chapter 5: Learn, Lead, Innovate Chapter 6: Engage Versus Empower Chapter 7: Creating a Shared Vision Chapter 8: Strengths-Based Leadership Chapter 9: Powerful Learning First, Technology Second Chapter 10: Less Is More Chapter 11: Embracing an Open Culture Chapter 12: Create Meaningful Learning Experiences for Educators Chapter 13: Are We There Yet?

https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/3/the-difference-between-emergency-remote-teaching-and-online-learning,"Well-planned online learning experiences are meaningfully different from courses offered online in response to a crisis or disaster. Colleges and universities working to maintain instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic should understand those differences when evaluating this emergency remote teaching.

Credit: frankie's / Shutterstock.com © 2020

Due to the threat of COVID-19, colleges and universities are facing decisions about how to continue teaching and learning while keeping their faculty, staff, and students safe from a public health emergency that is moving fast and not well understood. Many institutions have opted to cancel all face-to-face classes, including labs and other learning experiences, and have mandated that faculty move their courses online to help prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. The list of institutions of higher education making this decision has been growing each day. Institutions of all sizes and types—state colleges and universities, Ivy League institutions, community colleges, and others—are moving their classes online.1 Bryan Alexander has curated the status of hundreds of institutions.2

Moving instruction online can enable the flexibility of teaching and learning anywhere, anytime, but the speed with which this move to online instruction is expected to happen is unprecedented and staggering. Although campus support personnel and teams are usually available to help faculty members learn about and implement online learning, these teams typically support a small pool of faculty interested in teaching online. In the present situation, these individuals and teams will not be able to offer the same level of support to all faculty in such a narrow preparation window. Faculty might feel like instructional MacGyvers, having to improvise quick solutions in less-than-ideal circumstances. No matter how clever a solution might be—and some very clever solutions are emerging—many instructors will understandably find this process stressful.

The temptation to compare online learning to face-to-face instruction in these circumstances will be great. In fact, an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education has already called for a ""grand experiment"" doing exactly that.3 This is a highly problematic suggestion, however. First and foremost, the politics of any such debate must be acknowledged. ""Online learning"" will become a politicized term that can take on any number of meanings depending on the argument someone wants to advance. In talking about lessons learned when institutions moved classes online during a shutdown in South Africa, Laura Czerniewicz starts with this very lesson and what happened around the construct of ""blended learning"" at the time.4 The idea of blended learning was drawn into political agendas without paying sufficient attention to the fact that institutions would make different decisions and invest differently, resulting in widely varying solutions and results from one institution to another. With some of that hindsight as wisdom, we seek to advance some careful distinctions that we hope can inform the evaluations and reflections that will surely result from this mass move by colleges and universities.

Online learning carries a stigma of being lower quality than face-to-face learning, despite research showing otherwise. These hurried moves online by so many institutions at once could seal the perception of online learning as a weak option, when in truth nobody making the transition to online teaching under these circumstances will truly be designing to take full advantage of the affordances and possibilities of the online format.

Researchers in educational technology, specifically in the subdiscipline of online and distance learning, have carefully defined terms over the years to distinguish between the highly variable design solutions that have been developed and implemented: distance learning, distributed learning, blended learning, online learning, mobile learning, and others. Yet an understanding of the important differences has mostly not diffused beyond the insular world of educational technology and instructional design researchers and professionals. Here, we want to offer an important discussion around the terminology and formally propose a specific term for the type of instruction being delivered in these pressing circumstances: emergency remote teaching.

Many active members of the academic community, including some of us, have been hotly debating the terminology in social media, and ""emergency remote teaching"" has emerged as a common alternative term used by online education researchers and professional practitioners to draw a clear contrast with what many of us know as high-quality online education. Some readers may take issue with the use of the term ""teaching"" over choices such as ""learning"" or ""instruction."" Rather than debating all of the details of those concepts, we selected ""teaching"" because of its simple definitions—""the act, practice, or profession of a teacher""5 and ""the concerted sharing of knowledge and experience,""6—along with the fact that the first tasks undertaken during emergency changes in delivery mode are those of a teacher/instructor/professor.

Effective Online Education

Online education, including online teaching and learning, has been studied for decades. Numerous research studies, theories, models, standards, and evaluation criteria focus on quality online learning, online teaching, and online course design. What we know from research is that effective online learning results from careful instructional design and planning, using a systematic model for design and development.7 The design process and the careful consideration of different design decisions have an impact on the quality of the instruction. And it is this careful design process that will be absent in most cases in these emergency shifts.

One of the most comprehensive summaries of research on online learning comes from the book Learning Online: What Research Tells Us about Whether, When and How.8 The authors identify nine dimensions, each of which has numerous options, highlighting the complexity of the design and decision-making process. The nine dimensions are modality, pacing, student-instructor ratio, pedagogy, instructor role online, student role online, online communication synchrony, role of online assessments, and source of feedback (see ""Online learning design options"").

Online learning design options (moderating variables) Modality Fully online Blended (over 50% online) Blended (25–50% online) Web-enabled F2F Pacing Self-paced (open entry, open exit) Class-paced Class-paced with some self-paced Student-Instructor Ratio < 35 to 1 36–99 to 1 100–999 to 1 > 1,000 to 1 Pedagogy Expository Practice Exploratory Collaborative Role of Online Assessments Determine if student is ready for new content Tell system how to support the student (adaptive instruction) Provide student or teacher with information about learning state Input to grade Identify students at risk of failure

Within each of these dimensions, there are options. Complicating matters, not all of the options are equally effective. For example, decisions around class size will greatly constrain what strategies you can use. Practice and feedback, for example, are well established in the literature, but it's harder to implement this as class size grows, eventually reaching a point where it's just not possible for an instructor to provide quality feedback. In the case of synchrony, what you choose will really depend on your learners' characteristics and what best meets their needs (adult learners require more flexibility, so asynchronous is usually best, perhaps with optional synchronous sessions, whereas younger learners benefit from the structure of required synchronous sessions).

Research on types of interaction—which includes student–content, student–student, and student–learner—is one of the more robust bodies of research in online learning. In short, it shows that the presence of each of these types of interaction, when meaningfully integrated, increases the learning outcomes.9 Thus, careful planning for online learning includes not just identifying the content to cover but also carefully tending to how you're going to support different types of interactions that are important to the learning process. This approach recognizes learning as both a social and a cognitive process, not merely a matter of information transmission.

Those who have built online programs over the years will attest that effective online learning aims to be a learning community and supports learners not just instructionally but with co-curricular engagement and other social supports. Consider how much infrastructure exists around face-to-face education that supports student success: library resources, housing, career services, health services, and so on. Face-to-face education isn't successful because lecturing is good. Lectures are one instructional aspect of an overall ecosystem specifically designed to support learners with formal, informal, and social resources. Ultimately, effective online education requires an investment in an ecosystem of learner supports, which take time to identify and build. Relative to other options, simple online content delivery can be quick and inexpensive, but confusing that with robust online education is akin to confusing lectures with the totality of residential education.

Typical planning, preparation, and development time for a fully online university course is six to nine months before the course is delivered. Faculty are usually more comfortable teaching online by the second or third iteration of their online courses. It will be impossible for every faculty member to suddenly become an expert in online teaching and learning in this current situation, in which lead times range from a single day to a few weeks. While there are resources to which faculty can turn for assistance, the scale of change currently being required on many campuses will stress the systems that provide those resources and most likely will surpass their capacities. Let's face it: many of the online learning experiences that instructors will be able to offer their students will not be fully featured or necessarily well planned, and there's a high probability for suboptimal implementation. We need to recognize that everyone will be doing the best they can, trying to take just the essentials with them as they make a mad dash during the emergency. Thus, the distinction is important between the normal, everyday type of effective online instruction and that which we are doing in a hurry with bare minimum resources and scant time: emergency remote teaching.

Emergency Remote Teaching

In contrast to experiences that are planned from the beginning and designed to be online, emergency remote teaching (ERT) is a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery mode due to crisis circumstances. It involves the use of fully remote teaching solutions for instruction or education that would otherwise be delivered face-to-face or as blended or hybrid courses and that will return to that format once the crisis or emergency has abated. The primary objective in these circumstances is not to re-create a robust educational ecosystem but rather to provide temporary access to instruction and instructional supports in a manner that is quick to set up and is reliably available during an emergency or crisis. When we understand ERT in this manner, we can start to divorce it from ""online learning."" There are many examples of other countries responding to school and university closures in a time of crisis by implementing models such as mobile learning, radio, blended learning, or other solutions that are contextually more feasible. For example, in a study on education's role in fragility and emergency situations, the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies examined four case studies.10 One of those cases was Afghanistan, where education was disrupted by conflict and violence and schools themselves were targets, sometimes because girls were trying to access education. In order to take children off the streets and keep them safe, radio education and DVDs were used to maintain and expand educational access and also were aimed at promoting education for girls.

What becomes apparent as we examine examples of educational planning in crises is that these situations require creative problem solving. We have to be able to think outside standard boxes to generate various possible solutions that help meet the new needs for our learners and communities. In some cases, it might even help us generate some new solutions to intractable problems, such as the dangers girls faced trying to access education in Afghanistan. Thus, it may be tempting to think about ERT as a bare-bones approach to standard instruction. In reality, it is a way of thinking about delivery modes, methods, and media, specifically as they map to rapidly changing needs and limitations in resources, such as faculty support and training.11

In the present situation, the campus support teams that are usually available to help faculty members learn about and implement online learning will not be able to offer the same level of support to all faculty who need it. Faculty support teams play a critical role in the learning experiences of students by helping faculty members develop face-to-face or online learning experiences. Current support models might include full-course design support, professional development opportunities, content development, learning management system training and support, and multimedia creation in partnership with faculty experts. Faculty who seek support typically have varying levels of digital fluency and are often accustomed to one-on-one support when experimenting with online tools. The shift to ERT requires that faculty take more control of the course design, development, and implementation process. With the expectation of rapid development of online teaching and learning events and the large number of faculty in need of support, faculty development and support teams must find ways to meet the institutional need to provide instructional continuity while helping faculty develop skills to work and teach in an online environment. As such, institutions must rethink the way instructional support units do their work, at least during a crisis.

The rapid approach necessary for ERT may diminish the quality of the courses delivered. A full-course development project can take months when done properly. The need to ""just get it online"" is in direct contradiction to the time and effort normally dedicated to developing a quality course. Online courses created in this way should not be mistaken for long-term solutions but accepted as a temporary solution to an immediate problem. Especially concerning is the degree to which the accessibility of learning materials might not be addressed during ERT. This is but one reason that universal design for learning (UDL) should be part of all discussions around teaching and learning. UDL principles focus on the design of learning environments that are flexible, inclusive, and student-centered to ensure that all students can access and learn from the course materials, activities, and assignments.12

Evaluating Emergency Remote Teaching

Institutions will certainly want to conduct evaluations of their ERT efforts, but what should they evaluate? First, let's consider what not to evaluate. A common misconception is that comparing a face-to-face course with an online version of the course constitutes a useful evaluation. This type of assessment, known as a media comparison study, provides no real value, for at least three reasons:

First, any medium is simply a way to deliver information, and one medium is not inherently better or worse than any other medium. Second, we need to better understand different media and the way people learn with different media to design effective studies. And, third, there are too many confounding variables in even the best media comparison study for the results to be valid and meaningful.13

Researchers who conduct media comparison studies are looking at ""the whole unique medium and [giving] little thought to each one's attributes and characteristics, to learner needs, or to psychological learning theories.""14

Other approaches to evaluation can be useful in this move to ERT. The success of distance and online learning experiences can be measured in a variety of ways, depending on how ""success"" is defined from a given stakeholder's perspective. From the faculty point of view, student learning outcomes would be of primary interest. Did learners achieve the intended knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes that were the focus of the instructional experience? Attitudinal outcomes are also possibly of interest, for students and for faculty. For students, issues such as interest, motivation, and engagement are directly connected to learner success and so would be possible evaluation foci. For faculty, attitudes toward online instruction and all that it entails can affect the perception of success.

Programmatic outcomes such as course and program completion rates, market reach, faculty time investments, impacts on promotion and tenure processes—all of these are relevant issues related to the offering of distance courses and programs. Finally, implementation resources and strategies are possible areas of evaluation inquiry, such as the reliability of selected technological delivery systems, the provision of and access to learner support systems, support for faculty professional development for online teaching pedagogies and tools, policy and governance issues related to distance program development, and quality assurance. All of these factors can influence the effectiveness of distance and online learning experiences and can serve to inform learning experience design and program development and implementation.15 These recommended areas of evaluation are for well-planned distance or online learning efforts and may not be appropriate in the case of ERT. Evaluating ERT will require broader questions, especially during initial implementations.

Next, let us recommend where you should focus your evaluation related to ERT efforts. The language of the CIPP model will be used for structure.16 CIPP is an acronym representing context, inputs, process, and products (see table 1).

Table 1. CIPP evaluation terms

Context Evaluations Input Evaluations Process Evaluations Product Evaluations ""Assess needs, problems, assets, and opportunities, as well as relevant contextual conditions and dynamics"" ""Assess a program's strategy, action plan, staffing arrangements, and budget for feasibility and potential cost-effectiveness to meet targeted needs and achieve goals."" ""Monitor, document, assess, and report on the implementation of plans."" ""Identify and assess costs and outcomes—intended and unintended, short term and long term.""

In the case of ERT, institutions might want to consider evaluation questions such as the following:

Given the need to shift to remote instruction, what internal and external resources were necessary in supporting this transition? What aspects of the context (institutional, social, governmental) affected the feasibility and effectiveness of the transition? (context)

How did the university interactions with students, families, personnel, and local and government stakeholders impact perceived responsiveness to the shift to ERT? (context)

Was the technology infrastructure sufficient to handle the needs of ERT? (input)

Did the campus support staff have sufficient capacity to handle the needs of ERT? (input)

Was our ongoing faculty professional development sufficient to enable ERT? How can we enhance opportunities for immediate and flexible learning demands related to alternative approaches to instruction and learning? (input)

Where did faculty, students, support personnel, and administrators struggle the most with ERT? How can we adapt our processes to respond to such operational challenges in the future? (process)

What were the programmatic outcomes of the ERT initiative (i.e., course completion rates, aggregated grade analyses, etc.)? How can challenges related to these outcomes be addressed in support of the students and faculty impacted by these issues? (product)

How can feedback from learners, faculty, and campus support teams inform ERT needs in the future? (product)

Evaluation of ERT should be more focused on the context, input, and process elements than product (learning). Note that we are not advocating for no evaluation of whether or not learning occurred, or to what extent it occurred, but simply stressing that the urgency of ERT and all that will take to make it happen in a short time frame will be the most critical elements to evaluate during this crisis. This is being recognized by some as a few institutions are beginning to announce changing to pass/fail options rather letter grades during ERT.17

Also, given the continued evidence of problems surrounding student evaluations of instruction under typical higher education experiences, we recommend that the standard, end-of-semester teaching evaluations definitely not be counted against faculty members engaged in ERT.18 If an institution's policy mandates that those evaluations be administered, consider amending the policy, or make sure that the results are clearly qualified with the circumstances of the term or semester.

Final Thoughts

Everyone involved in this abrupt migration to online learning must realize that these crises and disasters also create disruptions to student, staff, and faculty lives, outside their association with the university. So all of this work must be done with the understanding that the move to ERT will likely not be the priority of all those involved. Instructors and administrators are urged to consider that students might not be able to attend to courses immediately. As a result, asynchronous activities might be more reasonable than synchronous ones. Flexibility with deadlines for assignments within courses, course policies, and institutional policies should be considered. For a high-level example, the US Department of Education has relaxed some requirements and policies in the face of COVID-19.19

Hopefully the COVID-19 threat will soon be a memory. When it is, we should not simply return to our teaching and learning practices prior to the virus, forgetting about ERT. There likely will be future public health and safety concerns, and in recent years, campuses have been closed due to natural disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, and the polar vortex.20 Thus, the possible need for ERT must become part of a faculty member's skill set, as well as professional development programming for any personnel involved in the instructional mission of colleges and universities.

The threat of COVID-19 has presented some unique challenges for institutions of higher education. All parties involved—students, faculty, and staff—are being asked to do extraordinary things regarding course delivery and learning that have not been seen on this scale in the lifetimes of anyone currently involved. Although this situation is stressful, when it is over, institutions will emerge with an opportunity to evaluate how well they were able to implement ERT to maintain continuity of instruction. It is important to avoid the temptation to equate ERT with online learning during those evaluations. With careful planning, officials at every campus can evaluate their efforts, allowing those involved to highlight strengths and identify weaknesses to be better prepared for future needs to implement ERT.

We at Valohai are big believers in remote work. Having practiced with a distributed team for a good 4 years we would like to share some of our thoughts on remote work in Machine Learning. A lot of major pain points we have seen revolve around tooling.

There are a host of things to consider but we are going to focus on the specifics of machine learning and data science. Here are the two main considerations

Access to data and compute

Collaboration and sharing your work

Access to data and compute

There are so-called natural and artificial/legal reasons that limit access to data and compute.

Natural

A lot of the datasets are so big that they do not really fit on an average laptop or workstation and the computation on those datasets is so big that an average single GPU laptop cannot give an effective workflow.

Naturally, companies are tackling this with on-prem clusters, on-prem compute workstations and moving larger compute on the cloud. Remote access for cloud is the easiest to handle and one of the good reasons to justify a larger price that cloud services ask.

Companies with on-prem clusters depend heavily on the capabilities of their dev-ops teams and how well they have organized remote access for teams. These environments can often be less than robust and possible outages in today's landscape can completely immobilize your ML progress. So I would suggest you make sure your dev-ops teams prioritize hardening remote access solutions. The burden of everyone in the company going remote can cause surprising increases in loads.

The toughest situation is with teams who have individual compute workstations. These often don't have robust remote access solutions and its quite common to lose connection to these types of workstations. The way it looks like most companies are going to be locked down for a better part of the month. Now is a good time to assess whether cloud could be a solution for you or if your company has compute clusters that dev-ops is actively maintaining.

In an optimal case, you would have a centralized machine learning platform that takes care of access to compute and automatically manages your data without the data scientists really needing to spend time on that. Now is also a good time to look into possible solutions like Valohai that might be quick to implement and help you get a productivity jump from remote work instead of losing productivity. (A shameless plug I know ;)

Artificial/Legal limitations

A lot of the data that companies have on-prem or in hardened cloud systems is not allowed or should not be downloaded on individual workstations or laptops. This can make the workflows around working on real data extremely frustrating for data scientists and machine learning engineers.

Easy access to cloud or on-prem compute and a streamlined way to execute code on those systems reduces the risk of having a data breach significantly. Everyone can imagine the risks involved in 100 laptops that contain private data meant for R&D purposes floating around in a 30-day full remote situation.

Again companies that have employed or employ an ML platform that streamlines their work on managed clusters on-premise and on the cloud will see a relatively small drop in productivity when going remote.

Collaboration

No-one works alone. The biggest reason why some software companies can be completely distributed is again tooling. Version control like Git, online meeting tools, Slack, etc. make it possible for people to be extremely productive while not sharing the same space.

However, it did not start like this. Software development is starting to be a mature industry with streamlined workflows that we have collectively been practicing for decades now. Especially version control and workflows like pull requests have made it possible for more distributed teams to work effectively.

This is not necessarily true for data science and machine learning. In many ways, machine learning is more complicated than software development. Instead of just code, you are also tracking data, parameters, results, etc.

In a remote environment, it’s no longer effective to just walk to your colleague and show them how your notebook should be used. You need a better way to collaborate. Preferably something that offers reproducibility and version control for your experiments both for Jupyter notebook experimentation and production code.

In a remote environment, there is a need to over-communicate everything and nothing achieves that better than complete reproducibility and version control for experiments. Not to mention that risks are greatly reduced when anyone can pick up where someone left off and hit the ground running in case someone is out for a week or two.

If you are looking for a platform that can achieve these tasks Valohai can be a good solution for you to quickly get you ready for remote work and get that productivity jump people talk about. Valohai installation and onboarding can take as little as one day in your environment so act now if you want to give productive remote work a try!

If you are looking for a platform that can achieve these tasks Valohai can be a good solution for you to quickly get you ready for remote work and get that productivity jump people talk about. Valohai installation and onboarding can take as little as one day in your environment so act now if you want to give productive remote work a try! If you want to hear more book a demo .

https://catlintucker.com/2020/03/3-ways-to-use-video-conferencing/,"Thank goodness for Zoom and Google Meet! During this time of social isolation and remote learning, these video conferencing tools are lifesavers. They make it possible for teachers to maintain a human connection with their students and guide their learning from a distance. Below are three suggestions for using these video conferencing platforms to continue teaching students as they learn remotely.

#1 Small Group Instruction

Teachers can host a series of short Zoom or Google Meet sessions throughout the day focused on different skills or topics. These online sessions are an excellent way to continue teaching and connecting with learners. Even if teachers cannot require that students attend a live meeting due to concerns around access, connectivity, and availability, these sessions can be recorded and posted on class websites, Google Classroom, or a learning management system.

As teachers think about hosting virtual meetings, I would encourage them to approach the design of this time with intention. Structuring a small group instruction session will help to engage students and make the experience more meaningful for them. It is essential to build in time for them to discuss information and ask questions.

If teachers are planning to use video conference to simply transfer information (e.g., lectures or mini-lessons), I would suggest recording a video and allowing students to self-pace through that video. Then the valuable and limited time you have with students in a video conferencing session can be spent on more hands-on, collaborative, and engaging tasks.

#2 Facilitate a Small Group Discussion

Teachers can invite students to participate in a small group discussion about a chapter they read in a text or the textbook, debrief about a flipped video lesson, or unpack complex issues or topics related to your subject area.

Ideally, I would suggest teachers provide the discussion questions ahead of time to allow students to think about them before the conversation. I also recommend providing students with an online space where they can crowdsource and capture questions they would like to discuss. Teachers can do this using Mentimeter by asking an open-ended question, on a shared online document, or simply asking students to write down three questions on paper that they can bring to the conversation.

#3 Conferencing with Students

Conferencing online with students about their goals, progress, questions, and concerns is a powerful way to use video conferencing capabilities. Teachers can create a schedule of timeslots using an online calendar, like Google Calendar or Calendy, to allow students to sign up for 5-minute conferencing sessions.

I am a fan of using a goal-setting activity to guide conferencing sessions about student progress. In the past, I have used the SMART goal format to get students thinking about what they want to achieve in a grading period; however, given the fluid nature of the COVID-19 and school closures, I would encourage teachers to embrace goal-setting on a smaller scale (e.g., one week at a time).

I adapted Simon Sinek’s golden circle from his book Start with Why to get students thinking about why they want to achieve a particular goal (academic or personal), how they will go about achieving it, and what success will look or feel like.

Teachers can make a copy of the Google Drawing above and share it with students via Google Classroom. This goal-setting activity engages students in the metacognitive practice of setting a personal or academic goal at the start of each week. Then teachers can reference this goal during conferencing sessions. They can also end each week by asking students to reflect on their progress toward their goal that week in a journal or online reflective log.

Optional video conferencing sessions can offer students an avenue to connect and get the support they need during this tough time. I have also heard teachers on Twitter talk about offering parent Q&A sessions or coffee chats with families to keep them in the loop and lower anxiety levels. Other teachers are meeting with their professional learning communities (PLCs) to discuss lesson design, book study texts or education podcasts, or simply share what is working as they move curriculum online.

There are myriad ways to leverage video conferencing during this time of social isolation and remote learning. If you are using video conferencing with students, teachers, or families and want to share your approach, please take a moment to post a comment so we can learn from each other!","Xa����ώBl�d��Xղ�~��ǁ>�\�Wm�dg�""�_�ھ����j�Ԛvq߬�������uØSX?p��wVY�>�0�ճ��ԍ��_���\������V�x5�c.�,ވ������FLV�x""/�6�v�w�3�:��}+�L�{�

As coronavirus hot spots flare from coast to coast, the demand for safety equipment — also known as personal protective equipment (PPE) — is both immediate and widespread , with health officials, hospital executives and governors saying that their shortages are critical and that health-care workers are putting their lives at risk while trying to help the surging number of patients. Two DHS officials said the stores kept in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Strategic National Stockpile are nearly gone. AD AD During Wednesday’s White House briefing, President Trump confirmed the stockpile is nearly depleted, telling reporters his administration has sent supplies “directly to hospitals.” Read full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak “The stockpile was designed to respond to a handful of cities. It was never built or designed to fight a 50-state pandemic,” said a DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about the stockpile. “This is not only a U.S. government problem. The supply chain for PPE worldwide has broken down, and there is a lot of price-gouging happening.” Trump said during Tuesday’s White House briefing that the administration has nearly 10,000 ventilators on reserve and that authorities are ready to deploy the lifesaving equipment rapidly to coronavirus hot spots in coming weeks. He also said large amounts of PPE were being shipped directly from manufacturers to hospitals. But the DHS officials said the stockpile has not been able to handle the load. Hospitals and states face a real risk of running out of supplies, one of the officials said. “If you can’t protect the people taking care of us, it gets ugly.” AD AD Several reports in recent days have documented a Wild West-style online marketplace for bulk medical supplies dominated by intermediaries and hoarders who are selling N95 respirator masks and other gear at huge markups. Forbes reported that U.S. vendors have sold 280 million masks — mostly into the export market — and that U.S. states and local governments were outbid in the frenzy. The Washington Post and Reuters have reported this week on the stockpile’s dwindling supplies. There are few signs the Trump administration is making efforts to stop the export shipments or seize the supplies for use in U.S. hospitals, despite statements from Attorney General William P. Barr last week that U.S. wholesalers hoarding masks and other supplies  would get “a knock on your door.” Governors plead for medical equipment from federal stockpile plagued by shortages and confusion Governors have been pleading with federal authorities to ship more equipment and protective gear. Distribution of the supplies has happened unevenly, with some states saying they’ve received a fraction of the supplies they desperately need and some cities having received no assistance from their state governments. AD AD Officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said the government had anticipated the Strategic National Stockpile would be exhausted, and the administration is moving swiftly to procure and distribute supplies. “FEMA planning assumptions for COVID-19 pandemic response acknowledged that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) alone could not fulfill all requirements at the State and tribal level,” Janet Montesi, a FEMA spokeswoman, said in a statement. “The federal government will exhaust all means to identify and attain medical and other supplies needed to combat the virus.” The government has more than $16 billion available to make the acquisitions, she said. AD “We remain committed to helping ensure key medical supplies expeditiously arrive at the front lines for our health care workers,” Montesi said. AD According to the White House, FEMA had shipped or delivered 11.6 million N95 respirator masks, 26 million surgical masks, 5.2 million face shields, 4.3 million surgical gowns, 22 million gloves and 8,100 ventilators as of March 28. U.S. cities have acute shortages of masks, test kits, ventilators as they face coronavirus threat A stockpile of 1.5 million expired N95 masks that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has in storage will be distributed to the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, CBP said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for the safe use of masks with expiration dates that have passed, potentially leaving their elastic bands too loose to form a proper face seal. AD Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said this week she and other lawmakers were told some of the expired CBP masks would be given to hospitals. AD “Officials confirmed that the masks would indeed go to healthcare workers and be prioritized by highest need such as NY and NJ. I will follow up to make sure this happens!” she tweeted Sunday. Desperate for medical equipment, states encounter a beleaguered national stockpile A CBP official on Wednesday confirmed to The Washington Post that the masks would go to ICE agents and TSA officers instead, not to FEMA staff or medical personnel. The government has long viewed the national stockpile supplies as a holdover during an emergency so the government could buy time for manufacturers to boost output and for new supply chains to solidify, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly. Having the medical supplies sitting in a warehouse doesn’t serve any purpose, the official said, even though the administration has been holding back thousands of ventilators. AD AD Asked about concerns that the government will not be able to keep pace with the demand for PPE supplies, the official said the government has planes coming in from Asia every day for the next few weeks ferrying new materials , noting that a planeload with 80 tons of PPE arrived from China on Sunday.

https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/13/coronavirus-and-toilet-paper-texas-residents-rushing-grocery-stores/?utm_campaign=trib-social&utm_content=1584140739&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"Texans don’t need to rush out and stock up on groceries or household items: There’s no shortage if everyone takes only what they need.

That’s the message from Texas officials and industry representatives, who say preparing for a health disaster like the state's COVID-19 outbreaks is different from a natural disaster.

""There is absolutely no need to go out and stockpile supplies,” Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday as he declared a statewide emergency. “This isn’t the type of situation like where we see with an oncoming hurricane.""

Dya Campos, a spokesperson for H-E-B, said the San Antonio-based grocery chain has been planning to meet coronavirus-inspired demand and echoed the governor’s advice.

H-E-B's strategy to meet increased demand during the ongoing coronavirus crisis is to make sure people will find enough groceries in the stores for months— not to stock up for everyone to buy it all in a day or week.

“If we think long term, we can ease the panic ... if our customers just relax knowing that we are not going to completely run out of product if we can just have the time to be able to restock our shelves,"" she said.

Campos said there isn't a shortage of products in the supply chain. Shelves are just temporarily empty because customers are buying items faster than trucks can deliver the products. But the stores are replenishing the items daily, she said.

Representatives for Albertsons, Kroger and Walmart did not respond to interview requests.

Joseph Welsh is a retail supermarket consultant and agrees that buyers are overreacting.

He said since grocery stores can’t suddenly increase their inventories for a spike in demand, they usually turn to limits on the number of items per customer and stick to their normal restocking schedule to conserve supplies.

The rush for groceries comes as cases of community spread have appeared in two of Texas’ largest urban areas. Federal and state health officials have encouraged people to slow the spread of coronavirus through social distancing. Businesses and local governments are taking heed by canceling large gatherings and telling employees to work from home.

The state’s capacity for testing people for the virus was limited to about 200 people per day but is expanding to thousands, Abbott said in his declaration of a health disaster Friday.

Campos said some H-E-B stores have started capping the number of essentials per person.

“We really just need Texans to realize that this is going to be a long-term situation,” Campos said. “Unlike a hurricane, [which is] three weeks of intensity and then clean up afterward, Texans need to be prepared for more long-term awareness of coronavirus,” Campos said.

The government failed to buy crucial protective equipment to cope with a pandemic, a BBC investigation has found.

There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK.

NHS staff say they are being put at risk because of the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).

The government said it has taken the right steps and is doing everything it can to increase stocks.

The investigation by BBC Panorama found that vital items were left out of the stockpile when it was set up in 2009 and that the government subsequently ignored a warning from its own advisers to buy missing equipment.

The expert committee that advises the government on pandemics, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), recommended the purchase of gowns last June.

Gowns are currently one of the items in shortest supply in the UK and they are now difficult to source because of the global shortage of PPE.

Doctors and nurses have complained that there are also shortages of the life-saving FFP3 respirator masks.

Panorama has discovered that millions of FFP3 respirator masks are unaccounted for.

There were 33 million on the original 2009 procurement list for the stockpile, but only 12 million have been handed out.

The government refuses to explain where the other masks have gone.

A government spokesperson said there was ""limited demand"" for the masks coming through the Supply Disruption Line, ""which is one reason why they haven't all been distributed"".

They added that gowns were a recent recommendation from the advisory group and would be procured for the ""future stockpile build up alongside all other necessary equipment"".

Panorama has spoken to a number of NHS insiders about PPE who wish to remain anonymous.

""There is a complete lack of transparency from the government. They are creating panic, as we don't know if they can supply us so we are scrambling to get it elsewhere,"" a head of procurement told the programme.

The government also failed to stockpile visors, the swabs needed for testing and the body bags needed for the dead.

Professor John Ashton, a public health expert and long-standing critic of the government, told the programme the lack of preparation was breathtaking.

""The consequence of not planning; not ordering kit; not having stockpiles is that we are sending into the front line doctors, nurses, other health workers and social care workers without the equipment to keep them safe,"" he said.

A government spokesperson said the stockpile was designed for a flu pandemic and that Covid-19 is a different disease with a higher hospitalisation rate.

They said swabs and body bags were not recommended by Nervtag historically, but eye protection was, so the stockpile contains safety glasses.

Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report.

""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we are doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so throughout this crisis,"" she said.

Panorama also investigated changes to the government guidance on what PPE NHS staff should wear.

In January this year, Covid-19 was officially designated a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID). The decision was made in consultation with a group of British experts.

A Health and Safety Executive evaluation of PPE published in 2019 had already recommended that all healthcare workers should wear a gown, FFP3 respirator mask and visor when dealing with HCIDs.

Those recommendations were in line with existing UK guidance.

Image caption An NHS worker is pictured wearing a plastic bag as a hair cover

But on 13 March this year, the government downgraded its guidance on PPE and told NHS staff they were safe to wear less protective aprons and basic surgical masks in all but the most high risk circumstances.

Panorama understands that on the same day, the government took steps to remove Covid-19 from the list of HCIDs.

But the experts who had recommended the coronavirus be put on the list in the first place were not consulted. Instead, the government asked its Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP).

Panorama has discovered that the ACDP was only asked to consider the matter on the morning of its 13 March meeting. It was added to the committee's agenda under ""any other business"".

The committee backed the decision to remove Covid-19 from the HCID list, but sources on that committee have told Panorama that it had to be, in part, a pragmatic decision based on the availability of PPE.

It was another six days before Public Health England announced that the coronavirus was no longer considered an HCID.

A government spokesperson said Covid-19 was taken off the list because it has a low overall mortality rate and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific laboratory test for the virus.

They added the committee's advice that Covid-19 no longer be considered an HCID was based entirely on scientific considerations.

""The HCID classification is used for serious infections where there are limited numbers of cases requiring specialist input and facilities,"" the spokesperson said.

""This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice.

""The government has been working day and night to battle against coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed at all times to protect our NHS and save lives.""

https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/414362/shopper-who-used-team-to-stockpile-10k-of-toilet-paper-sanitiser-refused-refund,"A shopper has attempted to return thousands of dollars' worth of supplies to an Australian supermarket after stockpiling them at the start of the coronavirus panic buying outbreak, a retailer says.

The man, who had tried and failed to re-sell the goods online, was turned down for a refund when he approached an Adelaide supermarket.

Drakes Supermarkets director John-Paul Drake said the man called the supermarket to try to get a refund on 132 packs of toilet rolls and 150 one-litre bottles of hand sanitiser.

*See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19

He said the shopper bought the goods, worth around $10,000, with the help of a ""team"" of stockpilers when panic buying surged about four weeks ago.

""In that conversation [the shopper said] 'my eBay site has been shut down, so we couldn't profiteer off that',"" Drake told ABC Radio Adelaide.

Drake described that kind of stockpiling as ""absolutely disgraceful"", and said it was the reason that supermarkets had had to ""band together"" to introduce purchasing limits on products like toilet paper and hand sanitiser during the coronavirus crisis.

""The rest of my team [is] over this sort of behaviour and having to police people taking more than they need - that's a tough thing to deal with,"" he said.

""I never thought I'd been in a situation that I'm seeing here.

""We're not used to it, no-one is used to it, when people take advantage of the system.

""It's not necessarily being sold here or used here, or hoarded here - it's being marked up [online] for a considerable amount.""

Last month, Australia's competition watchdog flipped a key rule of consumer law in response to the coronavirus pandemic, allowing supermarkets to work together to ensure shoppers can get food at a fair price.

Usually supermarkets and suppliers working together in the market would be dubbed collusion, and would be punishable by huge fines from the competition regulator.

But in a temporary measure, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) allowed supermarkets to coordinate with each other ""when working with manufacturers, suppliers, and transport and logistics providers"".

The authorisation, which applies to Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and Metcash, which runs IGA supermarkets, did not allow supermarkets to agree on retail prices for products.

The ACCC said the interim ruling was intended to ""ensure the supply and the fair and equitable distribution of fresh food, groceries, and other household items to Australian consumers.""

Drake described that kind of stockpiling as ""absolutely disgraceful"", and said it was the reason that supermarkets had had to ""band together"" to introduce purchasing limits on products like toilet paper and hand sanitiser during the coronavirus crisis.  ""The rest of my team [is] over this sort of behaviour and having to police people taking more than they need - that's a tough thing to deal with,"" he said.  ""I never thought I'd been in a situation that I'm seeing here.  ""We're not used to it, no-one is used to it, when people take advantage of the system.  ""It's not necessarily being sold here or used here, or hoarded here - it's being marked up [online] for a considerable amount.""  Last month, Australia's competition watchdog flipped a key rule of consumer law in response to the coronavirus pandemic, allowing supermarkets to work together to ensure shoppers can get food at a fair price.  Usually supermarkets and suppliers working together in the market would be dubbed collusion, and would be punishable by huge fines from the competition regulator.  But in a temporary measure, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) allowed supermarkets to coordinate with each other ""when working with manufacturers, suppliers, and transport and logistics providers"".  The authorisation, which applies to Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and Metcash, which runs IGA supermarkets, did not allow supermarkets to agree on retail prices for products.  The ACCC said the interim ruling was intended to ""ensure the supply and the fair and equitable distribution of fresh food, groceries, and other household items to Australian consumers.""  - ABC    If you have symptoms of the coronavirus, call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 (+64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs) or call your GP - don't show up at a medical centre        Share this    Share on Twitter  Share on Facebook  Share via email  Share on Reddit  Share on Linked In      Copyright © 2020 , Radio New Zealand        Subscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter                 View latest newsletter      Next story in World  Latest Covid-19 developments from around the world for 15 April                  Sign up for daily emails     Subscribe to the podcast    Full coverage       Related Stories      Sticking to lockdown rules gets harder the longer it continues   10 Apr 2020       The Covid-19 pandemic has forced millions to live under strict lockdown conditions, but people are likely to find it harder to stick to the rules the longer the situation continues.

https://globalnews.ca/news/6858818/coronavirus-china-united-front-canada-protective-equipment-shortage/,"Editor’s Note: One of the graphics contained in this piece has been updated to more clearly represent the Chinese Communist Party’s broad surveillance and attempted control of parts of the Chinese diaspora.

In mid-January, Chinese consulates in Canada and worldwide issued an urgent call. China was concerned that the new coronavirus raging in Wuhan was so deadly and infectious that its nurses and doctors would run out of safety supplies.

It needed personal protective equipment (PPE).

In just six weeks, China imported 2.5 billion pieces of epidemic safety equipment, including over two billion safety masks, Chinese government data shows.

And this raises big concerns on a number of fronts, say critics, including Conservative MP Erin O’Toole.

China was evidently hiding the extent of a pandemic that endangered the world while covertly securing PPE at low prices. This “surreptitious” operation left “the world naked with no supply of PPE,” Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to Beijing, told Global News.

The result: starting in March, after COVID-19 had circled the globe, countries that provided masks to China in January and February were forced to compete for China’s supply.

By late January, sources in manufacturing and military circles were warning western governments that China seemed to be covertly seizing global PPE supply, O’Toole and Guajardo said.

But leaders in Canada didn’t act, according to O’Toole.

“One source told me in January it became well-known amongst military and emergency services that China was stockpiling masks and basically buying out as many quantities as it could,” he said in an interview with Global News. “And we know, … that senior officials, in the end of January and the early days of February, are equally aware at Public Works Canada, with respect to a run on PPEs.”

An investigation by Global News examines the troubling methods and underground actors used by Beijing to quietly corner the world’s supply of PPE in a state-level operation.

China used diplomatic channels, state-owned businesses and Chinese diaspora community associations that are thought to be increasingly under the influence of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s powerful United Front Work Department (UFWD).

And through clandestine United Front networks run out of Chinese consulates in cities from Vancouver to Toronto to New York to Melbourne to Tokyo, the Communist Party urged millions of “overseas Chinese” to bulk-buy N95 masks in order to ship “back batches of scarce supplies for the motherland.”

As troubling as China’s methods were, the operation looks even worse under a magnifying glass because some organizations seemingly involved in the United Front’s efforts in Canada include members that have previously been monitored or investigated by the RCMP and Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), according to RCMP and CSIS sources.

Under the radar

China’s PPE import operation was portrayed by its state media as a warlike effort. And it was a dramatic success.

According to a U.S. congressional report released in April, from Jan. 24 to Feb. 29, China ramped up its production of masks and slapped export restrictions on China-based foreign companies such as Canadian mask maker Medicom and U.S. mask maker 3M.

At the same time, China imported 2.02 billion safety masks, according to Beijing’s March 2020 customs records.

“To ensure sufficient domestic supplies to counter COVID-19 (Beijing directed) regional offices in China and overseas to work with PRC industry associations to prioritize securing supplies from global sources,” the report says.

The global callout for masks was posted to UFWD websites and sent to Chinese consulates where United Front officials are embedded.

The requests occurred around Jan. 14 and 15, when Chinese officials received confidential instructions from Xi, and all regions were warned to “prepare for and respond to a pandemic,” according to leaked documents cited in an Associated Press investigation. Hospital staff were ordered to don protective gear.

Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to Beijing, told Global News that by Jan. 23, when China locked down Wuhan, he had recognized Beijing was involved in massive PPE imports.

Guajardo, who now works in a Washington, D.C., consultancy, said in mid-January, he was contacted by a source in Mexican supply chain logistics.

“They said, you know a funny thing, I’m being swamped by orders to send all the N95 I can find to China.”

He said he completed some checks in the United States and judged PPE stock was vanishing from retail locations through “under the radar” methods.

“I thought, ‘Oh my God, they are buying all the N95 supply in the world,’” Guajardo told Global News.

He was so convinced that he sent an ominous tweet on Jan. 27 forecasting an impending shortage of PPE in North America.

As sure as day follows night, a shortage of something in China is soon reflected closer to home. No surgical masks in the Washington, DC area. My guess is people are buying them in bulk to send/sell in China. pic.twitter.com/ctUGfj3Sh4 — Jorge Guajardo (@jorge_guajardo) January 28, 2020

In March, the masks sold to China in January and February were being sold back to Mexico at 20 to 30 times the price, according to Guajardo.

And the Washington Post and CNN reported in April that PPE is sometimes costing more than 1,000 percent the prices seen in early January.

“This pandemic got complicated because of China’s coverup at the start,” Guajardo said. “And now it is further complicated by China leaving the world naked with no supply of PPE.

“They started the pandemic and now they are profiting from it.”

Guajardo added that in his experience with China, the masks being sold back now will not only come at exorbitant prices and with potential quality defects but with longer-term political demands.

The U.S. congressional report released in April similarly concludes: “The Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery, with designated countries selected, according to political calculations.”

In an interview, O’Toole, the Conservative MP, said that in Canada, he was hearing the same PPE warnings from his sources in January that Guajardo was getting from sources in Mexico and the United States.

O’Toole said he knows “for a fact” that senior Canadian bureaucrats in January were alerted that China was hoarding PPE. But instead of responding to the threat, Canada’s government shipped 16 tonnes of PPE to China.

O’Toole says he believes the methods Beijing used to secure PPE and Canada’s response need to be investigated in a broad national inquiry when coronavirus health risks finally recede.

“The Communist Party of China willfully withheld information on an outbreak for at least weeks, if not months,” O’Toole said. “It not only gave the world less time to respond, it downplayed the potential severity of the threat. Countries did not make decisions with respect to flight bans and (protecting) PPE stores.”

Asked by Global News to respond to O’Toole’s assertion, a spokesperson for Public Health Canada said that in January, officials started to monitor the coronavirus in China and “initiated work with Public Services and Procurement Canada to procure supplies needed to respond to a possible outbreak in Canada.”

Internal Public Health Canada emails indicate that on Jan. 31 Minister Patty Hajdu approved a donation of PPE to China from Canada’s emergency stockpile including “stuff that (would be) expiring in Feb. and March.” The ministry believed this donation would not compromise Canada’s PPE supply, the emails say.

Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged that two planes from Canada sent to purchase PPE in China have now returned empty.

Trudeau cited congestion at Chinese airports and restrictions that only allow planes to wait for cargo for short periods. But China called Trudeau’s claim “inaccurate.”

After this story was published Global News asked Trudeau whether he was aware in January that China was engaged in a global operation to secure PPE, and if his government was aware, why no action was taken to protect Canada’s supply.

“As of Jan. 2 our chief public health officer convened a group of provincial public health officers to advise that there were reports of a new virus present in China,” Trudeau said Thursday. “Our intelligence services were tracking and aware of the issues and we got regular updates through the month of January. Further than that, I don’t have anything to add.”

Chinese consulates and community associations named in this story have not yet responded to questions from Global News.

‘Every overseas Chinese is a warrior’

A review of official reports from state media such as Xinhua as well as UFWD web pages in China and reports from associated Chinese-Canadian community groups, record massive PPE shipments of at least 100 tonnes from Canada to China in January and February.

The efforts were organized through consulates in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. In Vancouver and Toronto, business associations officially tied to the UFWD appear to have taken the lead in the global drive for N95 masks, also securing and shipping PPE from other countries into China.

A Feb. 3 report in Xinhua documents one facet of the global operation involving millions of migrants from the southern China region of Fujian. The report — subtitled “Every overseas Chinese is a warrior” — bursts with militaristic descriptions that have the ring of propaganda.

“The menacing epidemic came suddenly. But majestic strength comes from front-line medical staff, party members and cadres, from the people, and from Fujian Chinese and overseas Chinese,” the Xinhua report says. “Fujians from dozens of countries on five continents joined this invisible battle … they travelled day and night and raced against time to send back batches of scarce supplies for the motherland.”

The report focuses on the Toronto Fuqing Chamber of Commerce. This is one of the groups that attended a United Front-linked anti-Hong Kong democracy rally in Markham, Ont., in summer 2019.

According to the Xinhua report, the Fuqing chamber president flew to China in January before China’s Spring Festival.

But after “seeing that supplies were becoming scarce, he boarded a flight to Toronto to help with the purchase (of masks),” the report says.

The report makes no mention of the potential COVID-19 risks presented by the Fuqing chamber president flying from China to Toronto at the time of the Spring Festival, when China’s government reportedly issued internal warnings that pandemic spread danger was high. However, there is no indication the Fuqing chamber president knew of pandemic travel risks at the time, because Canada and the World Health Organization were not advising against travel from China into Canada.

According to the Xinhua report — which Global News could not independently verify — after the chamber president landed in Toronto in -25 C weather, he immediately got in a vehicle and drove to Fuqing chamber headquarters and ordered: “Purchase (PPE) in partitions. Act now!”

“Immediately, nearly a hundred overseas Chinese drove to the chamber of commerce,” the Xinhua report says.

In the following days, 200 Fuqing chamber members travelled across Ontario buying up medical supplies, the report says, while in China, an official “worked with the United Front Work Department of Fujian, and customs in Fujian” and various Chinese airlines in order to receive “the medical supplies from Canada.”

The Fuqing chamber president could not be reached for comment.

The reports of large shipments of PPE from Toronto are corroborated by reports from the Toronto office of Hainan Airlines (HNA).

The reports say on Jan. 25, HNA “responded to the call of the state” and transferred loads of PPE to China that were donated by “foreign government departments, charities, social organizations, and overseas Chinese.” By mid-February, HNA had delivered 56 tonnes of PPE from Toronto to China, the reports say.

Meanwhile, on Jan. 26, the Chinese Consulate General in Montreal established an epidemic emergency team to secure PPE for China and “communicated with more than 10 Canadian government officials at three levels.”

Through businesses and “overseas Chinese and student groups,” the consulate in Montreal assisted dozens of groups to fly more than 30 tonnes of masks and protective clothing to various cities in China, Chinese state reports say.

And on Jan. 23 in Vancouver, Yongtao Chen, a real estate developer and the chairman of the Canadian Alliance of Chinese Associations (CACA), was alerted by the Chinese consulate of the desperate need for PPE in Wuhan, Chinese state reports say.

CACA is a “controlling level” United Front group in Canada, according to Chen Yonglin, a former Chinese diplomat who has defected to Australia.

And it is a member of the UFWD’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, an organ used by Beijing to influence the Chinese diaspora, according to the 2018 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.

CACA leaders worked with the Vancouver consulate through an epidemic-response WeChat group to raise funds and organize the purchase of PPE in Canada and elsewhere, a Jan. 31 report by a CACA-linked website says.

“Through various channels, the joint meeting has snapped up protective clothing, disinfectant, masks and other protective materials, and is stepping up arrangements to ship to Wuhan,” the report says.

CSIS and RCMP investigations

At least one of the Vancouver-led groups that appears to be involved with CACA in Beijing’s PPE drive, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Federation, includes members who have attracted the attention of Canadian national security and law enforcement investigations, sources with knowledge of RCMP and CSIS files said. Leaders of the federation could not be reached for comment.

A March 23 report from the All-China Federation of Returned Chinese Overseas outlined PPE shipping efforts of the Guangdong federation, which has members in 131 countries. The report quoted Guangdong federation leader Ruji Feng, president of the Canada Chao Shan Association in Vancouver, saying “the local communities actively co-operate with the embassies and consulates to promote and contact all community overseas Chinese groups to prepare various medical supplies.”

Feng’s group also assisted CACA in airlifting 60 boxes of PPE from Manila, Philippines to China, the report said.

A man who answered Canada Chao Shan’s listed number in Vancouver told Global News that he is not connected with the association and could not locate directors to comment for this story.

A review by Global News of Panama Papers offshore banking records and B.C. criminal and civil court records shows that some Canada Chao Shan members — who are mostly located in Vancouver but also in southern China — are connected to alleged underground financial activities.

In 2003, one of the Vancouver members, Xun Chuang, was given an 18-month conditional sentence on production of narcotics charges and a 10-year firearms prohibition, B.C. criminal records show. And according to B.C. Supreme Court civil case filings and sources, Xun Chuang and his Canada Chao Shan officer address are connected to suspects targeted in the RCMP’s E-Pirate investigation, Canada’s largest-ever casino money-laundering and underground banking investigation.

Xun Chuang could not be located for comment through the law firm that handled one of his real estate lending cases. He was not named as a suspect or charged in the E-Pirate investigation.

The suspects connected to Xun Chuang were allegedly involved in real estate lending and casino loan-sharking operations connected to drug trafficking and underground banking in Richmond, B.C., and mainland China.

However, money-laundering and tax evasion charges in the E-Pirate investigation were stayed before suspects went to trial due to evidence disclosure errors by federal prosecutors. The allegations have not been proven.

The group, Canada Chao Shan, and some associated with the group are known to CSIS agents, a source who could not be identified confirmed.

United Front links between Australia, Canada and southern China

Similar murky United Front networks have been investigated in Australia, where the Australian government implemented PPE export bans on March 29 after several Chinese real estate developers sent well over 82 tonnes of PPE to China, according to a U.S. congressional report.

One of the southern China-based United Front groups involved was connected to allegations of organized crime and suspicious “casino junket” activity, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported.

And the Guangdong and Chao Shan United Front groups active in Australia are also linked to Canadian group leaders, Chinese UFWD meeting records show. One prominent Guangdong federation United Front leader named Xiangmo Huang, who is a billionaire real estate developer and casino high roller, was barred from Australia in 2018 on national security grounds.

Alex Joske, a United Front expert and researcher with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that the All-China Federation of Returned Chinese Overseas — of which the Guangdong federations in Canada and Australia are a part — is an increasingly important part of Chinese President Xi’s United Front diaspora control strategy.

Joske told Global News that China’s Communist Party uses organized crime and United Front groups for strategic uses abroad.

“In Australia, we’ve observed overlap between political influence operations, intelligence agencies and organized crime,” Joske said. “For example, a gambling junket operator and alleged criminal figure who also runs groups that report back to the United Front Work Department and collect information on politicians.”

Jonathan Manthorpe, a Canadian author and United Front expert, has reported that it is believed Ottawa blocked visas for 200 Guangdong federation officials seeking to visit Vancouver in 2018, based on national security grounds. However CSIS would not confirm to Global News whether it advised Ottawa to block the visas.

In an interview, Manthorpe told Global News that Xi has vastly increased resources of the United Front, which Xi calls a “magic weapon.”

“The United Front Works Department is, to put it very simply, a political warfare operation,” Manthorpe said. “It’s in all the embassies and consulates in Canada.”

And United Front operatives seeded in Chinese consulates worldwide create and take over “seemingly innocuous groups, most of them embedded in ethnic Chinese communities not only in Canada but in all the countries where the Chinese diaspora of around 50 million people now live,” Manthorpe said.

Manthorpe says a particularly troubling aspect of the United Front’s mass mobilization of Chinese immigrants for the collection of PPE is the Chinese Communist Party’s “ability to exert discipline and to demand patriotic loyalty.”

“To me, it is utterly unconscionable that here are Canadians who are being intimidated and pressured in their own country by foreign agents,” Manthorpe said. “These are assaults on our sovereignty, and they are assaults on our national interest. And they are assaults on our citizens. We should not allow that.”

However, Chinese officials have countered criticism that the country cornered the world’s PPE supply, claiming that after China has conquered its internal coronavirus threat, United Front groups including Guangdong Federation members are now distributing PPE to other countries and “overseas Chinese.”

“It is understood that at present, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Federation is also actively coordinating a group of masks and other epidemic prevention materials to be donated to overseas Chinese groups in areas with severe epidemics in Italy, Spain, the United States, Peru, and the United Kingdom, hoping to relieve the current shortage of anti-epidemic materials for overseas Chinese,” a March 23 UFWD report says.

While United Front actors have been on CSIS’s radar since 1998, Manthorpe says, networks are growing rapidly in Canada under Xi’s regime.

And the current threat level was encapsulated in a 2018 CSIS report that says: “The CCP’s United Front activities incorporate co-opting elites, information management, persuasion, as well as accessing strategic information and resources. It has also frequently been a means of facilitating espionage.”

China does not acknowledge that its United Front is used for espionage, and Chinese consulates in Canada did not respond to questions for this story.

John Townsend, CSIS’ head of media relations, would not directly answer whether the national security agency could be investigating the PPE export operations involving United Front groups in Canada, such as Canada Chao Shan.

“Under our act, CSIS clearly has a mandate to investigate espionage and sabotage, terrorism, foreign interference, and subversion and we will continue to use our legal authorities to ensure the government of Canada receives intelligence on these critical issues,” he said.","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              MENU             Go      #Coronavirus                    RETURN TO GLOBAL NEWS                              Coronavirus    United Front groups in Canada helped Beijing stockpile coronavirus safety supplies         By Sam Cooper     April 30th, 2020           Editor’s Note: One of the graphics contained in this piece has been updated to more clearly represent the Chinese Communist Party’s broad surveillance and attempted control of parts of the Chinese diaspora.

Countries did not make decisions with respect to flight bans and (protecting) PPE stores.”        Asked by Global News to respond to O’Toole’s assertion, a spokesperson for Public Health Canada said that in January, officials started to monitor the coronavirus in China and “initiated work with Public Services and Procurement Canada to procure supplies needed to respond to a possible outbreak in Canada.” Internal Public Health Canada emails indicate that on Jan. 31 Minister Patty Hajdu approved a donation of PPE to China from Canada’s emergency stockpile including “stuff that (would be) expiring in Feb. and March.” The ministry believed this donation would not compromise Canada’s PPE supply, the emails say. Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged that two planes from Canada sent to purchase PPE in China have now returned empty. Trudeau cited congestion at Chinese airports and restrictions that only allow planes to wait for cargo for short periods. But China called Trudeau’s claim “inaccurate.” After this story was published Global News asked Trudeau whether he was aware in January that China was engaged in a global operation to secure PPE, and if his government was aware, why no action was taken to protect Canada’s supply. “As of Jan. 2 our chief public health officer convened a group of provincial public health officers to advise that there were reports of a new virus present in China,” Trudeau said Thursday. “Our intelligence services were tracking and aware of the issues and we got regular updates through the month of January. Further than that, I don’t have anything to add.” Chinese consulates and community associations named in this story have not yet responded to questions from Global News. ‘Every overseas Chinese is a warrior’ A review of official reports from state media such as Xinhua as well as UFWD web pages in China and reports from associated Chinese-Canadian community groups, record massive PPE shipments of at least 100 tonnes from Canada to China in January and February. The efforts were organized through consulates in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. In Vancouver and Toronto, business associations officially tied to the UFWD appear to have taken the lead in the global drive for N95 masks, also securing and shipping PPE from other countries into China. A Feb. 3 report in Xinhua documents one facet of the global operation involving millions of migrants from the southern China region of Fujian. The report — subtitled “Every overseas Chinese is a warrior” — bursts with militaristic descriptions that have the ring of propaganda. “The menacing epidemic came suddenly. But majestic strength comes from front-line medical staff, party members and cadres, from the people, and from Fujian Chinese and overseas Chinese,” the Xinhua report says. “Fujians from dozens of countries on five continents joined this invisible battle … they travelled day and night and raced against time to send back batches of scarce supplies for the motherland.” The report focuses on the Toronto Fuqing Chamber of Commerce. This is one of the groups that attended a United Front-linked anti-Hong Kong democracy rally in Markham, Ont., in summer 2019.   READ MORE: Hong Kong Canadians question alleged pro-Beijing backing for prominent Liberal candidate   According to the Xinhua report, the Fuqing chamber president flew to China in January before China’s Spring Festival. But after “seeing that supplies were becoming scarce, he boarded a flight to Toronto to help with the purchase (of masks),” the report says. The report makes no mention of the potential COVID-19 risks presented by the Fuqing chamber president flying from China to Toronto at the time of the Spring Festival, when China’s government reportedly issued internal warnings that pandemic spread danger was high. However, there is no indication the Fuqing chamber president knew of pandemic travel risks at the time, because Canada and the World Health Organization were not advising against travel from China into Canada. According to the Xinhua report —  which Global News could not independently verify  — after the chamber president landed in Toronto in -25 C weather, he immediately got in a vehicle and drove to Fuqing chamber headquarters and ordered: “Purchase (PPE) in partitions. Act now!” “Immediately, nearly a hundred overseas Chinese drove to the chamber of commerce,” the Xinhua report says. In the following days, 200 Fuqing chamber members travelled across Ontario buying up medical supplies, the report says, while in China, an official “worked with the United Front Work Department of Fujian, and customs in Fujian” and various Chinese airlines in order to receive “the medical supplies from Canada.”                 Toronto Fuqing Chamber of Commerce members shipped PPE to China through the United Front Work Department, Xinhua reported.  Xinhua     The Fuqing chamber president could not be reached for comment.  The reports of large shipments of PPE from Toronto are corroborated by reports from the Toronto office of Hainan Airlines (HNA). The reports say on Jan. 25, HNA “responded to the call of the state” and transferred loads of PPE to China that were donated by “foreign government departments, charities, social organizations, and overseas Chinese.” By mid-February, HNA had delivered 56 tonnes of PPE from Toronto to China, the reports say .   READ MORE: Coronavirus: Counterfeit Chinese-made face masks pulled offline after Global News probe   Meanwhile, on Jan. 26, the Chinese Consulate General in Montreal established an epidemic emergency team to secure PPE for China and “communicated with more than 10 Canadian government officials at three levels.” Through businesses and “overseas Chinese and student groups,” the consulate in Montreal assisted dozens of groups to fly more than 30 tonnes of masks and protective clothing to various cities in China, Chinese state reports say. And on Jan. 23 in Vancouver, Yongtao Chen, a real estate developer and the chairman of the Canadian Alliance of Chinese Associations (CACA), was alerted by the Chinese consulate of the desperate need for PPE in Wuhan, Chinese state reports say. CACA is a “controlling level” United Front group in Canada, according to Chen Yonglin, a former Chinese diplomat who has defected to Australia.                 Yonglin Chen, a former Chinese diplomat, alleged the CACA is a directing UFWD group in Canada.  Twitter     And it is a member of the UFWD’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, an organ used by Beijing to influence the Chinese diaspora, according to the 2018 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. CACA leaders worked with the Vancouver consulate through an epidemic-response WeChat group to raise funds and organize the purchase of PPE in Canada and elsewhere, a Jan. 31 report by a CACA-linked website says. “Through various channels, the joint meeting has snapped up protective clothing, disinfectant, masks and other protective materials, and is stepping up arrangements to ship to Wuhan,” the report says. CSIS and RCMP investigations At least one of the Vancouver-led groups that appears to be involved with CACA in Beijing’s PPE drive, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Federation, includes members who have attracted the attention of Canadian national security and law enforcement investigations , sources with knowledge of RCMP and CSIS files said. Leaders of the federation could not be reached for comment. A March 23 report from the All-China Federation of Returned Chinese Overseas outlined PPE shipping efforts of the Guangdong federation, which has members in 131 countries. The report quoted Guangdong federation leader Ruji Feng, president of the Canada Chao Shan Association in Vancouver, saying “the local communities actively co-operate with the embassies and consulates to promote and contact all community overseas Chinese groups to prepare various medical supplies.” READ MORE: Boosting PPE supply ‘not a top priority’ in years before outbreak Feng’s group also assisted CACA in airlifting 60 boxes of PPE from Manila, Philippines to China, the report said. A man who answered Canada Chao Shan’s listed number in Vancouver told Global News that he is not connected with the association and could not locate directors to comment for this story. A review by Global News of Panama Papers offshore banking records and B.C. criminal and civil court records shows that some Canada Chao Shan members — who are mostly located in Vancouver but also in southern China — are connected to alleged underground financial activities. In 2003, one of the Vancouver members, Xun Chuang, was given an 18-month conditional sentence on production of narcotics charges and a 10-year firearms prohibition, B.C. criminal records show. And according to B.C. Supreme Court civil case filings and sources , Xun Chuang and his Canada Chao Shan officer address are connected to suspects targeted in the RCMP’s E-Pirate investigation, Canada’s largest-ever casino money-laundering and underground banking investigation. Xun Chuang could not be located for comment through the law firm that handled one of his real estate lending cases. He was not named as a suspect or charged in the E-Pirate investigation. The suspects connected to Xun Chuang were allegedly involved in real estate lending and casino loan-sharking operations connected to drug trafficking and underground banking in Richmond, B.C., and mainland China. However, money-laundering and tax evasion charges in the E-Pirate investigation were stayed before suspects went to trial due to evidence disclosure errors by federal prosecutors. The allegations have not been proven. The group, Canada Chao Shan, and some associated with the group are known to CSIS agents, a source who could not be identified confirmed. United Front links between Australia, Canada and southern China                 United Front groups in Canada helped direct Beijing’s worldwide PPE ops.  GFX     Similar murky United Front networks have been investigated in Australia, where the Australian government implemented PPE export bans on March 29 after several Chinese real estate developers sent well over 82 tonnes of PPE to China, according to a U.S. congressional report. One of the southern China-based United Front groups involved was connected to allegations of organized crime and suspicious “casino junket” activity, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported. And the Guangdong and Chao Shan United Front groups active in Australia are also linked to Canadian group leaders, Chinese UFWD meeting records show. One prominent Guangdong federation United Front leader named Xiangmo Huang , who is a billionaire real estate developer and casino high roller, was barred from Australia in 2018 on national security grounds. Alex Joske, a United Front expert and researcher with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that the All-China Federation of Returned Chinese Overseas — of which the Guangdong federations in Canada and Australia are a part — is an increasingly important part of Chinese President Xi’s United Front diaspora control strategy. Meeting of the World Guangdong Community Federation in Vancouver, run by the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, hampered by 200 (10%) of attendees failing to obtain visas. Are visa denials being used to push back against UF work? h/t @OGCDN  https://t.co/y2zgareQJw — Alex Joske (@alexjoske) May 24, 2018 Joske told Global News that China’s Communist Party uses organized crime and United Front groups for strategic uses abroad. “In Australia, we’ve observed overlap between political influence operations, intelligence agencies and organized crime,” Joske said. “For example, a gambling junket operator and alleged criminal figure who also runs groups that report back to the United Front Work Department and collect information on politicians.” Jonathan Manthorpe, a Canadian author and United Front expert, has reported that it is believed Ottawa blocked visas for 200 Guangdong federation officials seeking to visit Vancouver in 2018, based on national security grounds. However CSIS would not confirm to Global News whether it advised Ottawa to block the visas. In an interview, Manthorpe told Global News that Xi has vastly increased resources of the United Front, which Xi calls a “magic weapon.” “The United Front Works Department is, to put it very simply, a political warfare operation,” Manthorpe said. “It’s in all the embassies and consulates in Canada.” And United Front operatives seeded in Chinese consulates worldwide create and take over “seemingly innocuous groups, most of them embedded in ethnic Chinese communities not only in Canada but in all the countries where the Chinese diaspora of around 50 million people now live,” Manthorpe said. Manthorpe says a particularly troubling aspect of the United Front’s mass mobilization of Chinese immigrants for the collection of PPE is the Chinese Communist Party’s “ability to exert discipline and to demand patriotic loyalty.” “To me, it is utterly unconscionable that here are Canadians who are being intimidated and pressured in their own country by foreign agents,” Manthorpe said. “These are assaults on our sovereignty, and they are assaults on our national interest. And they are assaults on our citizens. We should not allow that.” However, Chinese officials have countered criticism that the country cornered the world’s PPE supply, claiming that after China has conquered its internal coronavirus threat, United Front groups including Guangdong Federation members are now distributing PPE to other countries and “overseas Chinese.” “It is understood that at present, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Federation is also actively coordinating a group of masks and other epidemic prevention materials to be donated to overseas Chinese groups in areas with severe epidemics in Italy, Spain, the United States, Peru, and the United Kingdom, hoping to relieve the current shortage of anti-epidemic materials for overseas Chinese,” a March 23 UFWD report says.   READ MORE: Canadian mayors may have unwittingly been targets of Chinese influence campaign   While United Front actors have been on CSIS’s radar since 1998, Manthorpe says, networks are growing rapidly in Canada under Xi’s regime. And the current threat level was encapsulated in a 2018 CSI S report that says: “The CCP’s United Front activities incorporate co-opting elites, information management, persuasion, as well as accessing strategic information and resources. It has also frequently been a means of facilitating espionage.” China does not acknowledge that its United Front is used for espionage, and Chinese consulates in Canada did not respond to questions for this story. John Townsend, CSIS’ head of media relations, would not directly answer whether the national security agency could be investigating the PPE export operations involving United Front groups in Canada, such as Canada Chao Shan. “Under our act, CSIS clearly has a mandate to investigate espionage and sabotage, terrorism, foreign interference, and subversion and we will continue to use our legal authorities to ensure the government of Canada receives intelligence on these critical issues,” he said.    © 2020 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

He says this will provide grocers with another private-sector option to keep their shelves stocked during the coronavirus pandemic.

""This is yet another example of the private sector stepping up and Texans helping Texans as we all work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in our state,"" said Governor Abbott. ""I thank the Texas Alcoholic and Beverage Commission for its assistance in this effort. By waiving these regulations, we are streamlining the process to replenish the shelves in grocery stores across the state. We are all in this together, and I want to remind all Texans that hoarding resources is neither necessary nor productive. Texas has the supplies to meet the needs of Texans, and we will continue to expedite the flow of groceries to stores across the state.""

The novel coronavirus has now killed more than 243,000 people worldwide.

Over 3.4 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.

Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the hardest-hit country, with more than 1.1 million diagnosed cases and at least 66,369 deaths.

10:54 p.m.: City drops mask requirement over fears of violence

The city of Stillwater, Oklahoma, has amended an emergency proclamation requiring people to wear face coverings in public after threats of violence.

In a statement, Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said that in three hours on May 1, while face coverings were mandatory inside stores in the city, employees were ""threatened with physical violence"" by people who ""cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional."" One person even threatened an employee with a gun for asking them to wear a mask, according to McNickle.

""It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk,"" McNickle said in a statement. ""As mentioned, there is clear medical evidence the face coverings prevent COVID-19 spread; they are recommended by both the CDC and the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The wearing of face coverings is little inconvenience to protect both the wearer and anyone with whom they have contact. And, an unprotected person who contracts the virus can infect their own loved ones and others.""

McNickle and Stillwater Mayor Will Joyce reversed the emergency proclamation late Friday. The city will still require store workers to wear masks, but with the amendment citizens are now just ""strongly encouraged"" to wear coverings, instead of requiring it.

Stillwater has a population of about 50,000, and is the location of Oklahoma State University. The university sent students home in mid-March and conducted classes online the rest of the semester.

9 p.m.: Hotel group to give back loan money

The Ashford Group will return the millions of dollars in coronavirus small business loans its real estate and hotel companies received under the Paycheck Protection Program, the company announced Saturday.

Together, its publicly traded companies received more -- tens of millions of dollars -- from the small business relief program than any other applicant.

As late as this week, they had resisted public pressure to return their funds. But on Saturday, said they would do so to comply with in new guidance from the Small Business Administration.

The group defended taking the loan even as it returned the money, ""Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied that Ashford accessed 'loopholes' in the CARES Act to qualify for the PPP funds. In fact, Congress designed the PPP to specifically allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property as a means to prevent the economic collapse of the hospitality industry that is now occurring.""

6:32 p.m.: US suffers deadliest days since outbreak began

America just confronted its deadliest two days in deaths since the country's first known novel coronavirus death in February.

April 30 and May 1 marked the deadliest 48 hours in the United States' fight against COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization.

A total of 4,978 people died, according to the WHO's situation reports, which detail the number of new and total COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide.

The reports, posted on May 1 and May 2, detail data reported to the Geneva-based organization by 4 a.m. ET Saturday.

The death toll in the U.S. is more than 66,000.

6:05 p.m.: Chicago mayor rails against house parties

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot held a fiery press conference Saturday asking people to immediately stop holding large house parties.

""If you feel like having a dance party -- go on TikTok,"" she said. ""You are risking your own health. ... You are bringing death to [your family's] doorstep.""

The Chicago Police Department vowed to shut down any large gatherings and arrest those in attendance.

The CPD will ""shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and take you to jail, period. There should be nothing unambiguous about that.""

Lightfoot said she had to call today’s presser because CPD has already broke up 50- and 150-person house parties, and they know more are planned tonight.

""For a silly party, you are risking first responders' lives,"" CPD Superintendent David Brown said, ""all of our lives, including first responders.""

5:08 p.m.: USNS Mercy no longer accepting new patients: FEMA

The USNS Mercy, which was docketed at the Port of Los Angeles to help assist medical professionals with treating COVID-19 patients, will not be accepting new patients, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The Navy hospital ship has been stationed at the harbor since March 27 and has treated just over 70 non-coronavirus patients, according to The Associated Press. It currently has nine patients on board.

Mercy's sister ship, the USNS Comfort, was deployed in New York Harbor since April 1 and left on Thursday. USNS Comfort treated 182 patients.

5 p.m.: Number of Maryland COVID-19 patients continues to rapidly rise

Maryland's confirmed coronavirus cases have climbed sharply this week, bringing its total to 24,473 cases.

Since Monday, confirmed cases of the virus have risen by almost 5,000. From Monday to Tuesday, there were 626 new cases, but from Thursday to Friday 1,730 additional cases were confirmed.

From Friday until midday Saturday 1,001 new cases were confirmed.

As of Saturday, Maryland has 1,156 coronavirus-related deaths.

3:03 p.m.: Tyson Foods plant set to reopen next week

After almost half of the 1,900 workers at a Tyson Fresh Meats plant in Logansport, Indiana, tested positive for COVID-19, the pork plant is slated to reopen next week.

The plant was temporarily shut down on April 25 after the cases were confirmed, according to a statement from the Indiana Joint Information Center.

Team members were asked to self-isolate until their results returned. The company is working with local health officials on verification of test results and will communicate with team members prior to the restart date, while following CDC guidance on safely returning employees back to work.

""While the facility was idled, we added more workstation barriers, installed more hand sanitizer dispensers, and did additional deep cleaning and sanitation,"" said Todd Neff, senior vice president pork. ""We’re also now screening employees for additional symptoms and designating monitors to help enforce social distancing, while following the CDC and OSHA’s guidance for Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers.""

Bonuses and health insurance coverage ha also increased for the workers.

Tyson Fresh Meats also temporarily halted operations at its Dakota City, Nebraska, beef plant for additional deep cleaning and sanitation. The group voluntarily idled its locations in Waterloo and Perry, Iowa, and Pasco, Washington, while team members undergo testing and plants complete deep cleanings of the facilities.

2:39 p.m.: Texas cases surpass 30,000

12:19 p.m.: US intel believes China hid severity of epidemic while stockpiling supplies

U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Chinese government misled the rest of the world about the contagiousness of COVID-19, all the while taking dramatic action to collect the medical supplies needed for its own battle against the virus, according to an analysis obtained by ABC News.

The report from the Department of Homeland Security claims that ""the Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of COVID-19 from the international community in early January while it stockpiled medical supplies by both increasing imports and decreasing exports.""

""China likely cut its exports of medical supplies prior to its January WHO notification that COVID-19 is a contagion,"" according to the report, which was shared with law enforcement and government agencies on Friday.

The analysis looked at official and media reporting of imports and exports, and it examined alternative theories that might explain the dramatic January shift in trade patterns connected with critical health care equipment. However, none of those alternatives seemed plausible to U.S. intelligence experts, who wrote in the report: ""The Chinese government attempted to hide its actions by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data.""

Global trade data from February showed ""a significant decline"" in worldwide imports from China, according to the report. For example, imports of surgical gowns declined by 71%, surgical face masks by 48%, medical ventilators by 45% and intubation kits by 56%.

The February figures likely reflected a January reduction in exports from China because cargo typically takes at least 30 days to ship, according to the report.

The Department of Homeland Security said in the report it has ""moderate confidence"" in its overall assessment, according to analysis of the trade data. The document also notes that ""in its communications, China intentionally concealed its trade activity by publicly denying it has ever imposed an export ban on masks and other medical supplies.""

Analysts reported U.S. intel does not have enough global trade information to find early evidence of a contagion, but, did say that with China producing about 80% of the world's supply of maks a ""stockpiling of face masks indicates a significant health concern.""

11:59 a.m.: Fewer New Yorkers testing positive for antibodies

The rate of New Yorkers who tested positive for antibodies, meaning they had COVID-19 at some point, has decreased, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing.

The percentage of residents who had antibodies was 12.3% as of May 1, down from 13.9% on April 22 and 14.9% on April 27, Cuomo said.

Around 15,000 people were tested in the survey, according to the governor, who touted it as the largest antibody survey in the country.

While he admitted that it was not a major decrease, it was ""better than seeing it go up.""

More men than women tested positive for antibodies, the results showed, and New York City continued to have the highest reported positive tests at 19.9%. In the city, the Bronx and Brooklyn had the two highest positive antibody results.

Cuomo said health experts still are trying to determine where new cases are coming from and have asked hospitals to record from neighborhoods new patients arrive. He's also asked hospitals to help identify how many new cases are front-line workers or people with whom they live.

Ahead of the subway's scheduled closure from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., starting May 6, officials discussed the logistics of the plan.

Sarah Feinberg, interim president of the New York City Transit, said that around 10,000 to 11,000 thousand people ride the subway from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. She said transit officials know which subway stations those people use and they're going to ramp up bus services so fewer commuters see disruptions.

10:53 a.m.: Tremendous' testing capacity for returning senators, Trump tweets

President Donald Trump said there is ""tremendous"" testing capacity for senators returning to Washington, D.C., next week. His comments came after it was reported that Capitol physician Brian Monahan said earlier in the week that his office did not have the capacity to screen all 100 senators.

""There is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday,"" Trump tweeted.

He also said that was ""likewise"" for the House, which he said should return but is not because of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The president said the five-minute Abbott test would be used. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced late Friday night on Twitter that the administration was sending Abbott tests to Congress.

""Good news: as the Senate reconvenes to do important work for the American people during this public health crisis, we have now received an initial request and are sending 3 Abbott point of care testing machines and 1,000 tests for their use,"" Azar tweeted.

10 a.m.: Fauci will testify before Senate

Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci will testify before the GOP-led Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on May 12, a committee spokesperson said.

""Chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander looks forward to hearing from Dr. Fauci and other administration officials at the Senate health committee's second hearing back, which will be on Tuesday, May 12,"" the spokesperson said.

The news comes after the White House's efforts to block Fauci from appearing before the Democratic-led House committee next week. The White House did not immediately respond to ABC News for comment.

6:45 a.m.: NCAA releases 'core principles' for restarting college sports

The NCAA released guidelines on Friday for how college sports will transition back campuses. Its plan closely follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Trump administration's Opening Up America Again strategy.

Once COVID-19 infection rates decrease for at least two weeks, the NCAA said ""resocialization of sport may be possible."" In its plan, put together by the COVID-19 Advisory Panel, there are nine ""core principles"" that are a part of three phases for college sports to come back.

""The core principles outlined below are offered as a premise for resuming practice and competition at the collegiate level,"" the NCAA said in a statement.

Some of the principles include that colleges must have a plan in place for students to come back, that there are adequate personal protective equipment and access to testing, there must be a surveillance program to trace and isolate new cases and more.

Phase one includes limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, keeping common areas like gyms and cafeterias closed and encouraging virtual-only meetings. Phase two includes a limit on gatherings of 50 people or more, but allows for nonessential travel to resume. After other safety benchmarks and coronavirus numbers are met, phase three allows vulnerable student-athlete to resume in-person activities, common areas open and most other restrictions are lifted.

The NCAA guidelines are all subject to federal, state and local regulations.

Since early March, all NCAA sports have been canceled, including the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournament.

4:10 a.m.: Mississippi extends stay-at-home order after spike in deaths

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said he was prepared to unveil the easing of state restrictions Friday. He said he knows the economy needs to be reopened and that residents of his state are ready to get back to work and see a normal way of life again. However, as he was set to announce those plans Friday during the state's task force briefing, the latest coronavirus data forced him to stop in his tracks.

Mississippi, he said, had just had its largest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases and its largest increase in deaths.

""Every single day, I have come before you and been transparent. I was transparent when I made decisions that turned out to be right. And I believe I was transparent when I made decisions that turned out to be wrong,"" he said Friday.

""This thing is not over, we are not out of the woods yet. Things can change quickly. We have to stay flexible,"" Reeves said during Friday's briefing. ""This was a large enough change to make me take a step back… and I have come to the conclusion that I must hold on for now.""

Reeves said he hopes to announce more reopenings soon, but the timing is not right. Meanwhile, the governor is in a battle with the state legislature over federal COVID-19 stimulus funding.

The legislature voted Friday to prevent Reeves' office from spending federal coronavirus money, saying the executive branch shouldn't be the sole decider on how to spend the CARES money in the state.

Reeves said that decision only delays getting much-needed funds to residents.

""Best case scenario, weeks from now, they start debating that budget. They over-estimate and we have to send a lot of your money back to the federal government when it goes unused,"" Reeves said in a statement Friday night. ""Worst case scenario, they underestimate and people die because we can't get them what they need.""

Mississippi has more than 7,200 diagnosed coronavirus cases and at least 281 deaths.

Wang Haibin/ROPI via ZUMA Press The novel coronavirus has now killed more than 243,000 people worldwide. Over 3.4 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks. Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the hardest-hit country, with more than 1.1 million diagnosed cases and at least 66,369 deaths.

All times Eastern.  10:54 p.m.: City drops mask requirement over fears of violence The city of Stillwater, Oklahoma, has amended an emergency proclamation requiring people to wear face coverings in public after threats of violence. In a statement, Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said that in three hours on May 1, while face coverings were mandatory inside stores in the city, employees were ""threatened with physical violence"" by people who ""cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional."" One person even threatened an employee with a gun for asking them to wear a mask, according to McNickle. ""It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk,"" McNickle said in a statement. ""As mentioned, there is clear medical evidence the face coverings prevent COVID-19 spread; they are recommended by both the CDC and the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The wearing of face coverings is little inconvenience to protect both the wearer and anyone with whom they have contact. And, an unprotected person who contracts the virus can infect their own loved ones and others."" McNickle and Stillwater Mayor Will Joyce reversed the emergency proclamation late Friday. The city will still require store workers to wear masks, but with the amendment citizens are now just ""strongly encouraged"" to wear coverings, instead of requiring it. Stillwater has a population of about 50,000, and is the location of Oklahoma State University. The university sent students home in mid-March and conducted classes online the rest of the semester.

So did the investment trusts that own them As late as this week, they had resisted public pressure to return their funds. But on Saturday, said they would do so to comply with in new guidance from the Small Business Administration. The group defended taking the loan even as it returned the money, ""Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied that Ashford accessed 'loopholes' in the CARES Act to qualify for the PPP funds. In fact, Congress designed the PPP to specifically allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property as a means to prevent the economic collapse of the hospitality industry that is now occurring."" 6:32 p.m.: US suffers deadliest days since outbreak began America just confronted its deadliest two days in deaths since the country's first known novel coronavirus death in February.

Team members were asked to self-isolate until their results returned. The company is working with local health officials on verification of test results and will communicate with team members prior to the restart date, while following CDC guidance on safely returning employees back to work. ""While the facility was idled, we added more workstation barriers, installed more hand sanitizer dispensers, and did additional deep cleaning and sanitation,"" said Todd Neff, senior vice president pork. ""We’re also now screening employees for additional symptoms and designating monitors to help enforce social distancing, while following the CDC and OSHA’s guidance for Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers."" Bonuses and health insurance coverage ha also increased for the workers.

David Santiago/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images 12:19 p.m.: US intel believes China hid severity of epidemic while stockpiling supplies U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Chinese government misled the rest of the world about the contagiousness of COVID-19, all the while taking dramatic action to collect the medical supplies needed for its own battle against the virus, according to an analysis obtained by ABC News. The report from the Department of Homeland Security claims that ""the Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of COVID-19 from the international community in early January while it stockpiled medical supplies by both increasing imports and decreasing exports."" ""China likely cut its exports of medical supplies prior to its January WHO notification that COVID-19 is a contagion,"" according to the report, which was shared with law enforcement and government agencies on Friday. The analysis looked at official and media reporting of imports and exports, and it examined alternative theories that might explain the dramatic January shift in trade patterns connected with critical health care equipment. However, none of those alternatives seemed plausible to U.S. intelligence experts, who wrote in the report: ""The Chinese government attempted to hide its actions by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data.""

Workers make face masks in a company in Qingdao in east China's Shandong province Monday, April 27, 2020. Wang Haibin/ROPI via ZUMA Press Global trade data from February showed ""a significant decline"" in worldwide imports from China, according to the report. For example, imports of surgical gowns declined by 71%, surgical face masks by 48%, medical ventilators by 45% and intubation kits by 56%. The February figures likely reflected a January reduction in exports from China because cargo typically takes at least 30 days to ship, according to the report. The Department of Homeland Security said in the report it has ""moderate confidence"" in its overall assessment, according to analysis of the trade data. The document also notes that ""in its communications, China intentionally concealed its trade activity by publicly denying it has ever imposed an export ban on masks and other medical supplies."" Analysts reported U.S. intel does not have enough global trade information to find early evidence of a contagion, but, did say that with China producing about 80% of the world's supply of maks a ""stockpiling of face masks indicates a significant health concern."" 11:59 a.m.: Fewer New Yorkers testing positive for antibodies The rate of New Yorkers who tested positive for antibodies, meaning they had COVID-19 at some point, has decreased, Gov.

https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2020/04/04/nevada-governor-found-hoarding-hydroxychloroquine-after-restricting-access-to-the-drug-n2566360,"Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak, Democrat, had a kneejerk reaction to President Trump's optimism about a malaria drug that might be an effective treatment for the Wuhan coronavirus. Trump was hopeful about the drug, so anti-Trump Democrats like Sisolak were against it. Gov. Sisolak banned (hydroxy)chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, ostensibly over concern of hoarders stockpiling the medicine and causing shortages for patients who use the drug for other ailments like Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. But while the governor restricted the public from receiving the potentially life-saving drug, Nevada's Department of Corrections began stockpiling the drug for prisoners.

(Via 360 News Las Vegas)

According to sources at the drug maker, Concordia Pharmaceuticals Inc, Nevada prisons ordered a large number of their anti-malaria Hydroxychloroquine drug under the name, Plaquenli. Nevada prisons has literally ZERO cases of prisoners infected with the COVID 19 virus to date. The Nevada Board of Pharmacies and the Governor claimed the rule barring doctors from prescribing the drug outside of hospitals was to stop hoarding. After Sisolak’s ban went into effect, the State Prison hoarded the drug in a mass just in case they had break out. Gov. Sisolak refused to reverse his order even after the FDA issued an emergency order earlier this week approving the drug for use against COVID 19.

Unbelievable. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is no better. When reports that (hydroxy)chloroquine showed promising signs as a safe treatment for the coronavirus, and after President Trump expressed his optimism over the drug's efficacy, Whitmer moved immediately to block Michiganders from gaining access to the potentially life-saving treatment. Both governors cited concerns over shortages, but alternative medicines are available to treat lupus. And if they haven't noticed, we're kind of in the middle of a pandemic.",

During 24 days in Cheonan, South Korea, 112 persons were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 associated with fitness dance classes at 12 sports facilities. Intense physical exercise in densely populated sports facilities could increase risk for infection. Vigorous exercise in confined spaces should be minimized during outbreaks.

By April 30, 2020, South Korea had reported 10,765 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (1); ≈76.2% of cases were from Daegu and North Gyeongsang provinces. On February 25, a COVID-19 case was detected in Cheonan, a city ≈200 km from Daegu. In response, public health and government officials from Cheonan and South Chungcheong Province activated the emergency response system. We began active surveillance and focused on identifying possible COVID-19 cases and contacts. We interviewed consecutive confirmed cases and found all had participated in a fitness dance class. We traced contacts back to a nationwide fitness dance instructor workshop that was held on February 15 in Cheonan.

Fitness dance classes set to Latin rhythms have gained popularity in South Korea because of the high aerobic intensity (2). At the February 15 workshop, instructors trained intensely for 4 hours. Among 27 instructors who participated in the workshop, 8 had positive real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes COVID-19; 6 were from Cheonan and 1 was from Daegu, which had the most reported COVID-19 cases in South Korea. All were asymptomatic on the day of the workshop.

By March 9, we identified 112 COVID-19 cases associated with fitness dance classes in 12 different sports facilities in Cheonan (Figure). All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR; 82 (73.2%) were symptomatic and 30 (26.8%) were asymptomatic at the time of laboratory confirmation. Instructors with very mild symptoms, such as coughs, taught classes for ≈1 week after attending the workshop (Appendix). The instructors and students met only during classes, which lasted for 50 minutes 2 times per week, and did not have contact outside of class. On average, students developed symptoms 3.5 days after participating in a fitness dance class (3). Most (50.9%) cases were the result of transmission from instructors to fitness class participants; 38 cases (33.9%) were in-family transmission from instructors and students; and 17 cases (15.2%) were from transmission during meetings with coworkers or acquaintances.

Among 54 fitness class students with confirmed COVID-19, the median age was 42, all were women, and 10 (18.5%) had preexisting medical conditions (Appendix Table 1). The most common symptom at the time of admission for isolation was cough in 44.4% (24/54) of cases; 17 (31.5%) case-patients had pneumonia. The median time to discharge or end of isolation was 27.6 (range 13–66) days after symptom onset.

Before sports facilities were closed, a total of 217 students were exposed in 12 facilities, an attack rate of 26.3% (95% CI 20.9%–32.5%) (Appendix Table 2). Including family and coworkers, transmissions from the instructors accounted for 63 cases (Appendix Figure 2). We followed up on 830 close contacts of fitness instructors and students and identified 34 cases of COVID-19, translating to a secondary attack rate of 4.10% (95% CI 2.95%–5.67%). We identified 418 close contacts of 34 tertiary transmissions before the quarantine and confirmed 10 quaternary cases from the tertiary cases, translating to a tertiary attack rate of 2.39% (95% CI 1.30%–4.35%).

The instructor from Daegu who attended the February 15 workshop had symptoms develop on February 18 and might have been presymptomatic during the workshop. Evidence of transmission from presymptomatic persons has been shown in epidemiologic investigations of COVID-19 (4,5).

Characteristics that might have led to transmission from the instructors in Cheonan include large class sizes, small spaces, and intensity of the workouts. The moist, warm atmosphere in a sports facility coupled with turbulent air flow generated by intense physical exercise can cause more dense transmission of isolated droplets (6,7). Classes from which secondary COVID-19 cases were identified included 5–22 students in a room ≈60 m2 during 50 minutes of intense exercise. We did not identify cases among classes with <5 participants in the same space. Of note, instructor C taught Pilates and yoga for classes of 7–8 students in the same facility at the same time as instructor B (Figure; Appendix Table 2), but none of her students tested positive for the virus. We hypothesize that the lower intensity of Pilates and yoga did not cause the same transmission effects as those of the more intense fitness dance classes.

A limitation of our study is the unavailability of a complete roster of visitors to the sports facilities, which might have meant we missed infections among students during surveillance and investigation efforts. Discovery of outbreak cases centered on exercise facilities led to a survey of instructors who participated in a fitness dance workshop and provided clues to identifying additional cases among students. Early identification of asymptomatic persons with RT-PCR–confirmed infections helped block further transmissions. Because of the increased possibility of infection through droplets, vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be avoided (8) during the current outbreak, as should public gatherings, even in small groups (9,10).","                        Skip directly to site content  Skip directly to page options  Skip directly to A-Z link  Skip directly to A-Z link  Skip directly to A-Z link         Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Intense physical exercise in densely populated sports facilities could increase risk for infection. Vigorous exercise in confined spaces should be minimized during outbreaks.     By April 30, 2020, South Korea had reported 10,765 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ( 1 ); ≈76.2% of cases were from Daegu and North Gyeongsang provinces. On February 25, a COVID-19 case was detected in Cheonan, a city ≈200 km from Daegu. In response, public health and government officials from Cheonan and South Chungcheong Province activated the emergency response system. We began active surveillance and focused on identifying possible COVID-19 cases and contacts. We interviewed consecutive confirmed cases and found all had participated in a fitness dance class. We traced contacts back to a nationwide fitness dance instructor workshop that was held on February 15 in Cheonan.  Fitness dance classes set to Latin rhythms have gained popularity in South Korea because of the high aerobic intensity ( 2 ). At the February 15 workshop, instructors trained intensely for 4 hours.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-25/coronavirus-cruise-ship-quarantine-zone-for-rottnest-island/12089394,"WA Premier Mark McGowan is ""exercising the Rottnest option now"" to quarantine Australian cruise ship passengers set to disembark in Perth, as two other vessels have been prevented from docking.

Key points: Rottnest will be used to quarantine 800 Australian passengers for 14 days

Rottnest will be used to quarantine 800 Australian passengers for 14 days Two cruise ships are being kept offshore with one reporting illness

Two cruise ships are being kept offshore with one reporting illness WA has recorded 30 new cases of coronavirus, bringing its total to 205

Australians on board the Vasco da Gama cruise ship due to arrive at Fremantle Port on Friday will be taken to the holiday island off Perth's coast and required to self-isolate for two weeks.

""All Australians, including the West Australians, will be immediately transferred to Rottnest Island for 14 days of self-isolation,"" he said.

""In the last two days we have cleared the island of visitors and made arrangements for accommodation, catering and security.

""We are exercising the Rottnest option now.""

The Vasco da Gama is carrying 950 passengers and 550 crew and there are 800 Australians on board, including 200 West Australians.

Three Rottnest ferry companies will be used to transport the Australian passengers to the island in small groups.

Mr McGowan said two other cruise ships, the Artania and the Magnifica, were being prevented from docking at Fremantle Port and had been told to anchor offshore, with illness reported on board the Artania.

""Those two ships need to go home, they need to leave and go home,"" he said.

Internationals to be kept on board Vasco da Gama

The Government said it believed there were 109 New Zealanders on board the Vasco da Gama and the remaining passengers were from other countries, including 33 from the United Kingdom.

""We are currently determining with the Commonwealth if some of the international passengers are in fact permanent residents of Australia,"" Mr McGowan said.

""Fremantle is the final port of call for this cruise ship as it has always been the plan for passengers to disembark in Fremantle.

""All crew and foreign nationals will remain on the ship until arrangements are made to fly them directly out of the country.

""They will not be allowed to disembark at any time unless it is to travel under strict supervision directly to the airport, or they need urgent medical attention to survive.

""Passengers who need to travel home to New Zealand will also remain on the ship and a plan is being worked up with the New Zealand Government to get those passengers back home as safely as possible.""

Cruise ship says it received no warning

Vasco de Gama operator Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV) said it received no warning of the WA Government's decision.

""We would like to express our disappointment that the WA Premier did not inform us of this decision before sharing this news with the public, and that we were unable to inform our passengers before it appeared in media reports,"" CMV Australia managing director Dean Brazier said.

Mr Brazier said there were no reported health issues on board the cruise ship and passengers would have been at sea for almost two weeks straight when they arrived in Fremantle.

""Our guests will have been at sea for 13 days straight without disembarking the ship or being in contact with anyone who was not a guest or crew member of CMV,"" he said.

""We are disappointed that they will now have to wait a further 14 days until they can return home.""

Phuket in Thailand was the last place the Vasco da Garna visited before starting its journey back to its home port of Fremantle.

Artania cruise ship reports illness offshore

WA authorities are providing assistance to the Artania after it approached Fremantle to refuel but was told to anchor off the coast.

Mr McGowan said about 25 passengers and crew on board the vessel were reporting respiratory symptoms.

The Premier said one passenger who was no longer on the ship had tested positive to COVID-19 after disembarking.

""Last night the ship requested assistance with health assessments and COVID-19 testing,"" Mr McGowan said.

""Health Department officials are now on board providing medical checks and testing. We will receive that advice later today.""

There are more than 800 passengers and 500 crew on board but none of the passengers are Australian.

Magnifica returns to Fremantle

The Magnifica left Fremantle yesterday carrying mainly European tourists after making a brief refuelling stop en route to Dubai.

But overnight the Dubai Government told the ship it would not be allowed to dock in the country, forcing it to turn back to WA.

The Magnifica cruise ship is now anchored off WA after being turned away from Dubai. ( ABC News: Fiona Blackwood )

""We continue to deal with the fast moving and internationally complex issue around cruise ship arrivals in Fremantle,"" Mr McGowan said.

""I will not allow what has happened in Sydney to happen here in Western Australia … It was a complete and utter disaster.

""There are no circumstances where we will allow passengers or crew to wander the streets in our state.""

He said the Federal Government had been asked for ""immediate assistance"" regarding both the Artemia and the Magnifica.

WA coronavirus total tops 200

A further 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in WA, taking the state's total tally to 205.

The latest victims are aged between 21 and 80, and eight are from regional WA, with four in the South West, one in the Kimberley, one in the Wheatbelt, one in the Great Southern and one in the Pilbara.

Mr McGowan said about one in four confirmed cases in WA had been linked to cruise ships.

""What is so concerning is that an increasing number of confirmed cases in Western Australia can be traced back to cruise ships,"" he said.

""I am not going to take any chances on this issue. My number one priority is protecting our citizens here in our state.""

Health Minister Roger Cook said five of the latest 30 cases were passengers from cruise ships.

""This takes the total number of COVID-19 positives who [were] passengers on a cruise ship to 47,"" Mr Cook said.

Mr Cook said two children who were confirmed to have the virus yesterday were both well and self-isolating at home with their families.

McGowan wary of 'Ruby Princess disaster'

Mr McGowan said the Government was exercising the Rottnest quarantine option for two reasons after clearing the island of tourists.

Key points: Rottnest will be used to quarantine 800 Australian passengers for 14 days Two cruise ships are being kept offshore with one reporting illness WA has recorded 30 new cases of coronavirus, bringing its total to 205 Australians on board the Vasco da Gama cruise ship due to arrive at Fremantle Port on Friday will be taken to the holiday island off Perth's coast and required to self-isolate for two weeks. ""All Australians, including the West Australians, will be immediately transferred to Rottnest Island for 14 days of self-isolation,"" he said. ""In the last two days we have cleared the island of visitors and made arrangements for accommodation, catering and security. ""We are exercising the Rottnest option now."" Coronavirus update: Follow all the latest news in our daily wrap. The Vasco da Gama is carrying 950 passengers and 550 crew and there are 800 Australians on board,  including 200 West Australians. Three Rottnest ferry companies will be used to transport the Australian passengers to the island in small groups. Mr McGowan said two other cruise ships, the Artania and the Magnifica, were being prevented from docking at Fremantle Port and had been told to anchor offshore, with illness reported on board the Artania.  The Artania is anchored off Fremantle and has requested help to test for coronavirus. ( ABC News: Rob Koenig-Luck ) ""Those two ships need to go home, they need to leave and go home,"" he said. Internationals to be kept on board Vasco da Gama The Government said it believed there were 109 New Zealanders on board the Vasco da Gama and the remaining passengers were from other countries, including 33 from the United Kingdom.  The Vasco da Gama is due to arrive at Fremantle Port on Friday. ( ABC News: Tom Fedorowytsch ) ""We are currently determining with the Commonwealth if some of the international passengers are in fact permanent residents of Australia,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Fremantle is the final port of call for this cruise ship as it has always been the plan for passengers to disembark in Fremantle. ""All crew and foreign nationals will remain on the ship until arrangements are made to fly them directly out of the country. Stay up-to-date on the coronavirus outbreak Download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest on how the pandemic is impacting the world ""They will not be allowed to disembark at any time unless it is to travel under strict supervision directly to the airport, or they need urgent medical attention to survive. ""Passengers who need to travel home to New Zealand will also remain on the ship and a plan is being worked up with the New Zealand Government to get those passengers back home as safely as possible."" Cruise ship says it received no warning Vasco de Gama operator Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV) said it received no warning of the WA Government's decision. ""We would like to express our disappointment that the WA Premier did not inform us of this decision before sharing this news with the public, and that we were unable to inform our passengers before it appeared in media reports,"" CMV Australia managing director Dean Brazier said.  The Vasco da Gama is due to arrive at Fremantle Port on Friday. ( ABC News ) Mr Brazier said there were no reported health issues on board the cruise ship and passengers would have been at sea for almost two weeks straight when they arrived in Fremantle. ""Our guests will have been at sea for 13 days straight without disembarking the ship or being in contact with anyone who was not a guest or crew member of CMV,"" he said. ""We are disappointed that they will now have to wait a further 14 days until they can return home."" Phuket in Thailand was the last place the Vasco da Garna visited before starting its journey back to its home port of Fremantle. Artania cruise ship reports illness offshore WA authorities are providing assistance to the Artania after it approached Fremantle to refuel but was told to anchor off the coast. Mr McGowan said about 25 passengers and crew on board  the vessel were reporting respiratory symptoms. Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume.

""Last night the ship requested assistance with health assessments and COVID-19 testing,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Health Department officials are now on board providing medical checks and testing. We will receive that advice later today."" There are more than 800 passengers and 500 crew on board but none of the passengers are Australian. Magnifica returns to Fremantle The Magnifica left Fremantle yesterday carrying mainly European tourists after making a brief refuelling stop en route to Dubai . But overnight the Dubai Government told the ship it would not be allowed to dock in the country, forcing it to turn back to WA.  The Magnifica cruise ship is now anchored off WA after being turned away from Dubai. ( ABC News: Fiona Blackwood ) ""We continue to deal with the fast moving and internationally complex issue around cruise ship arrivals in Fremantle,"" Mr McGowan said. ""I will not allow what has happened in Sydney to happen here in Western Australia …  It was a complete and utter disaster. ""There are no circumstances where we will allow passengers or crew to wander the streets in our state."" He said the Federal Government had been asked for ""immediate assistance"" regarding both the Artemia and the Magnifica. WA coronavirus total tops 200 A further 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in WA, taking the state's total tally to 205. WA COVID-19 snapshot Confirmed cases so far: 611 Recovered: 598 Deaths: 9 Total tests: 191,213 Latest information from the WA Health Department The latest victims are aged between 21 and 80, and eight are from regional WA, with four in the South West, one in the Kimberley, one in the Wheatbelt, one in the Great Southern and one in the Pilbara. Mr McGowan said about one in four confirmed cases in WA had been linked to cruise ships. ""What is so concerning is that an increasing number of confirmed cases in Western Australia can be traced back to cruise ships,"" he said. ""I am not going to take any chances on this issue. My number one priority is protecting our citizens here in our state."" Your questions on coronavirus answered: Will Australia have a second wave of coronavirus? How many people have died from coronavirus? Can children pass on the coronavirus disease? Health Minister Roger Cook said five of the latest 30 cases were passengers from cruise ships. ""This takes the total number of COVID-19 positives who [were] passengers on a cruise ship to 47,"" Mr Cook said. Mr Cook said two children who were confirmed to have the virus yesterday were both well and self-isolating at home with their families.

In an update earlier this week, a Nintendo spokesperson told Polygon the company's latest fitness video game was ""selling out"" across North America.

the Ring Fit Adventure game is selling out at various retail locations in the Americas. We are working to provide more units as soon as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.

This small update for this region follows on from the news last month that sales for the exercise game had rapidly increased in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. At the time, Chinese resellers were buying out any stock they could get their hands on in huge quantities and then selling it well above the retail price. It probably didn't help that it wasn't officially available in the country at the time, either.

Ring Fit Adventure stock shortages have also been reported elsewhere since COVID-19 has swept the globe. At the company's most recent financial results briefing in January, president Shuntaro Furukawa formally apologised for the worldwide shortages and inconvenience. As of 31st January 2020, Ring Fit Adventure's cumulative sellthrough has exceeded 1.7 million units.

I might drop by and give it a purchase, as the fever has only just taken over our consciousness   1     12 frogopus Sun 15th Mar 2020   I went on a hunt for it a couple weeks ago. It was sold out everywhere except one obscure Gamestop a half hour away that looked like it was the last business in a strip mall of failed and closed businesses, hanging on for dear life with no customers inside. They had a few. I'm not that into it, but the kids like it. The ring is better than I expected but the core game isn't as good as I expected.   1     13 Beatley82 Sun 15th Mar 2020   Wow, unlike Nintendo to not have enough stock.   6     14 Ralizah Sun 15th Mar 2020   lol I'm glad I got mine this last Christmas.   2     15 Tandy255 Sun 15th Mar 2020   I love the game, but wish we could download it digitally. I don’t want to swap out the cart for my daily exercise routine (right now I am swapping it out with LM3).    4     16 Tandy255 Sun 15th Mar 2020   I haven’t lost weight with Ring Fit (I need to work on my eating habits), but I am in much better shape and better flexibility.   6     17 boxyguy Sun 15th Mar 2020   makes me glad i got the last box my store had, hoping to play more of it tomorrow   2     18 Xenomorth Sun 15th Mar 2020   I think its because a lot of them were sold during Christmas and in fisrt day of new year,now they cant keep it up,Nintendo just isn't able to fill the gap. Overall bad news   1     19 romanista Sun 15th Mar 2020   Got in at launch, since i had to recover from hip injury.. so now the rhytm.. monday rijg fit... Tuesday zwift (cycling game, with you race cycle connected to your computer or ipad), wednesday Wii Fit U. And repeat.    1     20 MajinSoul Sun 15th Mar 2020   Well, I'm glad I bought it Day-One. Great game   2     21 tech7 Sun 15th Mar 2020   Never seen one in store.   0     22 Link41x Sun 15th Mar 2020   I was hoping my local Toys R' Us had any left but alas they did not   1     23 JasmineDragon Sun 15th Mar 2020   This game got so lucky with its timing. It went from being a very niche product to a must-have item in everyone's quarantine toolbox. Too bad Nintendo can't keep the stock flowing. I'm glad I got mine early. I've been playing for a couple of months now and it's been very good for me.   4     24 bigcalsworld Sun 15th Mar 2020   I finally started a diet in Feb and was using the Wii to help me with some exercise. Decided I was gonna get Ring Fit Adventure for Switch... aaaaand it was sold out. And has been ever since lol. By the time its back in stock (and at regular price...) I'll have no need for it!   2     25 tendonerd Sun 15th Mar 2020   Once I got done with it, I went back to my regular workout. I notice my body was getting out of shape doing Ring Fit. Sure it will get you fit, but if you're already better than fit, you better keep doing what you were doing. When they started rehashing the same courses with palette swaps, that's when I started getting bored of the game. When they had a world full of boss fights and nothing else, the game was a bore. With that said, I still enjoyed like 80% of the game, just not enough to go through it a second time when my body was going from daily workout shape to Ring Fit shape.   2     26 Scott_PdP Sun 15th Mar 2020   I got it for Christmas and still play most mornings. If they can create a sequel with combat or capturing things or multiplayer anything, I'll never stop. I'm 50 years old and I love being able to customize my workout based on which part of my body doesn't work on any given morning.   3     27 HAL9000 Sun 15th Mar 2020   I am so glad that I bought Ring Fit on launch! It is a REAL WORKOUT and fits in great with pools being closed for these 2 weeks to combat coronavirus   2     28 JayJ Sun 15th Mar 2020   This is a great game for people right now since so many are trapped at home with everything being shut down.   1     29 FatHedgehog Sun 15th Mar 2020   I’m trying my luck with Fitness Boxing tonight since I can’t find it anywhere and am not stepping foot in a gym right now.   1     30 Erchitu Sun 15th Mar 2020   I really want this game. I am just waiting to have the money.   1     31 TimboSlice Sun 15th Mar 2020   @Anti-Matter with the great sales, let’s hope for just a substantive update and/or paid DLC.   2     32 Vicki_S Sun 15th Mar 2020   My parents bought it for me for Christmas, so I’m good. Also have all the Wii Fit and Wii Sports games. Add that to lifting boxes of various sizes/weights and climbing ladders 5 days a week    1     33 Anjuvena Sun 15th Mar 2020   If the stupid Scalpers didn’t buy all the copies that would be nice. I was planning to buy it with my tax return and then find out it’s been sold out everywhere the entire time I’ve had it. So frustrating.   1     34 siavm Sun 15th Mar 2020   With gyms becoming unsafe. And getting large exercise equipment probably harder this sounds like a easy indoor solution. I wish I would have got one. I might just though if I can find it in the next crazy weeks.   1     35 westman98 Sun 15th Mar 2020   @Beatley82  The difference is that Ring Fit Adventure was widely available at launch last year everywhere outside of Japan, but has only now become supply constrained due to Covid-19 heightening the demand for in-home exercise products.   2     36 Anjuvena Sun 15th Mar 2020   @westman98 I personally was waiting for tax return to purchase it and the. This crazy happened and now I can’t because people are idiots.   2     37 mesome713 Sun 15th Mar 2020   This is the best exercising game ever made. Nintendo I don't know how you do it, yall truly are the best and most diverse developers ever known to man.   3     38 Dualmask Sun 15th Mar 2020   Just got my copy not too long ago, my body was NOT ready for this thing. The workout is really effective.   2     39 MrSec84 Sun 15th Mar 2020   It's not just America, I'm from the UK and even before Covid-19 was starting to have it's effects on the world Ring Fit was out of stock since it launched.  The only places you can get it are either Amazon UK's market place with independent sellers selling it for well over £100 or on Ebay, with similar mark ups or fakes. I would really like it, but I'm not paying more than £64.99, which is what most retailers would be charging if stock issues weren't a problem.  Nintendo needs to send UK retailers q bunch of stock, as well as the rest of the world, they'll sell them easily. I can't believe they can be having so much trouble making Ringcons and Leg Straps for the Joycons. Other games seem to have plenty of stock of game cards, this should be selling to a high percentage of Switch owners or new buyers at this time.    2     40 FatHedgehog Mon 16th Mar 2020   I ended up buying Fitness Boxing. If looking for a temporary fix, you could do far, far worse.   2     41 KingBowser Mon 16th Mar 2020   What else are people going to do? Walmart cuts their 24-hour stores today for people who likely work that long. Staffers are telling them if they are sick, they should stay home. Especially if those who are quarantined to their homes. Ring Fit Adventure will have you stay fit while you are homebound for the time being.   1     42 KingBowser Mon 16th Mar 2020   And probably also why they can't get enough of that muscular dragon   1     43 SkullDragr Mon 16th Mar 2020   It's going for over $200 on ebay. I like it, but I'm listing mine immediately. I can buy it again in a few months when it's back and get a couple more games along with it.   1     44 Smug43 Mon 16th Mar 2020   i'm pretty sure Nintendo underestimated the demand for it in Japan itself. That's where it all started and its' compounded because of all the other regions. This thing is on FIRE!!! I really want it but haven't gotten a chance to look for it. I doubt I could find one.   1     45 JSDude1 Mon 16th Mar 2020   This is the new “Amiibo” or “NES/SNES Classic”’craze.   1     46 JSDude1 Mon 16th Mar 2020   @Tandy255 how would that even work, you need the ring and leg wrap to use it (at least you need ring).   1     47 Tandy255 Mon 16th Mar 2020   @JSDude1 The easiest way would be to sell the attachments with a download code. Japan has this option: https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/ring_fit_adventure_file_size_revealed_download_code_version_also_available    0     48 KingBowser86 Mon 16th Mar 2020   I'm on Difficulty 26 and in the latter part of the first run of the game, and it is wearing me out after about an hour of movement-time. I'm certain now that the early reviewers who said that this wasn't a good workout did not (have the chance to?) play long enough.  If anyone at Nintendo reads comments for feedback (LOL): 1. Get Mountain Climbing and Planks to respond correctly, and, 2. Modify the Dreadmill speed to where the second speed keeps your exact place on the treadmill.  If you are considering buying the game and are concerned by those, don't be - you can work around #1 (by tricking the motion sensor for the gym challenges and selecting other exercises for your arsenal), and #2 only affects some sidequests that dole out some lousy items in exchange for perfection.    1     49 Hrimfaksi Mon 16th Mar 2020   @Anti-Matter why though? It's literally a runner game.... you do run for the express reason of running. What would you gain from running in different direction? How do you even make a training game, where you don't control what person is doing? You have to have encounters in specific order and frequency to train different group of muscles.   1     50 PALversusNTSC Mon 16th Mar 2020   Damn i missed the boat. Wish i bought 10 of them could have made good money, like i did with the mini snes.   0     51 pinta_vodki Mon 16th Mar 2020   Yeah.. I've been trying to buy it, but it's been sold out here in Russia for a good few months. And sadly I'm not sure if we're getting any more soon, since we're not a priority market for the big N, to put it lightly.   1     52 Dr_Awkward Mon 16th Mar 2020   @Chlocean Would you be willing to pick one up and ship it to me? I'd pay you in advance and throw in something for your trouble...   1     53 Chlocean Tue 17th Mar 2020   @Dr_Awkward Actually I can do that. How should I contact you?   0     54 Chlocean Tue 17th Mar 2020   @Dr_Awkward There are actually about 8 copies in Target right now. I could feasibly help you with that.   0     55 Dr_Awkward Tue 17th Mar 2020   @Chlocean if you're willing to, I'd make it worth your while. Do you have a reddit account, or a way to contact you?  If you have a Reddit, I'm u/Dr--Awkward    0     56 Anjuvena Wed 18th Mar 2020   @Chlocean dude I would be willing to pay you as well. Reasonably of course. And also I am on reddit u/anjuvena   0     57 dhc284 Wed 18th Mar 2020   @Chlocean Is there any way you can help me out as well? Happy to pay for it plus shipping and a little extra for your trouble!   0     58 Chlocean Wed 18th Mar 2020   @dhc284 I might be able to help with that, Do you have a reddit account, or is thete some other way to contact you?   0     59 dhc284 Wed 18th Mar 2020   @Chlocean yep! you can hit me up on reddit at thedannychang thank you!   0     60 pdominian Fri 20th Mar 2020   @Chlocean I would pay you (including the shipping cost) if you can deliver to international. My country (Malaysia) is selling it at 200usd   0     61 thomasqbrady Thu 2nd Apr 2020   @chlocean I would love a copy, too, if you picked those up and have a spare. I’m thomasqbrady on Reddit.   0     62 Chlocean Fri 3rd Apr 2020   @thomasqbrady We're all sold out now, sorry!   0   Tap here to load 62 comments     Leave A Comment   Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...

These scenarios range from being on sets for countless hours to camping on an offsite shooting location and well, the present day: A self-quarantined milieu.

In an email interview with GQ, Hrithik Roshan, who’s also the proud co-owner of HRX, an activewear brand, tells us that he's curated a new home workout routine for himself to stay fit and pumped. In fact, gym or no gym, there's no stopping him! “A gym where you find the motivation of watching others, equipment for all kinds of muscle groups is great. But the bottom line is if you have to work out, and there is no gym, then we follow the mantra that one does not need a gym to workout . I mean just the floor can be enough if you do a little search on all possible floor exercises! So no excuses.”

Hrithik Roshan’s new home workout routine:

“I am a believer in making the best of whatever situation you are in. These days I do a yoga stretching routine in the morning. Which takes about an hour. And my evening workout is circuit training combining 5-6 exercises which have weights, functional all included. My usual workout is a combination of strength training, cardio and weights. HRX workout is a derivative of my routine yes and it’s a part of my regime too.”

Keeping anxiety under control during the COVID-19 Pandemic (1:48)

March 18, 2020 - 3:30 pm EST

I’m used to walking 10,000 steps a day. Before I even get to the office, I’ve clocked at least 2 miles on foot. I live in New York City, where exercise is usually an afterthought because life is made up of being on the go. Now, with most state officials urging Americans to work from home, my step counter blinks at me like a sad puppy wondering why we’re not going on walks anymore. I’m in need of some serious inspiration for free indoor exercises to do, and I know I’m not alone.

RELATED: Subscribe to the Dr. Oz newsletter for wellness tips, recipes, and exclusive sneak peeks from The Dr. Oz Show.

If I’m going to do something other than walk, I like to workout at home anyway — even in my 650 square foot apartment. There’s something about getting to sweat freely with no one watching and being just inches away from my own shower that truly motivates me to get moving. Here are a few free things you can do now that will help keep your body moving and hopefully get you out of your headspace for a while. The key is to mix it up and try something new.

1. Yoga

Anyone who’s ever tried working out through YouTube can tell you that there are endless free yoga videos online. Yoga is particularly useful during a work-from-home or quarantine period because it can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and can even change the grey matter in your brain, according to Sharecare, which may help reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The breathing techniques you learn in yoga are very meditative, and usually are matched to movements. This means your brain has little to no time to focus on anything else besides what you’re doing.

Think about fitting in yoga where you’d normally fit in your commute to and from work. Dr. Oz does a 7-minute yoga routine every morning that you can start today, no matter what your skill level is.

2. Learn Choreography

A lot of people may find dancing to be totally humiliating in public, but when you’re in the comfort of your own living room, anything goes. Popsugar Fitness routinely uploads new workouts and many of them are 30 minutes or longer. I just tried this choreography routine the other day; I used to dance professionally when I was younger so it was fun to see if I could still pull off the moves. By the end of a dance lesson, your heart will be pumping.

3. Throw It Back With Jazzercise

Remember the Jazzercise movement of the ‘70s and ‘80s? Or are you a millennial who wants to know how your parents worked out? These Jazzercise videos on YouTube are a serious throwback.

Jazzercise was founded by Judi Sheppard Missett in 1969. The form of exercise promises to this day to help you burn up to 800 calories in an hour by combining dance, strength, and resistance training in one workout. See if you can keep up with these leotard-clad ladies.

4. Low-Impact Cardio

If you’re dealing with painful joints or are just working out for the first time, a great place to start is a low-impact cardio workout. Cardio is good for getting your heart beating faster, which helps protect it by making it stronger. You can search the term “beginner” + any type of workout you’re interested in doing on YouTube to find something that works for you.

5. Walk at Home

Did you know you can walk a mile…in your living room? Leslie Sansone made walking at home famous with her easy to follow videos. This is a great video to send to a friend or older family member who you’re worried about not getting enough exercise.

Hopefully these fun ideas inspired you to get moving. Staying active and eating well are key components of keeping your immune system working at its best, so get moving sooner rather than later.

I’m in need of some serious inspiration for free indoor exercises to do, and I know I’m not alone. RELATED:  Subscribe to the Dr. Oz newsletter for wellness tips, recipes, and exclusive sneak peeks from The Dr. Oz Show. If I’m going to do something other than walk, I like to workout at home anyway — even in my 650 square foot apartment. There’s something about getting to sweat freely with no one watching and being just inches away from my own shower that truly motivates me to get moving. Here are a few free things you can do now that will help keep your body moving and hopefully get you out of your headspace for a while. The key is to mix it up and try something new. 1.  Yoga  Anyone who’s ever tried working out through YouTube can tell you that there are endless free yoga videos online. Yoga is particularly useful during a work-from-home or quarantine period because it can reduce stress, lower blood pressure , and can even change the grey matter in your brain, according to Sharecare, which may help reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease . The breathing techniques you learn in yoga are very meditative, and usually are matched to movements. This means your brain has little to no time to focus on anything else besides what you’re doing. Think about fitting in yoga where you’d normally fit in your commute to and from work. Dr. Oz does a 7-minute yoga routine every morning that you can start today, no matter what your skill level is. 2. Learn Choreography  A lot of people may find dancing to be totally humiliating in public, but when you’re in the comfort of your own living room, anything goes. Popsugar Fitness routinely uploads new workouts and many of them are 30 minutes or longer. I just tried this choreography routine the other day; I used to dance professionally when I was younger so it was fun to see if I could still pull off the moves. By the end of a dance lesson, your heart will be pumping. 3. Throw It Back With Jazzercise  Remember the Jazzercise movement of the ‘70s and ‘80s? Or are you a millennial who wants to know how your parents worked out? These Jazzercise videos on YouTube are a serious throwback. Jazzercise was founded by Judi Sheppard Missett in 1969. The form of exercise promises to this day to help you burn up to 800 calories in an hour by combining dance, strength, and resistance training in one workout. See if you can keep up with these leotard-clad ladies. 4. Low-Impact Cardio  If you’re dealing with painful joints or are just working out for the first time, a great place to start is a low-impact cardio workout. Cardio is good for getting your heart beating faster, which helps protect it by making it stronger . You can search the term “beginner” + any type of workout you’re interested in doing on YouTube to find something that works for you. 5. Walk at Home  Did you know you can walk a mile…in your living room? Leslie Sansone made walking at home famous with her easy to follow videos. This is a great video to send to a friend or older family member who you’re worried about not getting enough exercise. Hopefully these fun ideas inspired you to get moving. Staying active and eating well are key components of keeping your immune system working at its best, so get moving sooner rather than later.

https://lifeshack.io/your-lack-of-gym-time-during-lockdown-is-not-as-detrimental-as-you-think/,"This week’s free workout

Let’s face it, COVID-19 has flipped our daily schedules and fitness regimens completely upside down. Maybe you were hitting the gym regularly, pumping iron, feeling good, and crushing your goals. And then COVID-19 reared its ugly head and now you’re in your house all day, endlessly looking for food in the fridge, and wondering how you interacted with your friends before Zoom.

You know you should exercise at home, but maybe you don’t know how to effectively organize your bodyweight exercises to produce an actual workout. Or, you want to exercise, but you feel doing some bodyweight exercises in your living room has little impact on your health the way that lifting weights in the gym does. With people not being able to readily access their beloved gyms and fitness environments during this time of quarantine, it’s understandable to feel frustrated and a little lost.

Thankfully, we don’t have to wait out this pandemic before feeling strong, fit, and back to our normal selves.

Turns out there is research to suggest we’re not as screwed as we think during this quarantine. These articles are relevant and timely since a lot of individuals are nervous about their body’s response to not being able to hit the gym since COVID-19.

In one study in 2017, participants who completed a 4 week resistance training program did NOT experience any reductions in lean muscle mass, muscular strength, or muscular endurance after a 2 week de-training period (AKA they were completely physically inactive). The only thing these individuals did during those 2 weeks was consume consistent protein supplementation (Hwang et al, 2017)

In another study, scientists looked at the effects of detraining (physical inactivity) in young adults following 16 weeks of consistent resistance training. After 16 weeks of consistent resistance training, they separated the individuals into three groups.

One group exercised once per week at 1/3 of their normal training volume, another group exercised once per week at 1/9 of their normal training volume, and the last group avoided physical activity all together (this was named the detraining group).

The group that performed 1/3 normal training volume once per week was still able to gain muscle mass (hypertrophy), the group that performed 1/9 of their training volume maintained their muscle mass, while the detraining group lost muscle mass (muscle atrophy). However, in the detraining group that performed no physical activity, both muscle size and muscular strength did not decrease as expected. While muscle size decreased in this group, their actual physical strength was retained during physical inactivity. (Bickel et al, 2011).

So, what does this mean?

I like to think of this as the shampoo effect of exercise (a little bit can go a long way). If you’ve been training regularly prior to being self-quarantined and were consistently exercising for quite some time, even if you were to cease ALL physical activity over this quarantine you wouldn’t be losing as much muscular strength as you initially thought. Maybe complete physical inactivity may cause some muscle atrophy (reduction in muscle mass) but that’s assuming you don’t do anything for weeks on end during this phase of self-isolation. And we know the benefits of exercise for our immune system, productivity, mood, and brain health. So completely kicking your feet up and cutting out exercise all together isn’t an option during this time anyway!

This means our bodyweight exercises aren’t so useless after all, and we’re not declining in our fitness as much as we think we are during this stressful time. Even if you exercise a few times per week and do so efficiently during this quarantine, you can maintain some of your muscle mass and strength that you so gloriously obtained at the gym prior to COVID-19. While we can’t go to a gym and use different external loads (AKA weights) to build muscle or burn as much fat as we want, we can still MAINTAIN most of our muscular strength and size. The goal is to stay active and to embrace physical maintenance as much as we can. Even if I’m being a realist, I’d rather engage in a consistent body weight movement practice over the next few months and return to the gym two steps behind, than avoid physical activity all together and feel five steps behind. We must control what we can control, and we must keep moving.

Your Workout Solution

You might be asking, “How do I stay active and organize my workouts? How do I workout without any equipment at home?” I got you covered.

Every week, I’ll be posting a 7-day regimen to help guide you through your workouts Monday through Sunday. That means all the hard work is done for you. Exercises, reps and sets are all laid out for you with videos to ensure you’re doing the exercises correctly. Your only job is to follow along the workout and reserve a few yards of space. And, the best part, it’s free!

How the Workouts are Structured:

The weekly regimen that’s laid out for you consists of 3 days of bodyweight resistance training, 2 days of cardio, one day of active rest and mobility work, and one day of full rest to let your body recover.

Resistance days are composed of 6 main movement variations – Squat, Lunge, Hinge, Push, Pull, and Core. Cardio days give you the option of either going for a run (if you can/want/feel safe) or performing the full body circuit. The mobility day is more-so a day to momentarily pump the brakes and keep your joints healthy at the same time.

Quick Definitions/Comments That Are Important For Your Success:

AMRAP – stands for “As Many Rounds As Possible.” You’ll experience this type of training for your cardio days. This type of training allows you to maintain a sustained heart rate as you perform different exercises. You can also self-pace or rest as needed for these workouts.

CARS – stand for “Controlled Articular Rotations.” This is a method of training in both the rehab and performance world that preserves joint function, increases joint lubrication, and strengthens tissues surrounding the joint. These movements are essentially “joint circles” in a slow, intentional, and controlled manner (Functional Anatomy Seminars, 2018). They seem pretty easy and simple, but they’re not. You’ll find this type of exercise on your active rest day.

If there is an exercise in this program that is too challenging for you: modifying that exercise to fit your needs is completely acceptable. For example – Wednesday’s workout includes a “single arm overhead hold while performing a forward lunge”. If doing this exercise is challenging for you, or just not feasible, it’s perfectly okay to modify the exercise to just a normal forward lunge for the reps and sets indicated. Modifications or even regressions of exercises are welcome, especially since this is YOUR movement practice!

As always, if you have any questions or concerns about the exercises themselves, please reach out. I’d rather you contact me and ask how to perform a particular exercise than you assume you’re doing an exercise correctly. Just like with any fitness regimen, your safety is priority #1!

Lastly, if you are in pain or are unsure if you are able to exercise due to other health concerns, please see a local medical professional (Primary Care Physician, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Chiropractor, etc) in your area for an appropriate medical screening and evaluation prior to exercise.

Enjoy the week and stay safe!

To support us, please consider a contribution.

Donald Trump is demanding a packed Republican national convention with “no face coverings and no social distancing”, North Carolina’s governor’s office has said.

The US president spoke with Democrat governor Roy Cooper by phone, the office revealed, where they discussed the scheduled August convention in Charlotte.

Mr Trump insisted on the lack of Covid-19 measures because he does not want to see signs of the pandemic in his renomination audience, a spokesperson for Mr Cooper said.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

The president this week threatened to move his formal renomination elsewhere if he does not get guarantees by next week of being able to hold a large-scale event.

The convention, set to begin on 24 August, is supposed to have events in Charlotte’s downtown sports arena, capped by Mr Trump’s nomination speech three days later.

During the call, when Mr Trump “insisted on a full convention arena with no face coverings and no social distancing the governor expressed concerns and suggested a scaled-back event with fewer attendees”, spokesperson Sadie Weiner wrote in an email.

“They agreed to continue talking about ways to have a safe convention in Charlotte.”

The conversation came hours after Mr Cooper’s health secretary, Mandy Cohen, called for more specifics beyond the safety protocols the GOP convention’s leaders sent her in a letter on Thursday.

Mr Cooper’s administration has wanted more planning about public health and safety given the uncertainty Covid-19 has caused regarding commerce and movement restrictions.

Ms Cohen wrote to Republican National Committee chairperson Ronna McDaniel and convention chief Marcia Lee Kelly asking them to confirm whether Mr Trump wanted the convention’s final night to have “people together in a crowd-like setting” and without social distancing or face masks for participants.

Ms Cohen also wanted numbers on how many people would be inside the Spectrum Centre nightly, and how social distancing would occur there.

Ms Kelly and Ms McDaniel wrote that they needed further direction and assurances from him by next Wednesday to move forward on a convention they said would bring a massive economic boost to the city.

The Republican National Committee declined to comment on Friday night. Earlier Friday, Ms McDaniel told a Charlotte radio station it appeared Mr Cooper was dragging his feet on a decision and attributed it to a “little bit of gamesmanship” and politics. Mr Cooper is seeking re-election this autumn in a state the Republicans won in 2016.

“We are very happy for them to give us guidelines, but ultimately it’s going to come down to the elected officials to tell us how we can conduct our convention, and then we can plan,” Ms McDaniel told WBT. “We’re still hoping to make it work, but we’re not going to wait indefinitely.”

Mr Cooper suggested to reporters on Thursday that the state had no timeline. Florida and Georgia’s governors have said they’re interested in hosting the convention.

Right now, Mr Cooper’s Covid-19 executive order prevents mass indoor assemblies of more than 10 people, but that could change in the weeks leading up to the convention if case and hospitalisation numbers keep improving.

While Republicans offered on Thursday several proposed steps to screen and protect convention attendees’ health, it lacked a final safety plan – something Ms Cohen and Mr Cooper said they want, such as one that Nascar offered before racing last weekend at Charlotte Motor Speedway, albeit with no fans.

Mr Cooper has gradually eased business restrictions in the state, with restaurants now allowed to offer limited indoor dining. But entertainment venues, bars and gyms remain closed.

Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, has by far the most Covid-19 cases in the state, with more than 3,800 cases as of Friday morning and roughly 90 deaths.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing,"On 23 June, the Prime Minister announced changes to lockdown measures that would apply from 4 July. Guidance on what this means can be found here.

Everyone’s actions have helped to reduce the transmission of coronavirus in our communities. Fatalities and infection rates continue to fall.

The government has set out its plan to return life to as near normal as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly and fairly as possible in order to safeguard livelihoods, but in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS. The most important thing we can continue to do is to stay alert, control the virus, and, in doing so, save lives.

This guidance applies in England – people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should follow the specific rules in those parts of the UK.

At this stage of our recovery strategy:

You can spend time outdoors, including private gardens and other outdoor spaces, in groups of up to six people from different households, following social distancing guidelines

You should go to work if you cannot work from home and your business has not been required to close by law

Children in early years (age 0-5), reception, year 1 and year 6 can return to childcare or school in line with the arrangements made by their school

You can be tested as part of the test and trace programme, which will enable us to return to normal life as soon as possible, by helping to control transmission risks

From 13 June, you will now also be able to:

Form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household if you live alone or are a single parent with dependent children - in other words, you are in a household where there is only one adult

Attend a place of worship for individual prayer

From 15 June:

You will be able to visit more shops and additional outdoor attractions - drive-in cinemas and animal attractions like zoos, farms and safari parks

Year 10 and 12 pupils in secondary schools and further education colleges will begin to receive some face to face support.

You will have to wear a face covering on public transport

If, after lifting restrictions, the government sees a concerning rise in the infection rate, then it may have to re-impose some restrictions in as targeted a way as possible.

That is why you should stay alert and follow social distancing guidelines. You must not:

gather outdoors in groups of more than six people with people you do not live with (except for limited circumstances) or, from 13 June, people that are not in your support bubble (if applicable)

visit friends or family inside their home or any other indoor place, except for the limited set of circumstances set out in law or from 13 June if they are in your support bubble

stay away from your home or your support bubble household overnight - including holidays - except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work purposes

This guidance explains the measures that will help you to stay alert and safe as we continue to respond to the challenges of coronavirus. Key parts of these measures are underpinned by law, which sets out clearly what you must and must not do – every person in the country must continue to comply with this. The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce the law – including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

Find answers to the most frequently asked questions about what you should and should not do during the coronavirus outbreak on our FAQs page.

1. Protecting different groups of people

This guidance is for the general public who are fit and well. There is separate, specific guidance on isolation for households with a possible coronavirus infection.

Some people, including those aged 70 and over, those with specific chronic pre-existing conditions and pregnant women, are clinically vulnerable, meaning they are at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. As we begin to ease restrictions, this group who are clinically vulnerable – see section 9 – should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their household.

There is a further group of people who are defined, also on medical grounds, as clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus – that is, people with specific serious health conditions. They are advised to continue shielding to keep themselves safe by staying at home and avoiding gatherings or, if individuals wish to spend time outdoors, to take extra care to minimise contact with others by keeping two metres apart at all times.

2. Meeting family and friends

You should continue to stay alert and limit your contact with others. Staying at home is the easiest way to do this. However, we know that it has been difficult for people to be cut off from their family and friends in recent months.

In England, from 13 June, there will be two ways that you can see people outside of your household. In doing so, it’s important to continue to take the necessary precautions to minimise the risk of spreading infection:

You are already able to meet outdoors in a group of up to six people (including people you don’t live with), whilst observing social distancing guidelines and keeping at least 2 metres apart

From 13 June, single adult households - in other words adults who live alone or with dependent children only - can form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household. All those in a support bubble will be able to spend time together inside each other’s homes, including overnight, without needing to stay 2 metres apart. Individuals may only form a support bubble with one other household. We are making this targeted change to support those who might be feeling lonely or isolated, while ensuring we continue to keep the rate of transmission down

You must not:

Meet other people indoors - including in their home or your home - unless you are in a support bubble (from 13 June), or for other limited circumstances set out in law

If you are part of a support bubble, visit anyone else in another household outside of your support bubble

Meet outdoors in a group of more than six, with people who are not in your household or (where applicable) support bubble

Form a support bubble (from 13 June) with another household if neither you nor they are in a single adult household

Stay overnight in another household that is not in your support bubble (from 13 June and where applicable), unless it is for the limited set of circumstances already outlined in law

The more people you have interactions with, the more chances we give the virus to spread. Therefore, try to limit the number of people you see - especially over short periods of time. Those who are eligible to form a support bubble, should only do so exclusively with one other household.

Further guidance on how to see your friends and family safely can be found here.

When you leave your home, you should follow the guidelines on staying safe outside your home. Most importantly, this includes the key advice that you should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of your household or support bubble (where applicable). Face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if you are in an enclosed space where social distancing is difficult and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. From 15 June face coverings must be worn on public transport, as set out in law.

If you or someone in your household or, from 13 June, your support bubble (if applicable) are showing coronavirus symptoms, everyone in your support bubble should stay home. If you or a member of your support bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme, the individual contacted must stay at home. If the individual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the support bubble must then isolate. This is critical to staying safe and saving lives.

By following this guidance, you are helping to protect yourself, your family, the NHS and your community.

Further guidance on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been issued.

3. Returning to school

The Government has announced the intention to implement a phased return for early years settings and schools, and has provided guidance on the return of children to schools and childcare. Schools are now open for early years (aged 0-5), Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 groups, subject to local arrangements. From 15 June, secondary schools and further education colleges will also begin some face to face support with Year 10 and 12 pupils.

You can find out more about the Government’s approach to education and how schools are preparing.

School places of all age groups remain available to the children of critical workers.

4. Going to the shops

The Government has announced that non-essential retail stores will be able to reopen from 15 June. They are expected to follow COVID-19 Secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers.

This means that all shops on the high street can now open.

You must only visit shops with people you live with or, if applicable, people in your support bubble and you should practise social distancing from other people at all times.

5. Other businesses and venues

For the time being, certain other businesses and venues will still be required by law to stay closed to the public, subject to the limited exceptions. From 15 June, these include:

Restaurants, cafes and pubs, other than for takeaway

Cinemas (other than drive-in cinemas), theatres and nightclubs

Hair, beauty and nail salons

libraries (apart from click and collect services), community centres, and youth centres

indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, gyms, arcades and soft play facilities

outdoor attractions such as funfairs and theme parks

some communal places within parks, such as playgrounds and outdoor gyms

places of worship (except for funerals and for the purposes of individual prayer)

hotels, hostels, bed and breakfasts, campsites, caravan parks, and boarding houses for commercial/leisure use, excluding use by those who live in them permanently, those who are unable to return home, critical workers where their need is for a work purpose, elite athletes and those needing to self-isolate after arriving in the UK

See a list of businesses that remain closed (from 15 June). Other businesses can remain open and their employees can travel to work, where they cannot work from home.

6. Visiting public places

You can spend time outdoors, including exercise, as often as you wish. This must be with people you live with or, if applicable, from 13 June, your support bubble, or in a gathering of up to six, which can include people from outside your household. You should keep two metres apart from people not in your household or support bubble at all times.

You should continue to avoid public transport other than for essential journeys so should make journeys by cycling, walking or driving in a private vehicle where possible.

You may travel to outdoor publicly accessible open spaces irrespective of distance with people in your household, and from 13 June, your support bubble, but should follow social distancing guidance while you are there. You should plan ahead to ensure that, where you are visiting places like National Parks, beaches or zoos, you have checked that they are open and appropriately prepared for visitors. Many other outdoor venues where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces will remain closed as set out in the law. Campsites will remain closed and you are not allowed to stay away overnight, so should allow enough time to return home.

When travelling to outdoor spaces, it is important that people respect the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and do not travel to different parts of the UK where their intended activities there would be prohibited by legislation passed by the relevant devolved administration.

7. Going to work

With the exception of the organisations listed in this guidance on closing businesses and venues, the government has not required any other businesses to close to the public – it is important for business to carry on.

All workers who cannot work from home should travel to work if their workplace is open. Sectors of the economy that are allowed to be open should be open – such as food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientific research. As soon as practicable, workplaces should be set up to meet the new COVID-19 Secure guidelines. These will keep you as safe as possible, while allowing as many people as possible to resume their livelihoods. In particular, workplaces should, where possible, ensure employees can maintain a two metre distance from others, and wash their hands regularly.

At all times, workers should follow the guidance on self-isolation if they or anyone in their household or or, from 13 June, support bubble, shows coronavirus symptoms. You should not go into work if you are showing symptoms, or if you or any of your household or, from 13 June, support bubble, are self-isolating. This is consistent with advice from the Chief Medical Officer.

There is specific guidance in relation to work carried out in people’s homes – for example by tradespeople carrying out repairs and maintenance, cleaners, or those providing paid-for childcare in a child’s home.

8. Enforcing the law

The police and local authorities have the powers to enforce the requirements set out in law if people do not comply with them. The police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures, but if you breach the regulations, they may instruct you to disperse, leave an area, issue you with a fixed penalty notice or arrest you where they believe it necessary. They may also instruct you to take steps to stop your children breaking these legal requirements again if they have already done so.

The government has introduced higher penalties for those who do not comply, to reflect the increased risk to others of breaking the rules as we begin to ease the restrictions. If the police believe that you have broken the law – or if you refuse to follow their instructions enforcing the law – a police officer may issue you with a fixed penalty notice for £100 (reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days). If you have already received a fixed penalty notice, the amount will increase to £200 and double on each further repeat offence, up to a maximum of £3200.

9. Clinically vulnerable people

If you have any of the following health conditions, you may be clinically vulnerable, meaning you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. You are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if you do go out, take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household or support bubble.

Clinically vulnerable people are those who are:

aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)

under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (that is, anyone instructed to get a flu jab each year on medical grounds):

chronic (long-term) mild to moderate respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis

chronic heart disease, such as heart failure

chronic kidney disease

chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis

chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), or cerebral palsy

diabetes

a weakened immune system as the result of certain conditions or medicines they are taking (such as steroid tablets)

being seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above)

pregnant women

As above, there is a further category of people with serious underlying health conditions who are clinically extremely vulnerable, meaning they are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus. You, your family and carers should be aware of the guidance on shielding which provides information on how to protect yourself still further should you wish. Updated advice is available here.

10. Communicating with the public

The government will continue to keep the public informed of the impacts of coronavirus on the UK, and the law and guidance that is in place to protect the public.

The measures set out will be kept under constant review, and formally revisited at the end of June. They will be relaxed if the scientific evidence shows that this is possible. If people begin to act recklessly, which could impact on the transmission of coronavirus in our communities, further restrictions will have to be implemented again.","       Skip to main content         Tell us whether you accept cookies  We use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.

Guidance on what this means can be found here .  Everyone’s actions have helped to reduce the transmission of coronavirus in our communities. Fatalities and infection rates continue to fall.  The government has set out its plan to return life to as near normal as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly and fairly as possible in order to safeguard livelihoods, but in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS. The most important thing we can continue to do is to stay alert, control the virus, and, in doing so, save lives.  This guidance applies in England – people in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland should follow the specific rules in those parts of the UK.  At this stage of our recovery strategy:   You can spend time outdoors, including private gardens and other outdoor spaces, in groups of up to six people from different households, following social distancing guidelines  You should go to work if you cannot work from home and your business has not been required to close by law  Children in early years (age 0-5), reception, year 1 and year 6 can return to childcare or school in line with the arrangements made by their school  You can be tested as part of the test and trace programme , which will enable us to return to normal life as soon as possible, by helping to control transmission risks   From 13 June, you will now also be able to:   Form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household if you live alone or are a single parent with dependent children - in other words, you are in a household where there is only one adult  Attend a place of worship for individual prayer   From 15 June:   You will be able to visit more shops and additional outdoor attractions - drive-in cinemas and animal attractions like zoos, farms and safari parks  Year 10 and 12 pupils in secondary schools and further education colleges will begin to receive some face to face support.

This guidance is for everyone, including children. It advises on social distancing measures we should all be taking to reduce social interaction between people in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). It is intended for use in situations where people are living in their own homes, with or without additional support from friends, family and carers. If you live in a residential care setting guidance is available.

We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.

This group includes those who are:

Note: there are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If you are in this category, next week the NHS in England will directly contact you with advice about the more stringent measures you should take in order to keep yourself and others safe. For now, you should rigorously follow the social distancing advice in full, outlined below.

People falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:

people who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication

people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy

people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment

people with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets)

people with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)

What is social distancing?

Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).

They are to:

Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough Avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible Work from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information Avoid large and small gatherings in public spaces, noting that pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and similar venues are currently shut as infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together. Avoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media Use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services

Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is practicable.

We strongly advise you to follow the above measures as much as you can and to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible, particularly if you:

are over 70

have an underlying health condition

are pregnant

This advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.

Handwashing and respiratory hygiene

There are general principles you can follow to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:

washing your hands more often - with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser when you get home or into work, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, eat or handle food

avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands

avoid close contact with people who have symptoms

cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin and wash your hands

clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home

What should you do if you develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)

The same guidance applies to the general population and those at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19). If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature and/or new and continuous cough), self-isolate at home for 7 days. You can find the full guidance at stay at home.

Ask family, friends and neighbours to support you and use online services. If this is not possible, then the public sector, business, charities, and the general public are gearing up to help those advised to stay at home. It is important to speak to others and ask them to help you to make arrangements for the delivery of food, medicines and essential services and supplies, and look after your physical and mental health and wellbeing.

If you receive support from health and social care organisations, for example, if you have care provided for you through the local authority or health care system, this will continue as normal. Your health or social care provider will be asked to take additional precautions to make sure that you are protected. The advice for formal carers is included in the Home care provision.

What should you do if you have hospital and GP appointments during this period?

We advise everyone to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, if you have a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, talk to your GP or clinician to ensure you continue to receive the care you need and consider whether appointments can be postponed.

What is the advice for visitors including those who are providing care for you?

You should contact your regular social visitors such as friends and family to let them know that you are reducing social contacts and that they should not visit you during this time unless they are providing essential care for you. Essential care includes things like help with washing, dressing or preparing meals.

If you receive regular health or social care from an organisation, either through your local authority or paid for by yourself, inform your care providers that you are reducing social contacts and agree on a plan for continuing your care.

If you receive essential care from friends or family members, speak to your carers about extra precautions they can take to keep you safe. You may find this guidance on Home care provision useful.

It is also a good idea to speak to your carers about what happens if one of them becomes unwell. If you need help with care but you’re not sure who to contact, or if you do not have family or friends who can help you, you can contact your local council who should be able to help you.

What is the advice if I live with a vulnerable person?

If you live in a house with a vulnerable person refer to our household guidance.

Looking after your mental wellbeing

Understandably, you may find that social distancing can be boring or frustrating. You may find your mood and feelings are affected and you may feel low, worried or have problems sleeping and you might miss being outside with other people.

At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse. There are simple things you can do that may help, to stay mentally and physically active during this time such as:

look for ideas of exercises you can do at home on the NHS website

spend time doing things you enjoy – this might include reading, cooking, other indoor hobbies or listening to the radio or watching TV programmes

try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water and try to avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs

keep your windows open to let in fresh air, get some natural sunlight if you can, or get outside into the garden

You can also go for a walk or exercise outdoors if you stay more than 2 metres from others.

It is important to look after your mental health and wellbeing. Further guidance is also available on supporting children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing.

What steps can you take to stay connected with family and friends during this time?

Draw on support you might have through your friends, family and other networks during this time. Try to stay in touch with those around you over the phone, by post, or online. Let people know how you would like to stay in touch and build that into your routine. This is also important in looking after your mental wellbeing and you may find it helpful to talk to them about how you are feeling.

Remember it is OK to share your concerns with others you trust and in doing so you may end up providing support to them too. Or you can use a NHS recommended helpline.

Advice for informal carers

If you are caring for someone who is vulnerable, there are some simple steps that you can take to protect them and to reduce their risk at the current time.

Ensure you follow advice on good hygiene such as:

wash your hands on arrival and often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser

cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze

put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards

do not visit if you are unwell and make alternative arrangements for their care

provide information on who they should call if they feel unwell, how to use NHS 111 online coronavirus service and leave the number for NHS 111 prominently displayed

find out about different sources of support that could be used and access further advice on creating a contingency plan is available from Carers UK

look after your own wellbeing and physical health during this time. Further information is available in our mental health and wellbeing guidance

It advises on social distancing measures we should all be taking to reduce social interaction between people in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). It is intended for use in situations where people are living in their own homes, with or without additional support from friends, family and carers. If you live in a residential care setting guidance is available .  We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.  This group includes those who are:   aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)  under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (ie anyone instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds):  chronic (long-term) mild to moderate respiratory diseases, such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , emphysema or bronchitis   chronic heart disease, such as heart failure   chronic kidney disease  chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis   chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease , motor neurone disease , multiple sclerosis (MS) , a learning disability or cerebral palsy  diabetes  a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS , or medicines such as steroid tablets   being seriously overweight (a body mass index ( BMI ) of 40 or above)    those who are pregnant   Note: there are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If you are in this category, next week the NHS in England will directly contact you with advice about the more stringent measures you should take in order to keep yourself and others safe. For now, you should rigorously follow the social distancing advice in full, outlined below.  People falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:   people who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication  people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy  people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment  people with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets)  people with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)   What is social distancing?  Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).  They are to:   Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19).

https://www.fox13news.com/news/tampa-megachurch-crowded-with-worshipers-despite-social-distancing-orders,"Cheers and applause could be heard on a Tampa megachurch's livestream Sunday from a few hundred people inside The River at Tampa Bay Church. The church is refusing to close its doors despite a ""safer at home"" order in effect in Hillsborough County meant to slow the spread of coronavirus.

""It should make us all uncomfortable,"" said John DeBevoise, a pastor at Palma Ceia Presbyterian Church, located in South Tampa.

DeBevoise was among one of the first churches in the Bay Area to move online.

""People should follow the safer-at-home order as a way of not only caring for themselves, but caring for their neighbors,"" DeBevoise said.

The crowd was an unlikely sight to see and frustrating to many.

""It just seems pretty irresponsible to set up something like that and put all those people at risk,"" said Jeff Anderson, owner of Classic Touch Cleaners.

Anderson said his company had to adjust to new social-distancing guidelines as a business owner.

The River at Tampa Bay Church held regular services Sunday. A spokesperson for the church told FOX 13 over the phone that social distancing guidelines are in place.

A livestream of the service was available online, but the church still allowed hundreds of members to attend in person.

""They are trying to beat me up, you know, over having the church operational. But we are not non-essential,"" Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne is heard saying during The River at Tampa Bay Church services.

FOX 13 reached out to the church Sunday, but they declined our request for an interview.

""We feel that it would be wrong for us to close our doors on them, at this time, or any time. In a time of crisis, people are fearful and in need of comfort and community,"" the church said in statement posted to their website.

Pastor Howard-Browne defended his decision to keep the church open in a video posted to his YouTube channel.

""We brought in 13 machines that basically kill every virus in the place,"" Howard-Browne said. ""If they sneeze it shoots it down like at 100 miles per hour and it will neutralize it in a split second.""

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office says in a statement that they have ""spoken to the leaders at the church regarding their Sunday services that were in direct violation of the President's guidelines for America, recommendations made by the CDC, and orders from the Governor and the Hillsborough County Policy Group.""

A sign by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office was seen placed across the street from The River Church in Tampa recommending social distancing practices.

The sheriff's office has advised the church of the dangers they are putting their congregation in by not maintaining proper social distancing.

As of Sunday night, both attorneys for the church and the sheriff's office are in contact to determine how compliance can be acheived to keep the public safe.

https://massivesci.com/articles/vampire-bats-socializing-food-sharing-grooming/,"A common way illnesses move is through physical interaction – touching hands or hugging, having close conversations, and being coughed or sneezed on are all common ways that pathogens are spread. But the intricacies of how sickness spreads are of increasing importance as diseases like COVID-19 spread around the world, prompting questions about what we really know about transmission.

“Epidemiological models have tried to predict how pathogens spread, assuming all interactions are the same,"" said Sebastian Stockmaier, a PhD student at the University of Texas. But this isn’t always the case.

New research, led by Stockmaier and published in the Journal of Animal Ecology from a group of researchers in the US and Panama explores how social behaviors in vampire bats were affected when the bats were sick.

Vampire bats are highly social creatures, living in colonies of hundreds to thousands of individuals. Socialization is a key component of their survival strategy, as they care for one another through mutually beneficial behaviors such as reciprocal grooming and food sharing, the process of licking each other’s mouths to share food – the food being regurgitated blood. Relatives are most likely to food-share, and this behavior is more common between female bats than males.

This behavior, while essential to survival, also plays a role in social structure. Studies have shown some bats will stay home while the rest go out hunting, waiting for them to return and food-share regurgitated blood. But, these lazy bats who take advantage of the food sharing process may eventually be treated like freeloaders and be denied food-sharing from bats who spend more time hunting.

To measure how sickness impacts social behavior, both ""sickness"" and ""social behavior"" must be defined. Stockmaier and the other researchers defined ""sickness"" as an immune response to an infection, causing a bat to spend more energy fighting the infection than other activities. They wanted to examine how social behavior, including food-sharing and grooming, were affected when bats were sick.

The researchers monitored the social behavior of a small captive bat colony at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. Bats were injected with a bacteria that stimulated their immune systems and made them sick, so that they lacked energy for basic activities. Food (raw cattle blood) was dispensed through the trial, and the bats were free to interact with one another. To encourage food sharing, the researchers also periodically withheld food from some of the bats, keeping them isolated from the rest of the group for 26-28 hours. This simulated ""missed foraging opportunities,"" or nights where the bats left their colony to feed but were unsuccessful. The researchers wanted to see if the bats with food would share with the fasting bats when they were returned to the colony.

sick bats groomed bats that were not closely related to them less often than they did when they were healthy

Despite being sick, bats continued to socialize, but sickness changed how they did so. Sick bats groomed themselves less and received less grooming from healthy bats. The researchers attribute this to the symptoms of their illness itself, since the less active bats groomed other bats less, causing healthy bats to not return the favor.

Food-sharing is considered an essential habit for survival, and both sick and healthy bats continued to practice it. Bats that were injected with the bacteria (the ""sick"" bats) had been fasting before the injection, so they especially needed food. The sick bats then begged for food by licking another bat's mouth. Bats continued to beg and feed each other, despite being sick. The only notable behavioral change that Stockmaier and the other researchers observed was that sick bats groomed bats that were not closely related to them less often than they did when the ""groomees"" were healthy.

Even in the midst of an epidemic, the vampire bats retained their familial structures – mothers continued to feed their offspring, regardless of who was sick. This shows that while sickness may make bats lethargic and less inclined to socialize, it doesn’t prevent them from doing so with close family members.

Not all diseases are made equal. Many bats in North America are afflicted with white nose syndrome, a fungal disease with a high fatality rate that especially affects hibernating bats. A study on little brown bats found that white nose syndrome also interferes with bat socialization behaviors; sick bats were groomed less and were less likely to visit a water source, likely because the trip took a lot of energy.

Stockmaier compares the group's findings in their vampire bat experiment to a child who is sick at home: their parent will care for their child no matter what. Says Stockmaier, “If you think of it like social distancing – it’s not like you’re totally self-isolated. You’re probably with your family and still interacting in some way.""","����W��ˇ�O�����p�ͪY�5ډ����_��<�aF�J:j

https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/04/public-health-protests-301534,"“The injustice that’s evident to everyone right now needs to be addressed,” Abraar Karan, a Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician who’s exhorted coronavirus experts to amplify the protests' anti-racist message, told me. ""While I have voiced concerns that protests risk creating more outbreaks, the status quo wasn’t going to stop #covid19 either,"" he wrote on Twitter this week.

It’s a message echoed by media outlets and some of the most prominent public health experts in America, like former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden, who loudly warned against efforts to rush reopening but is now supportive of mass protests. Their claim: If we don’t address racial inequality, it’ll be that much harder to fight Covid-19. There’s also evidence that the virus doesn’t spread easily outdoors, especially if people wear masks.

The experts maintain that their messages are consistent—that they were always flexible on Americans going outside, that they want protesters to take precautions and that they're prioritizing public health by demanding an urgent fix to systemic racism.

But their messages are also confounding to many who spent the spring strictly isolated on the advice of health officials, only to hear that the need might not be so absolute after all. It’s particularly nettlesome to conservative skeptics of the all-or-nothing approach to lockdown, who point out that many of those same public health experts—a group that tends to skew liberal—widely criticized activists who held largely outdoor protests against lockdowns in April and May, accusing demonstrators of posing a public health danger. Conservatives, who felt their own concerns about long-term economic damage or even mental health costs of lockdown were brushed aside just days or weeks ago, are increasingly asking whether these public health experts are letting their politics sway their health care recommendations.

“Their rules appear ideologically driven as people can only gather for purposes deemed important by the elite central planners,” Brian Blase, who worked on health policy for the Trump administration, told me, an echo of complaints raised by prominent conservative commentators like J.D. Vance and Tim Carney.

Conservatives also have seized on a Twitter thread by Drew Holden, a commentary writer and former GOP Hill staffer, comparing how politicians and pundits criticized earlier protests but have been silent on the new ones or even championed them.

“I think what’s lost on people is that there have been real sacrifices made during lockdown,” Holden told me. “People who couldn’t bury loved ones. Small businesses destroyed. How can a health expert look those people in the eye and say it was worth it now?”

Some members of the medical community acknowledged they’re grappling with the U-turn in public health advice, too. “It makes it clear that all along there were trade-offs between details of lockdowns and social distancing and other factors that the experts previously discounted and have now decided to reconsider and rebalance,” said Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School. Flier pointed out that the protesters were also engaging in behaviors, like loud singing in close proximity, which CDC has repeatedly suggested could be linked to spreading the virus.

“At least for me, the sudden change in views of the danger of mass gatherings has been disorienting, and I suspect it has been for many Americans,” he told me.

The shift in experts’ tone is setting up a confrontation amid the backdrop of a still-raging pandemic. Tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases continue to be diagnosed every day—and public health experts acknowledge that more will likely come from the mass gatherings, sparked by the protests over George Floyd’s death while in custody of the Minneapolis police last week.

“It is a challenge,” Howard Koh, who served as assistant secretary for health during the Obama administration, told me. Koh said he supports the protests but acknowledges that Covid-19 can be rapidly, silently spread. “We know that a low-risk area today can become a high-risk area tomorrow,” he said.

Yet many say the protests are worth the risk of a possible Covid-19 surge, including hundreds of public health workers who signed an open letter this week that sought to distinguish the new anti-racist protests “from the response to white protesters resisting stay-home orders.”

Those protests against stay-at-home orders “not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives,” according to the letter’s nearly 1,300 signatories. “Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.”

“Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” the letter signers add. “However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.”

Was it fair to decry conservatives’ protests about the economy while supporting these new protests? And if tens of thousands of people get sick from Covid-19 as a result of these mass gatherings against racism, is that an acceptable trade-off? Those are questions that a half-dozen coronavirus experts who said they support the protests declined to directly answer.

“I don’t know if it’s really for me to comment,” said Karan. He did add: “Addressing racism, it can’t wait. It should’ve happened before Covid. It’s happening now. Perhaps this is our time to change things.”

“Many public health experts have already severely undermined the power and influence of their prior message,” countered Flier. “We were exposed to continuous daily Covid death counts, and infections/deaths were presented as preeminent concerns compared to all other considerations—until nine days ago,” he added.

“Overnight, behaviors seen as dangerous and immoral seemingly became permissible due to a ‘greater need,’” Flier said.

The frustration from some conservatives is an outgrowth of how Covid-19 has affected the United States so far. In Blue America, the pandemic is a dire threat that’s killed tens of thousands in densely packed urban centers like New York City—and warnings from infectious-disease experts like Tony Fauci carry the weight of real-world implications. In many parts of Red America, rural states like Alaska and Wyoming still have fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases, and some residents are asking why they shuttered their economies for a virus that had little visible effect over the past three months.

Pollsters also have consistently found a partisan split on how Americans view the pandemic, with Democrats believing that the media is underplaying the risks of Covid-19 while Republicans say that the threat has been exaggerated. That attitude may change with virus numbers on the march in states like Alabama and Arkansas.

People on both sides are already trying to figure out whom to blame if coronavirus cases jump as widely expected after hundreds of thousands of Americans spilled into the streets this past week, sometimes in close proximity for hours at a time. When we discussed the possible risks of a large public gathering, protest supporters like Karan and Koh seized on police behaviors —like using pepper spray and locking up protesters in jail cells—which they noted created significant risks of their own to spread Covid-19.

“Trump will try to blame protestors for [the] spike in coronavirus cases he caused,” a spokesperson for Protect Our Care, a progressive-aligned health care group, wrote in a memo circulated to media members on Wednesday. While acknowledging the risks of mass protests, “the reality is that the spikes in cases have been happening well before the protests started—in large part because Trump allowed federal social distancing guidelines to expire, failed to adequately increase testing, and pushed governors to reopen against the advice of medical experts,” the spokesperson claimed.","       Skip to Main Content              POLITICO               Magazine   The Agenda   Pro    Search     Search                 SECTIONS    The Agenda   Magazine   Congress   White House   Video   Podcasts      2020 Elections    News   Election Results   Delegate Tracker   Forecast   Endorsements   Issues   Polls   Money      NEWSLETTERS    Playbook   Playbook PM   POLITICO Nightly: Coronavirus Special Edition   Huddle   All Newsletters     SERIES    The Deciders   What Works   Women Rule      POLITICO LIVE    Live Home   Upcoming Events   Previous Events   About POLITICO Live     COLUMNS & CARTOONS    Rich Lowry   Jack Shafer   Matt Wuerker   Cartoon Carousel      POLICY    Agriculture   Cannabis   Cybersecurity   Defense   Education   eHealth   Employment & Immigration   Energy & Environment   Finance & Tax   Health Care   Space   Sustainability   Technology   Trade   Transportation      EDITIONS    California   Canada   China   Europe   Florida   New Jersey   New York   Pro      Follow us    Twitter   Instagram   Facebook       My Account   Log In Log Out                        Magazine          Coronavirus   Suddenly, Public Health Officials Say Social Justice Matters More Than Social Distance  For months, health experts told Americans to stay home. Now, many are encouraging the public to join mass protests.

He also co-authors the POLITICO Pulse newsletter and hosts the Pulse Check podcast.    For months, public health experts have urged Americans to take every precaution to stop the spread of Covid-19—stay at home, steer clear of friends and extended family, and absolutely avoid large gatherings.  Now some of those experts are broadcasting a new message: It’s time to get out of the house and join the mass protests against racism.   Advertisement       “We should always evaluate the risks and benefits of efforts to control the virus,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, tweeted on Tuesday. “In this moment the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.”                      “The injustice that’s evident to everyone right now needs to be addressed,” Abraar Karan, a Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician who’s exhorted coronavirus experts to amplify the protests' anti-racist message, told me. ""While I have voiced concerns that protests risk creating more outbreaks, the status quo wasn’t going to stop #covid19 either,"" he wrote on Twitter this week.  It’s a message echoed by media  outlets and some of the most prominent public health experts in America, like former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden, who loudly warned against efforts to rush reopening but is now supportive of mass protests. Their claim: If we don’t address racial inequality, it’ll be that much harder to fight Covid-19. There’s also evidence that the virus doesn’t spread easily outdoors, especially if people wear masks.  The experts maintain that their messages are consistent—that they were always flexible on Americans going outside, that they want protesters to take precautions and that they're prioritizing public health by demanding an urgent fix to systemic racism.  But their messages are also confounding to many who spent the spring strictly isolated on the advice of health officials, only to hear that the need might not be so absolute after all. It’s particularly nettlesome to conservative skeptics of the all-or-nothing approach to lockdown, who  point out that many of those same public health experts —a group that tends to skew liberal— widely criticized activists who held largely outdoor protests against lockdowns in April and May, accusing demonstrators of posing a public health danger. Conservatives, who felt their own concerns about long-term economic damage or even mental health costs of lockdown were brushed aside just days or weeks ago, are increasingly asking whether these public health experts are letting their politics sway their health care recommendations.  “Their rules appear ideologically driven as people can only gather for purposes deemed important by the elite central planners,” Brian Blase, who worked on health policy for the Trump administration, told me, an echo of complaints raised by prominent conservative commentators like J.D. Vance and Tim Carney .   Conservatives also have seized on a Twitter thread by Drew Holden, a commentary writer and former GOP Hill staffer, comparing how politicians and pundits criticized earlier protests but have been silent on the new ones or even championed them.  “I think what’s lost on people is that there have been real sacrifices made during lockdown,” Holden told me. “People who couldn’t bury loved ones. Small businesses destroyed. How can a health expert look those people in the eye and say it was worth it now?”  Some members of the medical community acknowledged they’re grappling with the U-turn in public health advice, too. “It makes it clear that all along there were trade-offs between details of lockdowns and social distancing and other factors that the experts previously discounted and have now decided to reconsider and rebalance,” said Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School. Flier pointed out that the protesters were also engaging in behaviors, like loud singing in close proximity, which CDC has repeatedly suggested could be linked to spreading the virus.  “At least for me, the sudden change in views of the danger of mass gatherings has been disorienting, and I suspect it has been for many Americans,” he told me.  The shift in experts’ tone is setting up a confrontation amid the backdrop of a still-raging pandemic. Tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases continue to be diagnosed every day—and public health experts acknowledge that more will likely come from the mass gatherings, sparked by the protests over George Floyd’s death while in custody of the Minneapolis police last week.  “It is a challenge,” Howard Koh, who served as assistant secretary for health during the Obama administration, told me. Koh said he supports the protests but acknowledges that Covid-19 can be rapidly, silently spread. “We know that a low-risk area today can become a high-risk area tomorrow,” he said.  Yet many say the protests are worth the risk of a possible Covid-19 surge, including hundreds of public health workers who signed an open letter this week that sought to distinguish the new anti-racist protests “from the response to white protesters resisting stay-home orders.”  Those protests against stay-at-home orders “not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives,” according to the letter’s nearly 1,300 signatories. “Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.”  “Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” the letter signers add. “However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.”  Was it fair to decry conservatives’ protests about the economy while supporting these new protests? And if tens of thousands of people get sick from Covid-19 as a result of these mass gatherings against racism, is that an acceptable trade-off? Those are questions that a half-dozen coronavirus experts who said they support the protests declined to directly answer.  “I don’t know if it’s really for me to comment,” said Karan.  He did add: “Addressing racism, it can’t wait. It should’ve happened before Covid. It’s happening now. Perhaps this is our time to change things.”  “Many public health experts have already severely undermined the power and influence of their prior message,” countered Flier. “We were exposed to continuous daily Covid death counts, and infections/deaths were presented as preeminent concerns compared to all other considerations—until nine days ago,” he added.  “Overnight, behaviors seen as dangerous and immoral seemingly became permissible due to a ‘greater need,’” Flier said.  The frustration from some conservatives is an outgrowth of how Covid-19 has affected the United States so far. In Blue America, the pandemic is a dire threat that’s killed tens of thousands in densely packed urban centers like New York City—and warnings from infectious-disease experts like Tony Fauci carry the weight of real-world implications. In many parts of  Red America, rural states like Alaska and Wyoming still have fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases, and some residents are asking why they shuttered their economies for a virus that had little visible effect over the past three months.  Pollsters also have consistently found a partisan split on how Americans view the pandemic, with Democrats believing that the media is underplaying the risks of Covid-19 while Republicans say that the threat has been exaggerated. That attitude may change with virus numbers on the march in states like Alabama and Arkansas.  People on both sides are already trying to figure out whom to blame if coronavirus cases jump as widely expected after hundreds of thousands of Americans spilled into the streets this past week, sometimes in close proximity for hours at a time. When we discussed the possible risks of a large public gathering, protest supporters like Karan and Koh seized on police behaviors —like using pepper spray and locking up protesters in jail cells—which they noted created significant risks of their own to spread Covid-19.  “Trump will try to blame protestors for [the]  spike in coronavirus cases he caused,” a spokesperson for Protect Our Care, a progressive-aligned health care group, wrote in a memo circulated to media members on Wednesday.

A conservative lawmaker is demanding the coronavirus task force disband.  California’s anti-vaccine movement has a new target: masks.   How America botched its reopening and walked straight into an ""I told you so"" moment.    Read all coronavirus coverage »                Contra those claims, public health experts like Koh generally acknowledge that it’s going to be difficult to tease apart why Covid-19 cases could jump in the coming weeks, given the sheer number of Americans joining mass gatherings, states relaxing restrictions and other factors that could pose challenges for disease-tracing on a large scale.  Some experts also are cautious of condemning states for rolling back restrictions after inconclusive evidence from states that already moved to do so. For instance, a widely shared Atlantic article in April framed the decision by Georgia’s GOP governor to relax social-distancing restrictions as an “experiment in human sacrifice.” A month later, Georgia’s daily coronavirus cases have stayed relatively level and it’s not clear whether the rollback led to significant new outbreaks.  What is clear is that the only successful tactic to stop Covid-19 remains social distancing and, failing that, thoroughly wearing personal protective equipment. Yet there’s also considerable video and photo evidence of maskless protesters, sometimes closely huddled together with public officials—also sans mask—in efforts to defuse tensions, or recoiling from police attacks that forced them to remove protection.  That means a collision between the protests and coronavirus is coming, which will force decisions big and small. Will local leaders need to reimpose restrictions when cases go up? Will that advice be trusted? Or is it possible that their guidance was too draconian all along?  Some participants in the new protests—whether marching themselves or drawn in from the sidelines—say they recognize the threat they’re facing.  A Washington, D.C., man named Rahul Dubey attracted national attention for sheltering protesters from the police inside his home on Monday night. On Wednesday, he told me that he was on the way to get a coronavirus test and was planning to self-quarantine himself for two weeks—having spent hours in close proximity to dozens of maskless people.  It’s a reminder of a line often heard from medical experts: Public health should be above politics. Now some conservatives are invoking it too.  “The virus doesn’t care about the nature of a protest, no matter how deserving the cause is,” Holden said.

(Alex Brandon/AP) Opinion by Karen Tumulty Karen Tumulty Columnist covering national politics Email Bio Follow Columnist March 24, 2020 at 3:45 PM EDT In the interest of protecting the nation’s health, it is time to socially distance ourselves from the crazy things that President Trump keeps saying. I’ve been an enthusiastic advocate of bringing back the daily White House briefings , which Trump’s team had basically quit holding some time around the middle of 2018. So I am relieved to see they have resumed and hope they will continue once the coronavirus crisis has passed. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. But not the way they are being conducted now, which is as a substitute for the rallies Trump can no longer hold. More coverage of the coronavirus pandemic As a former White House reporter myself, I respect, in principle, that everything a president says is news. When he speaks, journalists must take note. Those on the social media sidelines who urge that news organizations boycott the briefing room are simply wrong. AD AD The real question is how to report what a president says when it is disconnected from reality. During these daily briefings, Trump has lied that the virus is “something that we have tremendous control over.” He has promoted an unproven drug treatment for combating the infection. He rewrites the history of the epidemic to make his own performance look better (“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic”). He erupts at individual journalists (“You’re a terrible reporter”). He plays the victim (“It costs me billions and billions of dollars to be president”). In other words, the briefing has become a sort of live-action version of Trump’s Twitter feed. He is spreading misinformation that could actually put people’s lives in danger. AD So the first thing that should happen is this: The networks, with the exception of C-SPAN, should quit carrying the briefings live. On Monday night, nearly all of them went halfway there and cut away when the session began running off the rails. Only Fox News carried the whole thing. AD Let’s all hit the pause button and make sure that what we give our readers and viewers is the whole story. This is something two former White House press secretaries — Mike McCurry, who held the job under Democrat Bill Clinton, and Ari Fleischer, who did it under Republican George W. Bush — recommended all the way back in 2017. They wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review : “If the briefing is ‘embargoed’ until its conclusion, it will become just one of several raw ingredients that journalists can use to prepare their reports on the work of the president and the White House. It would instantly become a toned-down briefing, and reporters would use the information from the briefing and test it against other sources as they prepare coverage.” AD It’s likely that, deprived of the rush he gets from a live television audience, the president will lose interest in showing up in the briefing room. There would be less temptation for reporters to grandstand as well. But on the off chance that Trump continues to appear behind the lectern, there is something else the journalists in the briefing room could do. AD Ignore him. Joe Lockhart, who succeeded McCurry as Clinton’s spokesman, noted that the critical value of these daily sessions is hearing from people who actually know what they are talking about. “In times of crisis, you should always let the experts lead,” he said. “The main idea is to reassure people and the President isn’t doing that because he’s not an expert.” Briefings might begin with the press secretary or chief of staff giving a brief summary of what Trump is up to — who he met with, what issues he is dealing with — and then turn things over to the most authoritative voices in the room. AD Absent a rational process like this, reporters in the room should coordinate on their own to control the flow of questions and hold off asking any political ones until the end. Sign up to receive the latest installment of the Opinions Essay by Karen Tumulty in your inbox If the experts are allowed to lay out the facts first, we might also be spared having to watch the pained expressions on their faces as Trump tells whoppers. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has gotten high marks for offering candid assessments at these briefings, but as he noted, it’s not his job to muzzle the president : “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.” AD Finally, journalists should give up thinking that there is anything to be accomplished by confronting Trump on his dissembling or that he will ever admit to making a mistake. “Accountability IS a legitimate aim, but only a politician with a sense of shame can be held accountable by tough questions,” press critic Jay Rosen tweeted a few days ago: “People who think that confronting Donald Trump more forcefully with facts he cannot deny will produce some kind of accountability must never have lived with a malignant narcissist.” AD You can’t stop Trump from acting like Trump. But never has it been more crucial for the media to limit the damage he leaves in his wake.

https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/04/16/mits-ai-predicts-catastrophe-if-social-distancing-restrictions-relax-too-soon/,"MIT recently trained a machine learning model to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19. According to the AI, we should be seeing a plateau where the amount of new cases begins to level off in the US and Italy in the next week. This good news, however, comes with a dire warning: relaxing quarantine measures too soon will be catastrophic.

The engineers behind the AI explain the results as being very similar to the situation that happened in Singapore where quarantine and social distancing efforts managed to almost completely flatten the curve before an ill-advised return to business as usual caused a massive resurgence in COVID-19 cases.

The MIT team trained the AI to extrapolate publicly-available data for insights into the disease’s spread, taking into account how different governments handled social distancing and quarantine orders as well as other standard epidemiology parameters.

In order to ensure the model was capable of producing accurate results, the team trained it on data ranging from January through early March and then matched it’s predictions for April with actual statistics.

It turns out the machine was able to accurately predict the curve in all the countries it had data for. Per the team’s research paper:

Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially.

The data further indicates that the US, currently the epicenter of the pandemic, should experience “a halting of infections” around April 20th. However, the report clearly demonstrates that we should not interpret this is as the right time to relax current quarantine and social distancing measures:

We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.

In other words: social distancing and quarantine measures are working! Perhaps even better than many experts would have thought. But, if we abandon them too soon they will have been for naught. We’ll have to start back over at square one.

H/t: Tech Crunch",
https://medium.com/@ariadnelabs/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day-ac21d7fa78b4,"Our health system will not be able to cope with the projected numbers of people who will need acute care should we not muster the fortitude and will to socially distance each other starting now. On a regular day, we have about 45,000 staffed ICU beds nationally, which can be ramped up in a crisis to about 95,000. Even moderate projections suggest that if current infectious trends hold, our capacity (locally and nationally) may be overwhelmed as early as mid-late April. Thus, the only strategies that can get us off this concerning trajectory are those that enable us to work together as a community to maintain public health by staying apart.

The wisdom, and necessity, of this more aggressive, early, and extreme form of social distancing can be found here. I would urge you to take a minute to walk through the interactive graphs — they will drive home the point about what we need to do now to avoid a worse crisis later. Historical lessons and experiences of countries worldwide have shown us that taking these actions early can have a dramatic impact on the magnitude of the outbreak. So what does this enhanced form of social distancing mean on a daily basis, when schools are cancelled?

Here are some steps you can start taking now to keep your family safe and do your part to avoid a worsening crisis:

1. We need to push our local, state, and national leaders to close ALL schools and public spaces and cancel all events and public gatherings now.

A local, town by town response won’t have the adequate needed effect. We need a statewide, nationwide approach in these trying times. Contact your representative and your governor to urge them to enact statewide closures. As of today, six states have already done so. Your state should be one of them. Also urge leaders to increase funds for emergency preparedness and make widening coronavirus testing capacity an immediate and top priority. We also need legislators to enact better paid sick leave and unemployment benefits to help nudge people to make the right call to stay at home right now.

2. No kid playdates, parties, sleepovers, or families/friends visiting each other’s houses and apartments.

This sounds extreme because it is. We are trying to create distance between family units and between individuals. It may be particularly uncomfortable for families with small children, kids with differential abilities or challenges, and for kids who simply love to play with their friends. But even if you choose only one friend to have over, you are creating new links and possibilities for the type of transmission that all of our school/work/public event closures are trying to prevent. The symptoms of coronavirus take four to five days to manifest themselves. Someone who comes over looking well can transmit the virus. Sharing food is particularly risky — I definitely do not recommend that people do so outside of their family.

We have already taken extreme social measures to address this serious disease — let’s not actively co-opt our efforts by having high levels of social interaction at people’s houses instead of at schools or workplaces. Again — the wisdom of early and aggressive social distancing is that it can flatten the curve above, give our health system a chance to not be overwhelmed, and eventually may reduce the length and need for longer periods of extreme social distancing later (see what has transpired in Italy and Wuhan). We need to all do our part during these times, even if it means some discomfort for a while.

3. Take care of yourself and your family, but maintain social distance.

Exercise, take walks/runs outside, and stay connected through phone, video, and other social media. But when you go outside, do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members. If you have kids, try not to use public facilities like playground structures, as coronavirus can live on plastic and metal for two to three days, and these structures aren’t getting regularly cleaned.

Going outside will be important during these strange times, and the weather is improving. Go outside every day if you are able, but stay physically away from people outside your family or roommates. If you have kids, try playing a family soccer game instead of having your kids play with other kids, since sports often mean direct physical contact with others. And though we may wish to visit elders in our community in person, I would not visit nursing homes or other areas where large numbers of the elderly reside, as they are at highest risk for complications and mortality from coronavirus.

Social distancing can take a toll (after all, most of us are social creatures). The CDC offers tips and resources to reduce this burden, and other resources offer strategies to cope with the added stress during this time.

We need to find alternate ways to reduce social isolation within our communities through virtual means instead of in-person visits.

4. Reduce the frequency of going to stores, restaurants, and coffee shops for the time being.

Of course trips to the grocery store will be necessary, but try to limit them and go at times when they are less busy. Consider asking grocery stores to queue people at the door in order to limit the number of people inside a store at any one time. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly before and after your trip. And leave the medical masks and gloves for the medical professionals — we need them to care for those who are sick. Maintain distance from others while shopping — and remember that hoarding supplies negatively impacts others so buy what you need and leave some for everyone else. Take-out meals and food are riskier than making food at home given the links between the people who prepare food, transport the food, and you. It is hard to know how much that risk is, but it is certainly higher than making it at home. But you can and should continue to support your local small businesses (especially restaurants and other retailers) during this difficult time by buying gift certificates online that you can use later.

5. If you are sick, isolate yourself, stay home, and contact a medical professional.

If you are sick, you should try to isolate yourself from the rest of your family within your residence as best as you can. If you have questions about whether you qualify or should get a coronavirus test, you can call your primary care team and/or consider calling the Massachusetts Department of Public Health at 617.983.6800 (or your state’s department of health if you are outside of Massachusetts). Don’t just walk into an ambulatory clinic — call first so that they can give you the best advice — which might be to go to a drive-through testing center or a virtual visit on video or phone. Of course, if it is an emergency call 911.",
https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/,"Watson: If you don’t have symptoms, going out in nature where you are not within six feet of other people is okay. We need to look after our mental and physical health, and fresh air, nature, and exercise are really important for that. However, meeting people is risky and could undermine our collective sacrifice to reduce viral transmission, especially if you don’t keep your distance. If you do go out with a friend, stay at least six feet away and avoid physical contact.

Read: Here’s who should be avoiding crowds right now

Should I be worried about going to the grocery store?



Cannuscio: I would say try to shop at times when there are very few other shoppers there. That [could mean] going first thing in the morning when the store opens, or late at night. I think many people will rely on delivery, and that’s just the nature of our lives right now. For delivery workers, I would say, leave the food on the doorstep and ring the bell, rather than interacting face-to-face with the person who’s ordered the food.

Should I take public transportation?



Cannuscio: First of all, people who have the opportunity or the option of working at home should absolutely use that option right now. For people who have essential functions and have to be at work, if they have any flexibility in their schedules they should try to ride at non-peak hours. On subways or buses, people should try to stand as far away from other people as possible. I think it’s important for planners to think about, for example, putting more buses on the most heavily traveled routes, to maybe thin out the crowds on those buses. In cities where it’s possible to walk, that would be a better option.

For people who can afford to use ride-sharing services, you’re limiting the number of people you’re in contact with as the rider, so to me that seems like a reasonable step to take. Of course, I worry about all those drivers who have people in and out of their cars all day long.

And of course, everyone should be using good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. If you have to cough, cough into your elbow. And I can’t believe I have to say this, but I’ve been in public places where people have been spitting, in parks or on the sidewalk. I would ask people not to spit!

Watson: It’s hard to say “Don’t take public transit,” because a lot of people rely on it to get to work. If you don’t have to and you can drive, it’s probably a good idea. It will help other people who have to take public transit for their livelihoods to do so and do so more safely.

Should my family be canceling events like birthday parties AND weddings?



As of March 15, the CDC recommends that all gatherings involving 50 people or more be canceled for at least the next eight weeks.

Cannuscio: One of the best ways we can show love to the people we care about is to step back and to stay away. In many cases that takes courage, and it takes speaking out over these social norms that dictate that we should be polite and we should be together and we should celebrate and gather.

Should I stop visiting elderly relatives?



Watson: I think we should start limiting visitation to people who are in assisted-living facilities and nursing homes. I know that’s really tough, and maybe setting things up so you can visit them virtually is a good idea. [That way], they can see you and say hello, [without putting] them at extra risk.","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe      Family   The Dos and Don’ts of ‘Social Distancing’   Experts weigh in on whether you should cancel your dates, dinner parties, and gym sessions.  Kaitlyn Tiffany   March 12, 2020     Valeria Ferraro / Echoes Wire / Barcroft Media via Getty     Link Copied     Editor’s Note: Information about the novel coronavirus is rapidly changing. As a result, some of the information or advice in this article may be out-of-date. You can find The Atlantic ’s most current COVID-19 coverage here .  Updated at 11:20 a.m. ET on March 19, 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for “community mitigation strategies” to limit the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which include recommendations for “social distancing”—a term that epidemiologists are using to refer to a conscious effort to reduce close contact between people and hopefully stymie community transmission of the virus. But what exactly does “social distancing” look like for a woman trying to go about her life while staying healthy and helping keep the people around her healthy? Even detailed instructions are difficult to sift for actionable advice. If I have a fourth date tonight, do I go? If I’m invited to a wedding in two weeks in another state, is it too late to cancel? If we’re on lockdown, and I live alone, can I walk to my friend’s apartment when I feel sad? If I end up officially quarantined, can I walk around the park at night for some fresh air? The CDC guidelines acknowledge factors like the size of a community, its population density, its access to health care, and caveats that social-distancing measures can “be scaled up or down depending on the evolving local situation.” There are conflicting messages coming from media and people’s peers: On Reddit, young people are signing a “self-quarantine manifesto” while, at a press conference , the mayor of New York City is telling people to continue visiting bars and restaurants as normal, to protect the local economy.        Read: Cancel everything So I took my personal questions to a series of public-health experts. “I think it’s a hard time because many of the recommendations we’re making are about increasing the distance between people, but of course, being close to people is what makes life a pleasure,” Carolyn Cannuscio, the director of research at the Center for Public Health Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania said in a phone call. “So this is going to be a very difficult time. No question.” If you’re confused about what to do right now, you’re not alone—even these experts occasionally disagreed on the answers to my questions. Where there were discrepancies, I’ve included all the different answers as fully as possible, and as the situation has evolved, I’ve allowed the experts to update their answers to questions to reflect new information. This guide is aimed toward those who are symptom-free and not part of an at-risk group, with an addendum at the end for those in quarantine. If you are symptom-free but are over 60 years old ; have asthma, heart disease, or diabetes; or are otherwise at risk, experts recommend defaulting to the most conservative response to each of these questions. There is a general consensus that while young and healthy people who are at lower risk for personally suffering severe illness from the coronavirus don’t have to be locking themselves in their homes for the next month, they do need to dramatically alter their daily lives, starting now. If I’m Symptom-Free: Should I be avoiding bars and restaurants?  As of March 16 , in some areas, restaurants and bars have been ordered to close for everything but takeout and delivery.  Cannuscio : People should avoid gathering in public places. People should be at home as much as possible. The measures that have worked to get transmission under control or at least to bend the curve, in China and South Korea, have been extreme measures to increase social distancing. Albert Ko, the chair of the epidemiology department at the Yale School of Public Health : The CDC recommendations are to keep six to 10 feet away from other people. Bottom line, there’s no absolute indication not to go to bars and restaurants, but in practicing good public health—which is kind of a responsibility for everybody in the country—really think about how we can decrease those close contacts. Can I have a small group of friends over to my house for a dinner party or a board-game night? Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: With few exceptions, now is the time to cancel get-togethers. Dating, family visits, house parties, should all be postponed or held virtually if possible. There are personal situations where you must go out for work, for supplies, or to help someone else in need. In those cases, take precautions to keep your distance from others, and wash your hands frequently. If you develop a fever or cough, don’t go out unless it is absolutely necessary or to seek medical care.        Ko : We’re in a gray zone now. The public-health imperative is to create social distance; that’s the only way we’re going to stop this. Think about having those get-togethers but practicing good public health: not sitting very close, trying to keep distance. Wash your hands; avoid touching your face. There are places on the board game that people are constantly touching—routinely disinfect [those, as well as] doorknobs, the bathroom faucets, those types of things. There’s no absolute rule about what works, but what we do know is that decreasing the size of those gatherings, increasing the distance, practicing good hygiene will go a long way. Cannuscio: I would recommend that people minimize social contact, and that means limiting all social engagements. That includes intimate gatherings among friends. I think the exception is if two households are in strict agreement that they are also going to reduce all outside contact and then those two households socialize together, to support one another. I can see social and mental-health advantages to that kind of approach. Should I stop dating? Ko: Dating is usually one person and another person. What we’re really worried about in terms of public health are these large gatherings where you have people crowded together, and you can have what we call super-spreading events. The risk of those goes up exponentially the larger the size of the gathering. Dating is at the other end. I think you can still date. Cannuscio: It is a time to be very cautious about initiating contact with new people. This seems like a great time to get creative with your text messages. [Or] take it to FaceTime or a phone call. Can I go to the gym? Watson:  I would not advise people to go to the gym to work out now. I am trending more toward being conservative with social-distancing measures the more we see from Italy and with the changes in guidance from CDC and state and local health authorities. So, I would not advise people to go to the gym to work out now. Cannuscio: No. In the coming days, as the crisis escalates, our freedom of movement may be restricted, so people will have to get creative about exercising at home. Can someone please host virtual dance parties? Create a playlist to get us through the pandemic? Our family has felt some relief after blasting music and dancing around the kitchen—not to deny the horror of what is happening now, but to deal with it. Our daughter actually thanked us when we threw a dance party. Highly recommend. Can I go For a walk outside with a friend, as long as we stay six feet apart and neither of us feels sick? Cannuscio: For now, walking, running, [and] biking outside, in uncrowded locations, seems like a healthy thing to do. Our family has driven to the woods in the past few days, in search of green and open space. For urban dwellers, finding an empty path is challenging. For people in more remote areas, being outside is a great way to cope. Walking outside with a friend, while keeping distance, is likely to be a relatively low-risk activity. With every additional social contact, the risk of encountering an infected person goes up, so strictly minimize the number of people you interact with. I wouldn’t pick a new friend every day! Stick with one friend, and preferably one who limits their other social contacts, too.        Watson: If you don’t have symptoms, going out in nature where you are not within six feet of other people is okay. We need to look after our mental and physical health, and fresh air, nature, and exercise are really important for that. However, meeting people is risky and could undermine our collective sacrifice to reduce viral transmission, especially if you don’t keep your distance. If you do go out with a friend, stay at least six feet away and avoid physical contact. Read: Here’s who should be avoiding crowds right now Should I be worried about going to the grocery store? Cannuscio: I would say try to shop at times when there are very few other shoppers there. That [could mean] going first thing in the morning when the store opens, or late at night. I think many people will rely on delivery, and that’s just the nature of our lives right now. For delivery workers, I would say, leave the food on the doorstep and ring the bell, rather than interacting face-to-face with the person who’s ordered the food. Should I take public transportation? Cannuscio : First of all, people who have the opportunity or the option of working at home should absolutely use that option right now. For people who have essential functions and have to be at work, if they have any flexibility in their schedules they should try to ride at non-peak hours. On subways or buses, people should try to stand as far away from other people as possible. I think it’s important for planners to think about, for example, putting more buses on the most heavily traveled routes, to maybe thin out the crowds on those buses. In cities where it’s possible to walk, that would be a better option. For people who can afford to use ride-sharing services, you’re limiting the number of people you’re in contact with as the rider, so to me that seems like a reasonable step to take. Of course, I worry about all those drivers who have people in and out of their cars all day long. And of course, everyone should be using good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. If you have to cough, cough into your elbow. And I can’t believe I have to say this, but I’ve been in public places where people have been spitting, in parks or on the sidewalk.

If you don’t have to and you can drive, it’s probably a good idea. It will help other people who have to take public transit for their livelihoods to do so and do so more safely. Should my family be canceling events like birthday parties AND weddings?

In many cases that takes courage, and it takes speaking out over these social norms that dictate that we should be polite and we should be together and we should celebrate and gather. Read: The worst outcome  Should I stop visiting elderly relatives? Watson : I think we should start limiting visitation to people who are in assisted-living facilities and nursing homes. I know that’s really tough, and maybe setting things up so you can visit them virtually is a good idea. [That way], they can see you and say hello, [without putting] them at extra risk.        Cannuscio : I think if we are fortunate enough to live near our elders and we get into the mode of seriously isolating our own families, then one person should be designated to go and visit. If we’re not in a situation where we can truly limit our own social contact, then we will be putting that elder at risk by going to visit. Should I be canceling haircuts and other nonessential appointments? Watson : Those are more one-on-one interactions. I think there’s a lower likelihood that exposure is going to occur that way. I don’t think that’s a big concern. Cannuscio : I would say hold off on your haircut and then when you go back, when it’s clear that we have vanquished this foe, everybody please give your hairdresser extra, extra tips. I hope that policies will be put into place to protect the paychecks of people who will suffer during this period. Should I avoid communal spaces in my apartment building? Cannuscio : Try to schedule your use of those common spaces so you’re going at times when other people aren’t around. If you know there are not a lot of people in the laundry room or mailroom at 6 a.m., go at 6 a.m. People will be inconvenienced, but it’s important to try to spread ourselves out. Should I limit physical interaction with my partner, or other people I live with? Ko : That’s really hard to do. Again, what we’re really worried about is large gatherings. In the home, close contact is almost inevitable. Cannuscio : I would say if you’re in a steady, monogamous relationship and you and that other person are limiting your social contacts, then be as intimate as you want to be. Watson : If you get sick, try to maintain some distance. Otherwise, households should go about their normal business. Can I take my kids to a playground? Watson: This is a tough call. I will only be taking my son when it is not busy and I can keep him six feet away from other kids. If I walk to the park with him and see many other kids playing, I turn around and go home or just continue on with our walk. The outdoors is not an ideal condition for survival of the coronavirus, and it will likely not survive long on playground equipment due to a combination of factors such as precipitation and UV light from the sun. However, to be extra cautious, it may be better to avoid the equipment and play catch, or some other outdoor game instead. Cannuscio : Certainly, there is no chance I would recommend an indoor shared playroom, playground, or play space. For my own children, even the outdoor playground is off-limits, and I would suggest the same to others. One goal is to keep people (including children) away from one another—and children congregate at playgrounds. A second goal is to avoid contaminated surfaces, like play equipment. It’s impractical to suggest that people could use the playground while avoiding people and disinfecting the play surfaces. For now, find the widest open space available to you and your family, and go there.        If I Get Symptoms or Am Exposed to Someone Who’s Sick: If I am waiting out a 14-day quarantine, can I have visitors as long as they stand far away from me? Cannuscio : No, quarantine means “stay away from other people.” You shouldn’t have visitors. Ko : Under quarantine, people really shouldn’t enter the home or be in the same physical space. Read: What will you do if you start coughing? Can I walk around outside at all when I’m under quarantine? Cannuscio : For people who live in areas that are not densely populated, walking around in their yard is probably safe. The idea is that they should not come into contact with any other people. They need to be strict about it. We are not going to defeat this and halt transmission if people loosely interpret what it means to self-quarantine or self-isolate.

https://time.com/5809038/coronavirus-flatten-curve/,"Every day, the number of Americans confirmed as infected by the virus that causes COVID-19 is higher than the day before. Such is the brutality of exponential growth: Not only does the raw number of COVID-19 cases grow, the rate at which it grows increases as well.

The following charts show how six nations, including the U.S., have either managed to stem the tide of the novel coronavirus, or are poised for an explosive growth in cases. TIME will update these charts daily.

Short of a miracle cure, the only way to halt this pandemic in a given region, experts say, is to starve it. And nations around the world are attempting to do just that, by essentially cutting off life support to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That means enforcing social distancing and shelter-in-place policies designed to limit the virus’s access to us — the human bodies that host and enable the microorganism to spread.

If a community enacts these protective measures early enough in the process, it can avoid a local outbreak that rapidly spins out of control and turns into a crisis. The goal is to avoid a sharp, concentrated uptick in cases that exceeds the capacity of the health care system, in favor of a lengthier outbreak that stays within the bounds of what the system can handle—resulting in fewer people getting sick and dying overall. This is what experts call “flattening the curve.”

Experts are currently upholding South Korea as a model for how to flatten the curve; along with China, it is one of only two countries with large outbreaks that have managed to do so. But South Korea stands apart, because it appears to have accomplished this feat without resorting to the draconian measures that China used to stem the tide of the outbreak in its provinces.

In large part, South Korea’s success seems to be due to the fact that, thanks to its experience with MERS back in 2015, the country already had systems in place to react quickly and efficiently to a viral outbreak. After confirming the first COVID-19 cases within its borders, South Korea almost immediately passed a government reform that allowed local manufacturers to make tests based on World Health Organization specifications, scaling up testing resources. The country also enacted travel controls and aggressive case surveillance early on. These measures enabled the country to test hundreds of thousands of people — especially those known to have come into contact with someone who tested positive — within a few weeks of the first identified COVID-19 cases.

The result is a truly stunning decline in new coronavirus cases in South Korea since March 1. Normally, in this critical stage of any sort of contagion, a nation would be lucky just to stabilize the rate of infection down to a flat or very low rate. To achieve a negative rate of infection within weeks is a triumph.

There are other countries that, while not as successful as South Korea appears to be, do seem to be gaining control over their local outbreaks. For example, Singapore was one of the first nations outside of China to be exposed to the virus, and though the number of new cases per day continue to grow there, its government’s quick and aggressive response appears to have kept the overall spread of the infection to a minimum. Singapore’s government has provided funding to cover the costs of both testing and treatment, and, similar to South Korea, has vigorously pursued and then isolated individuals who are believed to have come into contact with people confirmed to be infected by the virus. Without that sort of response, it’s likely that Singapore could resemble the state of affairs in the U.S. or Italy, where COVID-19 spread rapidly and widely.

In the last few days, it does appear that Italy has managed to get a hold on its outbreak, halting the exponential growth of new cases to the point that daily infections are now going down. That is likely to be due to fairly severe measures that have slowed the spread of COVID-19, but also put a hard brake on its economy. The Italian government first forced the closure of public places like gyms, bars, restaurants and most stores. Two weeks ago, they shut down all “non-essential” economic activities. It’s too early yet to say Italy is out of the woods, but it appears to finally be moving in the right direction.

Japan is an interesting, and very different, situation. In the densely populated island nation, daily new cases appear to have leveled off in the past two weeks. Like South Korea and Singapore, Japan has not enacted draconian isolation measures, and like South Korea and Singapore, it seems to have the coronavirus outbreak under control. But Japan has also only performed about 130 tests per million residents, as of the latest official data, published on March 19. Compare that to the nearly 6,000 tests per million residents administered by South Korea or the approximately 6,800 tests per million in Singapore by the same date, and it quickly becomes clear that Japan’s on-paper success in controlling COVID-19 may not accurately represent the truth on the ground.

Methodology: The data for these figures is collected and made public by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, which draws from over a dozen national and international sources. Daily figures and rolling averages were calculated from the difference in cumulative figures from day to day. Each country’s timeline begins when it reached 1% of its total confirmed cases to-date. Scales for each country are set to the maximum daily value in the rolling average so as to best illustrate the change in the curve in each case.

Update, April 30: These charts originally used a rolling average of each day and the previous six days, which is a marginally lagging indicator. They now use a centered average of each day and the three preceding and three following days, meaning the final three days are averages of smaller windows. This method provides a more current look at the data while not significantly changing the outlook in any country.

It’s squashing it. By Anna Fifield Anna Fifield Beijing bureau chief. Email Bio Follow April 7, 2020 at 6:31 AM EDT HAVELOCK NORTH, New Zealand — It has been less than two weeks since New Zealand imposed a coronavirus lockdown so strict that swimming at the beach and hunting in bushland were banned. They’re not essential activities, plus we have been told not to do anything that could divert emergency services’ resources. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. People have been walking and biking strictly in their neighborhoods; lining up six feet apart outside grocery stores while waiting to go one in, one out; and joining swaths of the world in discovering the vagaries of home schooling. It took only 10 days for signs that the approach here — “elimination” rather than the “containment” goal of the United States and other Western countries — is working. AD The number of new cases has fallen for two consecutive days, despite a huge increase in testing, with 54 confirmed or probable cases reported Tuesday. That means the number of people who have recovered, 65, exceeds the number of daily infections. AD “The signs are promising,” Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director general of health, said Tuesday. The speedy results have led to calls to ease the lockdown, even a little, for the four-day Easter holiday , especially as summer lingers on . But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is adamant that New Zealand will complete four weeks of lockdown — two full 14-day incubation cycles — before letting up. She has, however, given the Easter Bunny special dispensation to work this weekend. AD How has New Zealand, a country I still call home after 20 years abroad, controlled its outbreak so quickly? When I arrived here a month ago, traveling from the epicenter of China via the hot spot of South Korea, I was shocked that officials did not take my temperature at the airport. I was told simply to self-isolate for 14 days (I did). AD But with the coronavirus tearing through Italy and spreading in the United States, this heavily tourism-reliant country — it gets about 4 million international visitors a year, almost as many as its total population — did the previously unthinkable: It shut its borders to foreigners March 19. Two days later, Ardern delivered a televised address from her office — the first time since 1982 that an Oval Office-style speech had been given — announcing a coronavirus response alert plan involving four stages, with a full lockdown being Level 4. A group of influential leaders got on the phone with her the following day to urge moving to Level 4. “We were hugely worried about what was happening in Italy and Spain,” said one of them, Stephen Tindall, founder of the Warehouse, New Zealand’s largest retailer. AD AD “If we didn’t shut down quickly enough, the pain was going to go on for a very long time,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s inevitable that we will have to shut down anyway, so we would rather it be sharp and short.” On March 23, a Monday, Ar­dern delivered another statement and gave the country 48 hours to prepare for a Level 4 lockdown. “We currently have 102 cases,” she said. “But so did Italy once.” From that Wednesday night, everyone had to stay at home for four weeks unless they worked in an essential job, such as health care, or were going to the supermarket or exercising near their home. A few hours before midnight, my phone sounded a siren as it delivered a text alert: “Act as if you have COVID-19. This will save lives,” it said , referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “Let’s all do our bit to unite against COVID-19.” Coronavirus? Pandemic? For many in Sweden, life goes on as usual. From the earliest stages, Ar­dern and her team have spoken in simple language: Stay home. Don’t have contact with anyone outside your household “bubble.” Be kind. We’re all in this together. AD AD She’s usually done this from the podium of news conferences where she has discussed everything from the price of cauliflowers to wage subsidies . But she also regularly gives updates and answers questions on Facebook , including one done while sitting at home — possibly on her bed — in a sweatshirt . There have been critics and rebels. The police have been ordering surfers out of the waves. The health minister was caught mountain biking and taking his family to the beach. He was publicly chastised by Ardern, who said she would have fired him if it weren’t disruptive to the crisis response. But there has been a sense of collective purpose. The police phone line for nonemergencies has been overwhelmed with people calling to “dob in,” as we say here, reporting others they think are breaching the rules. AD AD The response has been notably apolitical. The center-right National Party has clearly made a decision not to criticize the government’s response — and in fact to help it. These efforts appear to be paying off. After peaking at 89 on April 2, the daily number of new cases ticked down to 67 on Monday and 54 on Tuesday. The vast majority of cases can be linked to international travel, making contact tracing relatively easy, and many are consolidated into identifiable clusters. Because there is little evidence of community transmission, New Zealand does not have huge numbers of people overwhelming hospitals. Only one person, an elderly woman with existing health problems, has died. Bolsonaro may be the world’s coronavirus skeptic in chief The nascent slowdown reflected “a triumph of science and leadership,” said Michael Baker , a professor of public health at the University of Otago and one of the country’s top epidemiologists. AD AD “Jacinda approached this decisively and unequivocally and faced the threat,” said Baker, who had been advocating for an “elimination” approach since reading a World Health Organization report from China in February. “Other countries have had a gradual ramp-up, but our approach is exactly the opposite,” he said. While other Western countries have tried to slow the disease and “flatten the curve,” New Zealand has tried to stamp it out entirely. Some American doctors have urged the Trump administration to pursue the elimination approach. In New Zealand’s case, being a small island nation makes it easy to shut borders. It also helps that the country often feels like a village where everyone knows everyone else, so messages can travel quickly. AD New Zealand’s next challenge: once the virus is eliminated, how to keep it that way. AD The government won’t be able to allow people free entry into New Zealand until the virus has stopped circulating globally or a vaccine has been developed, Baker said. But with strict border control, restrictions could be gradually relaxed, and life inside New Zealand could return to almost normal. Ardern has said her government is considering mandatory quarantine for New Zealanders returning to the country post-lockdown. “I really want a watertight system at our border,” she said this week, “and I think we can do better on that.” Austria and Denmark are first in Europe to announce easing of coronavirus lockdowns Trump warns parts of nation to brace for coronavirus ‘peak’; surgeon general says this week will ‘be our Pearl Harbor moment’ Mapping the worldwide spread of the coronavirus Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news Coronavirus: What you need to read The Washington Post is providing some coronavirus coverage free, including: Updated July 2, 2020 The latest: Live updates in the U.S. Coronavirus maps: Cases and deaths in the U.S. | Cases and deaths worldwide | Which states are reopening and closing again What you need to know: Summertime activities & coronavirus | Your life at home | Personal finance guide | Make your own fabric mask | Follow all of our coronavirus coverage and sign up for our free newsletter .

In late February and early March, the number of new coronavirus infections in the country exploded from a few dozen, to a few hundred, to several thousand.

[Read: China to ease coronavirus lockdown on Hubei two months after imposing it .] As global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinizing South Korea for lessons. And those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens. Yet other hard-hit nations did not follow South Korea’s lead. Some have begun to show interest in emulating its methods — but only after the epidemic had accelerated to the point that they may not be able to control it any time soon. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden have both called South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, to request details on the country’s measures, according to Mr. Moon’s office. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has hailed South Korea as demonstrating that containing the virus, while difficult, “can be done.” He urged countries to “apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere.” South Korean officials caution that their successes are tentative. A risk of resurgence remains, particularly as epidemics continue raging beyond the country’s borders. Still, Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has repeatedly raised South Korea as a model, writing on Twitter , “South Korea is showing Covid-19 can be beat with smart, aggressive public health.” Image Health workers moved a patient infected with the coronavirus from an ambulance to a hospital in Seoul earlier this month. Credit... Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Lesson 1: Intervene Fast, Before It’s a Crisis Just one week after the country’s first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval. Within two weeks, though South Korea’s confirmed cases remained in the double digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. The country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them.     Latest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak  Updated 2020-07-03T12:25:35.081Z  As U.S. infections reach another record, leaders seek new answers and itineraries.  Pubs are reopening in Britain, and Boris Johnson is urging people not to ‘overdo it.’  Biden supporters are more worried about the health hazards of voting.    See more updates    More live coverage:   Officials also swiftly imposed emergency measures in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million where contagion spread fast through a local church . “South Korea could deal with this without limiting the movement of people because we knew the main source of infection, the church congregation, pretty early on,” said Ki Mo-ran, an epidemiologist advising the government’s coronavirus response. “If we learned about it later than we did, things could have been far worse.” South Koreans, unlike Europeans and Americans, were also primed to treat the coronavirus as a national emergency, after a 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in the country killed 38. The coronavirus is thought to have a five-day incubation period , often followed by a period of mild symptoms that could be mistaken for a cold, when the virus is highly communicable . This pattern creates a lag of a week or two before an outbreak becomes apparent. What looks like a handful of cases can be hundreds; what looks like hundreds can be thousands. “Such characteristics of the virus render the traditional response, which emphasizes lockdown and isolation, ineffective,” said Kim Gang-lip, South Korea’s vice health minister. “Once it arrives, the old way is not effective in stopping the disease from spreading.” Image Workers sprayed disinfectant in a hallway at the government complex in the city of Sejong, in January. Credit... Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock Lesson 2: Test Early, Often and Safely South Korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected. The country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per-capita rate more than 40 times that of the United States. “Testing is central because that leads to early detection, it minimizes further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,” Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea’s foreign minister, told the BBC , calling the tests “the key behind our very low fatality rate as well.” Though South Korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially accused of complacency . Its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway. To spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible — and keep health workers safe by minimizing contact. At 50 drive-through stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. They are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. The process takes about 10 minutes. Test results are usually back within hours. At some walk-in centers, patients enter a chamber resembling a transparent phone booth . Health workers administer throat swabs using thick rubber gloves built into the chamber’s walls. Relentless public messaging urges South Koreans to seek testing if they or someone they know develop symptoms. Visitors from abroad are required to download a smartphone app that guides them through self-checks for symptoms. Offices, hotels and other large buildings often use thermal image cameras to identify people with fevers. Many restaurants check customers’ temperatures before accepting them.

Jung Yeon-Je/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Lesson 3: Contact Tracing, Isolation and Surveillance When someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient’s recent movements to find, test — and, if necessary, isolate — anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing. This allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer. South Korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the MERS outbreak. Health officials would retrace patients’ movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even GPS data from their cars and cellphones. “We did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,” Dr. Ki said. “Later, we had laws revised to prioritize social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.” As the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging. South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks. People who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centers. South Koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off. People ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. Fines for violations can reach $2,500. By identifying and treating infections early, and segregating mild cases to special centers, South Korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. Its case fatality rate is just over one percent, among the lowest in the world. Image By identifying and treating infections early, South Korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. Credit... Woohae Cho for The New York Times Lesson 4: Enlist The Public’s Help There aren’t enough health workers or body-temperature scanners to track everybody, so everyday people must pitch in. Leaders concluded that subduing the outbreak required keeping citizens fully informed and asking for their cooperation, said Mr. Kim, the vice health minister. Television broadcasts, subway station announcements and smartphone alerts provide endless reminders to wear face masks, pointers on social distancing and the day’s transmission data. The messaging instills a near-wartime sense of common purpose. Polls show majority approval for the government’s efforts, with confidence high, panic low and scant hoarding. “This public trust has resulted in a very high level of civic awareness and voluntary cooperation that strengthens our collective effort,” Lee Tae-ho, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters earlier this month. Officials also credit the country’s nationalized health care system, which guarantees most care, and special rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested. Image South Koreans in line to buy face masks in Daegu, where the virus spread quickly through a local church. Credit... Jung Yeon-Je/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Is The Korean Model Transferable? For all the attention to South Korea’s successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive. Some of the technology the country has used is as simple as specialized rubber gloves and cotton swabs. Of the seven countries with worse outbreaks than South Korea’s, five are richer. Experts cite three major hurdles to following South Korea’s lead, none related to cost or technology. One is political will. Many governments have hesitated to impose onerous measures in the absence of a crisis-level outbreak. Another is public will. Social trust is higher in South Korea than in many other countries, particularly Western democracies beset by polarization and populist backlash. But time poses the greatest challenge. It may be “too late,” Dr. Ki said, for countries deep into epidemics to control outbreaks as quickly or efficiently as South Korea has. Image In Seoul on Thursday. Credit... Woohae Cho for The New York Times China turned back the catastrophic first outbreak in Hubei, a province larger than most European countries, though at the cost of shutting down its economy. South Korea’s methods could help the United States, though “we probably lost the chance to have an outcome like South Korea,” Mr. Gottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner, wrote on Twitter . “We must do everything to avert the tragic suffering being borne by Italy.” Max Fisher reported from New York, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

To understand why, it is instructive to simulate the spread of a fake disease through a population. We will call our fake disease simulitis. It spreads even more easily than covid-19: whenever a healthy person comes into contact with a sick person , the healthy person becomes sick, too.         In a population of just five people, it did not take long for everyone to catch simulitis. In real life, of course, people eventually recover. A recovered person can neither transmit simulitis to a healthy person nor become sick again after coming in contact with a sick person.         Let’s see what happens when simulitis spreads in a town of 200 people. We will start everyone in town at a random position, moving at a random angle, and we will make one person sick . Notice how the slope of the red curve, which represents the number of sick people, rises rapidly as the disease spreads and then tapers off as people recover.          Our simulation town is small — about the size of Whittier, Alaska — so simulitis was able to spread quickly across the entire population. In a country like the United States, with its 330 million people, the curve could steepen for a long time before it started to slow. [ Mapping the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and worldwide ] When it comes to the real covid-19, we would prefer to slow the spread of the virus before it infects a large portion of the U.S. population. To slow simulitis, let’s try to create a forced quarantine , such as the one the Chinese government imposed on Hubei province , covid-19’s ground zero.          Whoops! As health experts would expect, it proved impossible to completely seal off the sick population from the healthy. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, explained the impracticalities of forced quarantines to The Washington Post in January . “Many people work in the city and live in neighboring counties, and vice versa,“ Wen said. “Would people be separated from their families? How would every road be blocked? How would supplies reach residents?” As Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, put it: “The truth is those kinds of lockdowns are very rare and never effective.”                Fortunately, there are other ways to slow an outbreak. Above all, health officials have encouraged people to avoid public gatherings, to stay home more often and to keep their distance from others. If people are less mobile and interact with each other less, the virus has fewer opportunities to spread. Some people will still go out. Maybe they cannot stay home because of their work or other obligations, or maybe they simply refuse to heed public health warnings. Those people are not only more likely to get sick themselves, they are more likely to spread simulitis, too. Let’s see what happens when a quarter of our population continues to move around while the other three quarters adopt a strategy of what health experts call “ social distancing .”          More social distancing keeps even more people healthy, and people can be nudged away from public places by removing their allure. “We control the desire to be in public spaces by closing down public spaces. Italy is closing all of its restaurants. China is closing everything, and we are closing things now, too,” said Drew Harris, a population health researcher and assistant professor at The Thomas Jefferson University College of Public Health. “Reducing the opportunities for gathering helps folks social distance.” To simulate more social distancing, instead of allowing a quarter of the population to move, we will see what happens when we let just one of every eight people move.          The four simulations you just watched — a free-for-all, an attempted quarantine, moderate social distancing and extensive social distancing — were random. That means the results of each one were unique to your reading of this article; if you scroll up and rerun the simulations, or if you revisit this page later, your results will change. Even with different results, moderate social distancing will usually outperform the attempted quarantine, and extensive social distancing usually works best of all. Below is a comparison of your results.        Finishing simulations...          Simulitis is not covid-19, and these simulations vastly oversimplify the complexity of real life. Yet just as simulitis spread through the networks of bouncing balls on your screen, covid-19 is spreading through our human networks — through our countries, our towns, our workplaces, our families. And, like a ball bouncing across the screen, a single person’s behavior can cause ripple effects that touch faraway people. [ What you need to know about coronavirus ] In one crucial respect, though, these simulations are nothing like reality: Unlike simulitis, covid-19 can kill. Though the fatality rate is not precisely known, it is clear that the elderly members of our community are most at risk of dying from covid-19. “If you want this to be more realistic,” Harris said after seeing a preview of this story, “some of the dots should disappear.”      Related stories  How to prepare for the coronavirus in the U.S.  How the coronavirus tanked the markets  Millions of tweets peddled conspiracy theories about coronavirus in other countries, an unpublished U.S. report says  How epidemics like covid-19 end (and how to end them faster)          Harry Stevens  Harry Stevens joined The Washington Post as a graphics reporter in 2019.

As voters lined up across Wisconsin on Tuesday, waiting hours in some places, researchers who have been monitoring the spread of the coronavirus nationwide watched in stunned horror and confusion.

It's too soon to say how the decision to allow thousands of Wisconsinites to converge on polling places in the middle of the worst pandemic in 100 years will reshape the state's disease curve. Modelers say to expect better data on that in a couple of weeks, when people infected Tuesday begin to get sick.

But as research teams wait to see the data trickle in — and despite the fact that they all calculate predictions slightly differently — experts who spoke with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel all agreed: This will not help Wisconsin's curve.

Live Updates: The latest on coronavirus in Wisconsin

Daily Digest: What you need to know about coronavirus in Wisconsin

""I don't get it; I honestly do not get it,"" researcher Ali Mokdad said from his home in Seattle, where he's been for a month under Washington's ongoing stay-at-home order.

Mokdad is the chief strategy officer of population health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a prominent research center at the University of Washington, that created one of the most influential national models predicting the coronavirus' spread.

""The message is exactly the same,"" said Mokdad of the various models by national and international research teams. Coronavirus is deadly. It's highly contagious. And the best way to combat it is to stay home for everything other than essential work and trips to buy food, medicine and other survival needs.

On Monday, Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm said in-person voting would ""without question"" increase case totals, ""and an increase in the number of cases in Wisconsin would result in more deaths.""

In many suburban and rural areas, lines were not too long. But in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Dane counties, lines stretched out onto sidewalks and around blocks, ending any chance of social distancing. In the city of Milwaukee, voters stood in line for hours at one of five consolidated ""voting centers"" instead of the 180 smaller neighborhood sites that voters normally use.

""What a disaster,"" said Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins, a co-founder of COVID Act Now, a national model run by volunteer scientists that aims to predict when hospitals will become overwhelmed across the country.

Kreiss-Tomkins said there isn't a specific modeling scenario to show how an election could spread the coronavirus. But he compared the situation to other mass gatherings, including Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and also to states that delayed implementing stay-at-home orders.

""New Orleans is now one of the highest per capita COVID counts in the United States a couple weeks later,"" he said. ""So, cause and effect? There's certainly a case for it.""

Voting likely pushed back peak

Wisconsin's election day came just as some states were seeing a glimmer of hope. The Seattle Times reported the state of Washington may have already seen its peak.

In Wisconsin, data from the state Department of Health Services gives a mixed message. On the last two days of March, March 30 and 31, the number of cases jumped 14.7%. A week later, the number of cases jumped 5.7% from April 6 to April 7. In other words, Wisconsin is still seeing more cases, but the growth rate is slowing.

However — and it's a big however — the number of overall cases that result in hospitalization is rising. And there is concern that testing is not keeping pace with the spread, and that if more people were tested, the numbers would be higher.

In other words, it's hard to say whether Wisconsin is ""flattening the curve"" or not.

Regardless, Mokdad said, the decision to hold the election sets any progress back. It not only sends mixed messages to the public but could push the state closer to overwhelming its health care system.

Mokdad's institute updates projections daily with new data and is used by many state and federal leaders, though some critics say it's on the optimistic side.

The institute's projections on election day, which don't account for the election, showed Wisconsin peaking on April 17, as measured by hospital resources needed. As of Tuesday, it predicted 644 Wisconsities would die of COVID-19 by Aug. 4. The number of daily deaths would peak April 15 at 32.

But there's a tremendous range in that estimate depending on what happens in real life: As few at two and as many at 199 people could die that day, according to the model. The further out the projections go, the wider the range.

Mokdad said the election could push Wisconsin's peak later, with a higher number of deaths and larger shortage of hospital resources.

Precautions may not be enough

State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos — who fought to keep in-person voting Tuesday — touted the precautions taken at the Burlington polling site where he volunteered.

""Actually, there’s less exposure here than you would get if you went to the grocery store or you went to Walmart or you did any of the many things we have to do to live in the state of Wisconsin,"" Vos told the Racine Journal Times.

Mokdad suggested Vos was ill-informed. He noted even doctors and nurses with special training are getting infected across the country.

""These are people who have gear, who know what to do and who have been doing this all their life,"" Mokdad said with frustration. ""How could we afford to let our citizens come out to vote on an election when we can delay it?""

Researchers said the ease with which the coronavirus spreads is a big concern in polling places.

People could arrive with mild to moderate symptoms or still could be in the phase before symptoms start to show. There's evidence that transmission could be as simple as touching a ballot or a pen that someone else had held and then your face. New research shows it could even spread during conversation between two people standing just a bit too close.

'The spark in the process'

Columbia University's Sen Pei helped create a coronavirus prediction model that simulates different levels of daily travel activity. Pei, an associate research scientist, said the election gathering was risky in ways other activities wouldn't approach.

""When you go about your daily life, you only go to some regular places. You go to get groceries. You go to work. You only contact people from certain locations,"" Pei said. ""Here, you're gathering people from different locations and they can bring back the virus to their own location. That is like the spark in the process.""

One infected person can spread the virus to between one and three others, he added.

RELATED: A Wisconsin pastor says lawmakers' request for in-person worship on Easter is arrogant and irresponsible.

In another example of lifting restrictions too soon, Pei modeled what would have happened if national restrictions had been lifted by Easter, an idea President Donald Trump floated in late March but later backed away from.

""It's really quick. The outbreak will resurge or rebound a few days after the lifting of the control measures,"" Pei said of the Easter analysis. ""And it's exponential growth.""

Republican state legislators asked Gov. Tony Evers to allow in-person Easter services this week.

Vos hinted Tuesday that Wisconsin might replicate the voting process with upcoming elections if the outbreak continues. ""We could be dealing with this in August or November, so we need to have a dry run as we’re going through it right now to make sure we get this right,"" he said.

But if Tuesday's situation repeats itself — if voters again have to make a grueling decision between a constitutional right and personal health — Mokdad said the decision for him was clear.

""I have voted in every election and I feel that it's my civic duty,"" Mokdad said. ""If I were a citizen of Wisconsin, I would not go out and vote.""

She did the right thing at the right time, even though it’s not what people wanted to hear.”

To some extent, the divergent paths taken by San Francisco and New York, two cities linked by a lack of affordable housing and yawning wealth gaps, mirror a broader divide between the nation’s East and West Coasts. Washington State, where a cluster of coronavirus cases at a nursing home made the state the early epicenter of the disease in America, has had more success than many other states containing the outbreak in the month since it first erupted there. The governors of Oregon and California have even loaned ventilators to New York and the national stockpile since their supplies haven’t been depleted.

Epidemiologists told me that San Francisco and other West Coast cities likely benefited from the Trump administration’s late-January restrictions on travel from China, while the president’s delay in banning flights from Europe, which he didn’t do until mid-March, hit New York hard. (New research backs this up, indicating that most of New York’s early cases came from Europe in mid-February, The New York Times reported on Wednesday.)

“New York was like Italy, and San Francisco and Washington State are more like, not necessarily the South Koreans, but some of the Asian countries that have had slower growth rates,” Shahpar, a former leader of global rapid response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told me. “Really, it’s about early identification of a problem, saying, ‘We’re going to be more proactive than reactive.’”

It’s that difference in decision making—proactive versus reactive—that has separated leaders at all levels of government during this crisis. “This virus has been ahead of us from day one,” Cuomo lamented on Thursday, as he announced that, once again, New York had seen a daily record—799—in coronavirus deaths.

That may be true for Cuomo and de Blasio, who dragged their feet, not to mention Donald Trump. But it is not true for Breed.

Public-health officials in San Francisco began monitoring the coronavirus outbreak around the holidays in December, Mary Ellen Carroll, who runs the city’s Department of Emergency Management, told me. By late January, Breed had activated San Francisco’s emergency-operations center in preparation for an outbreak—the first such move in any major city in the country. The mayor has since relocated the command post to the Moscone Center, a sprawling complex where top city officials can work in-person while social distancing. Everyone, including Breed, wears a mask when they meet, Carroll said.

Breed told me that what got her attention early on was the ghastly photographs and footage coming out of Wuhan, China, showing the region’s hospitals overrun by coronavirus patients. “A picture’s worth a thousand words—seeing the images of what could potentially happen and then hearing your doctors tell you that we may not have the capacity to handle this situation,” the mayor said, recalling a briefing during which her advisers laid out the possibilities for a similar scenario in stark detail. “We have tons of hospitals in San Francisco. What do you mean we don’t have the capacity to handle an outbreak of this capacity?” Breed recalled thinking. “That’s when I was just like, Oh my goodness, this is serious. And we need to basically sound the alarm in a way that helps us to get ready.”","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe      Politics   The City That Has Flattened the Coronavirus Curve   Mayor London Breed’s early and aggressive moves to contain the outbreak have made San Francisco a national model in fighting the pandemic.  Russell Berman   April 12, 2020     Bloomberg / Getty / The Atlantic     Link Copied    L ondon Breed wasn’t going to wait around for COVID-19. San Francisco had yet to confirm a single case of the coronavirus when Breed, the city’s 45-year-old first-term mayor, declared a state of emergency in late February. Two weeks later, Breed’s decision to ban gatherings of more than 1,000 people forced the hand of the Bay Area’s beloved Golden State Warriors, who this year moved into San Francisco’s Chase Center after nearly a half century in Oakland. Her decision, along with the NBA’s first positive case of the coronavirus, set in motion a chain of events that effectively shut down all of the nation’s major sports leagues. At the time, Breed heard criticism that she was moving too quickly. “Not anymore!” she told me with a chuckle when we spoke by phone this week. Nearly a month after those initial orders to enforce social distancing, San Francisco and the broader Bay Area have emerged as a national model for how early and aggressive action can prevent the explosive rise in cases that has overwhelmed hospitals in New York, where leaders were slower to respond. San Francisco’s case count of 857 as of April 10—with just 13 recorded deaths due to the coronavirus—is much lower than that in metropolises of comparable size such as New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Washington, D.C. The city’s curve is low and flattening, and patients are not flooding into its emergency rooms.        “All evidence suggests that they are doing much better, and the simplest explanation for that is that they did take social-distancing measures very seriously and they did it early,” says Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking the global COVID-19 outbreak. San Francisco and California as a whole have struggled much more than New York to ramp up testing capacity, raising the possibility that the relatively low number of confirmed cases paints an overly rosy picture of the crisis there. But epidemiologists and public-health officials say that while positive cases are surely being undercounted—as they are across the country—San Francisco’s stable public-health system and low death count offer validation of its success so far. “We’re seeing that our hospital beds are not very full at this point,” Yvonne Maldonado, an epidemiologist at Stanford Medical School, told me. “We’re just not seeing a big spike there.” “Deaths are hard to hide,” adds Cyrus Shahpar, a San Francisco–based director at Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit that combats global epidemics. Breed ordered businesses closed and issued a citywide shelter-in-place policy effective on March 17, at a point when San Francisco had fewer than 50 confirmed coronavirus cases. (California Governor Gavin Newsom followed with a similar statewide order a few days later.) On that date, New York City already had more than 2,000 positive cases. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, reluctant either to shutter schools or issue a stay-at-home directive for the nation’s largest city, didn’t take similar action for several days . By the time New York City fully shut down on March 22, more than 10,000 cases were reported across its five boroughs. Read: Cuomo and de Blasio: A tale of two leaders Breed’s aggressiveness was not initially popular. As she ratcheted up the city’s social-distancing mandates, prominent San Franciscans began calling one of the mayor’s political mentors, Senator Kamala Harris. “London Breed’s about to shut down the city,” they complained, Harris told me. She told them to trust Breed. “She took incredible political heat and criticism,” Harris said, “and she had the courage to make a decision that she in her gut, based on science and the research she did, told her this was the right thing to do for her people, even when other people couldn’t see it yet.” The economic hardship a shutdown would cause was not lost on Breed. She was raised in a public-housing project by her grandmother, from whom, Harris said, Breed inherited a practical streak. Breed’s sister died of a drug overdose, while her brother is currently incarcerated on a 44-year sentence for manslaughter. “Her grandmother was a tough lady,” recalled Harris, who has known Breed for years. “She was practical, practical to her core.”        “Hindsight these days is not years later; it’s weeks later,” the senator said. “So hindsight tells us London Breed was really smart. She did the right thing at the right time, even though it’s not what people wanted to hear.” To some extent, the divergent paths taken by San Francisco and New York, two cities linked by a lack of affordable housing and yawning wealth gaps, mirror a broader divide between the nation’s East and West Coasts.

And we need to basically sound the alarm in a way that helps us to get ready.”        She said that as early as January, she recognized that the federal government was not prepared to offer the needed help to boost the city’s supply of protective equipment. On February 25, a top CDC official, Nancy Messonnier, told reporters on a conference call that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States “may be severe” and that people should prepare for disruptions in daily life, including school closures. In D.C., Trump was reportedly incensed that Messonnier was raising such alarm. In San Francisco, Breed declared a state of emergency that very day. A week later, the mayor was urging her constituents on Twitter to “prepare for possible disruption from an outbreak.” That same day, de Blasio was encouraging New Yorkers “to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus.” As mayor of San Francisco, Breed holds a position that two of California’s leading Democrats—Newsom and Senator Dianne Feinstein—have used as a springboard to statewide office. But for Breed, it has not been an easy first two years at city hall. She ascended to the job automatically under city law in December 2017, after Mayor Ed Lee’s unexpected death from a heart attack. At the time, Breed was the only African American woman leading one of the most populous U. S. cities. But six weeks later, the Board of Supervisors ousted her and installed another lawmaker, a white man, in her place. Officially, the board did not want to give her a leg up in the mayoral election over a member who was running for the job. Some of Breed’s supporters, however, say the move smacked of racism. Read: The white men’s club leading America’s largest cities Breed, a Democrat aligned with the party’s establishment wing, won the mayoralty in a close special election a few months later, defeating two more progressive candidates with the help of tabulations from San Francisco’s system of ranked-choice voting . She won election to a full term in 2019, but spent much of the year battling progressives on the city’s pervasive homelessness problem and in local elections where candidates she endorsed were defeated. (Breed backed another losing horse in the presidential race, endorsing former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg midway through his short-lived bid.) “It was a tough year last year,” concedes Andrea Dew Steele, a Breed ally and the founder of Emerge America, a national advocacy group that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for public office. “She didn’t have the coattails that many of us would liked to have seen.” Breed’s performance responding to the coronavirus outbreak could make those earlier stumbles soon forgotten. Steele bemoans the fact that the mayor has yet to get the credit that “darlings” such as Cuomo have, despite more impressive results. In public, Steele told me, Breed has been both calming and commanding. “She’s quite matter-of-fact about why she did what she did. She listened to the experts and she took action,” Steele said. “She wasn’t equivocating about her decision.”        By her own admission, Breed had no particular experience with pandemic response prior to the coronavirus. The disasters San Francisco spends the most time practicing for are earthquakes and fires, although it did have an epidemic-response plan on hand. “This is not one we had practiced. But it is one that we were prepared for,” Breed said. Breed may be relatively new to public-health crises, but the officials she has leaned on—Grant Colfax, a former director of HIV/AIDS policy in the Obama administration; Tomás Aragón, the county’s public-health chief; and Carroll—have decades of experience. Colfax began his career in the 1980s during the height of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, and the epidemiologists I spoke with said the lessons from that period likely contributed to the city’s fast response to the current outbreak. “I think they remember how hard it was when we didn’t close down the bathhouses and saw what happened to the epidemic at that point,” said Maldonado, the Stanford epidemiologist. Officials in San Francisco are cautious about their initial success, cognizant that it could be fleeting if the city lets up too quickly on social distancing. “We are not in any way breathing a sigh of relief at this point or declaring victory in any way,” Carroll said. Breed is concerned about the city’s large homeless population, and in particular those addicted to drugs who are not cooperating with social-distancing practices. The city has expanded shelter capacity to spread out people living in them, as well as invested more money in cleaning shelters. But it has not broken up tent cities of homeless people on the advice of the CDC, and Breed said many workers are now more reluctant to interact with homeless people who are refusing to adhere to social distancing. “It’s gonna be difficult,” she said. (Breed was right to be worried: After we spoke, the city announced that an outbreak at one of its largest homeless shelters had infected 70 residents and staff with the coronavirus.) As for her city’s overall situation, its relative calm in the national storm, Breed is ambivalent, even nervous. She’s worried that good news will beget bad news, that the story of San Francisco’s success will lead its homebound citizens to relax at the very moment they must stay hunkered down. “San Franciscans are complying and people have been incredible with following this order. But on another note, there are a lot of folks who are not,” Breed admitted. “And I am not comfortable letting up.”  We want to hear what you think about this article.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose state has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, said on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday that the state “has flattened the curve” without “draconian orders” like other states.

DeSantis issued a statewide stay-at-home order earlier this month and was one of the last governors to do so in an attempt to curb the rate of infection in his state during the global coronavirus pandemic.

“I got to give credit to the people of Florida,” DeSantis said on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday.

He noted that six weeks ago, many critics were claiming that “Florida was going to be worse than New York.”

“It was constant, people saying that,” he added, acknowledging his state’s large elderly population, who medical experts believe are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19.

“If you look at what’s happened, that's not true,” DeSantis said. “New York, for example, has about 25 times the number of fatalities of Florida.”

“Right now, as of last night, we had 730 people statewide in the ICU,” he went on to say. “People said our hospitals are going to be overrun. We’ve actually increased hospital bed space and ICU bed space during the pandemic so there were fewer beds available in Florida in February than there are now.”

THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, STATE-BY-STATE

As of Tuesday, Florida reported more than 27,058 COVID-19 cases and 823 deaths, according to Florida’s COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard.

New York has reported more than 247,000 coronavirus cases and more than 14,000 deaths, according to New York’s Department of Health.

“Florida has flattened the curve,” DeSantis said. “People have done a great job and I think we understand that you can do both, you can continue to fight COVID-19, but also get people back to work and have society function again.”

“I never did draconian orders here like you see in some of these other states where dad would get arrested or get cited for taking his daughter to the park. That doesn't work. We’ve never done that. We’ve been very, I think, reasonable with the people of Florida and they’ve responded,” he continued.

On Monday, DeSantis appointed some of Florida’s most powerful political leaders and business executives to a committee that will map out the state’s reopening from the coronavirus shutdown.

DeSantis appointments include several Florida mayors and the incoming state Senate president and House speaker. He also tapped executives from Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, AT&T, Florida Power & Light, Publix, among others from the private sector.

“We have a great task force with people from all over the state of Florida and all the different industries, particularly small business and we’re putting together a lot of great ideas for what the next phase looks like in Florida,” DeSantis said on Tuesday.

Flu cases continued to mount until finally, on October 3, schools, churches, theaters, and public gathering spaces were shut down. Just two weeks after the first reported case, there were at least 20,000 more.

The 1918 flu, also known as the Spanish Flu, lasted until 1920 and is considered the deadliest pandemic in modern history. Today, as the world grinds to a halt in response to the coronavirus, scientists and historians are studying the 1918 outbreak for clues to the most effective way to stop a global pandemic. The efforts implemented then to stem the flu’s spread in cities across America—and the outcomes—may offer lessons for battling today’s crisis. (Get the latest facts and information about COVID-19.)

From its first known U.S. case, at a Kansas military base in March 1918, the flu spread across the country. Shortly after health measures were put in place in Philadelphia, a case popped up in St. Louis. Two days later, the city shut down most public gatherings and quarantined victims in their homes. The cases slowed. By the end of the pandemic, between 50 and 100 million people were dead worldwide, including more than 500,000 Americans—but the death rate in St. Louis was less than half of the rate in Philadelphia. The deaths due to the virus were estimated to be about 358 people per 100,000 in St Louis, compared to 748 per 100,000 in Philadelphia during the first six months—the deadliest period—of the pandemic.

Dramatic demographic shifts in the past century have made containing a pandemic increasingly hard. The rise of globalization, urbanization, and larger, more densely populated cities can facilitate a virus’ spread across a continent in a few hours—while the tools available to respond have remained nearly the same. Now as then, public health interventions are the first line of defense against an epidemic in the absence of a vaccine. These measures include closing schools, shops, and restaurants; placing restrictions on transportation; mandating social distancing, and banning public gatherings. (This is how small groups can save lives during a pandemic.)

Of course, getting citizens to comply with such orders is another story: In 1918, a San Francisco health officer shot three people when one refused to wear a mandatory face mask. In Arizona, police handed out $10 fines for those caught without the protective gear. But eventually, the most drastic and sweeping measures paid off. After implementing a multitude of strict closures and controls on public gatherings, St. Louis, San Francisco, Milwaukee, and Kansas City responded fastest and most effectively: Interventions there were credited with cutting transmission rates by 30 to 50 percent. New York City, which reacted earliest to the crisis with mandatory quarantines and staggered business hours, experienced the lowest death rate on the Eastern seaboard.

In 2007, a study in the Journal of the American Medial Association analyzed health data from the U.S. census that experienced the 1918 pandemic, and charted the death rates of 43 U.S. cities. That same year, two studies published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sought to understand how responses influenced the disease’s spread in different cities. By comparing fatality rates, timing, and public health interventions, they found death rates were around 50 percent lower in cities that implemented preventative measures early on, versus those that did so late or not at all. The most effective efforts had simultaneously closed schools, churches, and theaters, and banned public gatherings. This would allow time for vaccine development (though a flu vaccine was not used until the 1940s) and lessened the strain on health care systems.

The studies reached another important conclusion: That relaxing intervention measures too early could cause an otherwise stabilized city to relapse. St. Louis, for example, was so emboldened by its low death rate that the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the outbreak began. A rash of new cases soon followed. Of the cities that kept interventions in place, none experienced a second wave of high death rates.

The rise of globalization, urbanization, and larger, more densely populated cities can facilitate a virus’ spread across a continent in a few hours—while the tools available to respond have remained nearly the same. Now as then, public health interventions are the first line of defense against an epidemic in the absence of a vaccine. These measures include closing schools, shops, and restaurants; placing restrictions on transportation; mandating social distancing, and banning public gatherings. ( This is how small groups can save lives during a pandemic. )  Of course, getting citizens to comply with such orders is another story: In 1918, a San Francisco health officer shot three people when one refused to wear a mandatory face mask. In Arizona, police handed out $10 fines for those caught without the protective gear. But eventually, the most drastic and sweeping measures paid off. After implementing a multitude of strict closures and controls on public gatherings, St. Louis, San Francisco, Milwaukee, and Kansas City responded fastest and most effectively: Interventions there were credited with cutting transmission rates by 30 to 50 percent. New York City, which reacted earliest to the crisis with mandatory quarantines and staggered business hours, experienced the lowest death rate on the Eastern seaboard.  In 2007, a study in the Journal of the American Medial Association analyzed health data from the U.S. census that experienced the 1918 pandemic, and charted the death rates of 43 U.S. cities. That same year, two studies published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sought to understand how responses influenced the disease’s spread in different cities. By comparing fatality rates, timing, and public health interventions, they found death rates were around 50 percent lower in cities that implemented preventative measures early on, versus those that did so late or not at all. The most effective efforts had simultaneously closed schools, churches, and theaters, and banned public gatherings. This would allow time for vaccine development (though a flu vaccine was not used until the 1940s) and lessened the strain on health care systems.  The studies reached another important conclusion: That relaxing intervention measures too early could cause an otherwise stabilized city to relapse. St. Louis, for example, was so emboldened by its low death rate that the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the outbreak began. A rash of new cases soon followed. Of the cities that kept interventions in place, none experienced a second wave of high death rates. ( See photos that capture a world paused by coronavirus. )  In 1918, the studies found, the key to flattening the curve was social distancing. And that likely remains true a century later, in the current battle against coronavirus. “[T]here is an invaluable treasure trove of useful historical data that has only just begun to be used to inform our actions,” Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen S. Morse wrote in an analysis of the data. “The lessons of 1918, if well heeded, might help us to avoid repeating the same history today.”                            Continue Reading                 "

(Liberty Tree Tavern) By Teo Armus Teo Armus Reporter on the Morning Mix team Email Bio Follow May 28, 2020 at 7:11 AM EDT For 64 days, Kevin Smith had shut down the Liberty Tree Tavern to comply with government orders. Now he was cleaning and disinfecting and removing stools to cut seating by three-quarters as he prepared to reopen the bar. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. Plexiglass screens had gone up at the supermarket checkout. His neighbors in Elgin, Tex., were still wearing masks outside, even after it was no longer mandated by the county. He did not think such a response was necessary, he said, and he wanted to push back. “Sorry, no mask allowed,” read the poster taped to the front door of his bar Friday. “Please bare with us thru the ridiculous fearful times.” As statewide coronavirus orders are easing, many stores and restaurants nationwide have taken the opposite route : They have made face coverings a requirement, kicking out those who fail to comply and even going to court to enforce their directives. Yet in the emergent culture war over masks , a handful of businesses — the Liberty Tree Tavern among them — are fashioning themselves as fortresses for the resistance. AD AD “If we’re only allowed to be at 25 percent capacity, I want them to be the 25 percent of people that aren’t p-----, that aren’t sheep,” Smith told The Washington Post. “Being scared all the time isn’t good for your health. It suppresses your immune system.” At one Kentucky gas station, no one is allowed inside the adjacent convenience store if they are wearing a mask. Near Los Angeles, a flooring store encourages hugs and handshakes while prohibiting face coverings. The owner of a campground in rural Wisconsin vowed to treat clients sporting them inside her facilities as she would “a robbery in progress.”  Alvin’s in Manchester, KY. 

Let’s spread their shame. 

Frankfort will be notified about this and a few other things. Posted by Dan Henson on Monday, May 18, 2020 Scientific and medical experts agree people should cover their faces in public to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed at least 100,000 people in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains that masks serve as an especially important safeguard in crowded spaces, where social distancing is impossible. AD AD But Smith, who said he did not believe the virus poses a serious threat, wanted to stir the pot. For years, he has run his 60-seat bar, which occupies a converted alleyway on Elgin’s main drag, just as he pleases. Smoking is permitted during karaoke nights and performances by local talent, and beers are served in black-and-white koozies that say, “Come and drink it,” playing off the Texan battle flag . A two-month shutdown from Texas officials had forced him to cancel a benefit concert for veterans and close down during the busy rush of customers who fly in to nearby Austin for South by Southwest. For three weeks, a Bastrop County rule required him to wear a face mask in public or face up to 180 days in jail. AD “Why are we having to do this?” he asked. “We’re not here to live in fear.” Masks become a flash point for protests and fights as businesses, beaches and parks reopen A town of about 10,000 people, Elgin has reported 53 coronavirus infections and one of the two deaths in the county. Even as local officials continue to encourage residents to cover their faces, Smith said he does not believe masks are necessary. AD Bartenders need to see their customers’ faces to check IDs and make sure no one gets served too many drinks, he argued. Anyone with the virus, including those who are asymptomatic, should not be coming out to begin with. Besides, he asked: How are you supposed to down a beer with a bandanna stretched across your lips? One regular at the Liberty Tree Tavern, 58-year old Charles Chamberlain, said he survived both Stage 4 cancer and the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu. He spent a full year in a Houston hospital, he told the Austin American-Statesman, before becoming so frustrated at his isolation that he cut the cancer treatment short. AD “This quarantine. … That’s not living, that’s existing,” he said. “Going to the bar, going to the lake, going swimming with your friends, barbecuing, fishing — that’s living.” AD Smith, who also ranches cattle, said his customers have social distancing built into their rural lifestyle. For now, the regulars don’t seem to mind his request. No one had been kicked out yet for disobeying the poster, and one customer’s son, who has intellectual disabilities, was allowed to keep his mask on. Chamberlain, who has been out to the Liberty Tree Tavern about three times since it reopened, plans to keep coming back. “You should have a choice of what you want to do,” he told the American-Statesman. “If I get it, I get it. If I do, I’ll deal with that.

https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495079-pence-flouts-mayo-clinic-policy-by-not-wearing-face-covering,"Vice President Pence on Tuesday visited the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where he stuck out for his decision not to wear a face covering, flouting the medical facility's policy in the process.

Pence visited the clinic in Rochester to learn about how physicians there are supporting research and treatment surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Footage of Pence standing alongside clinic staff and a patient donating blood quickly made the rounds on social media as the vice president was the lone individual in the frame not sporting a mask.

The vice president later presided over a roundtable discussion with Mayo Clinic officials to discuss their efforts to fight the coronavirus. Pence still did not wear a mask, even as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn and every other individual at the table did.

The Mayo Clinic issued guidance on April 13 requiring all patients and visitors to wear a face covering or mask in accordance with updated recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). The clinic said it would provide masks for those who did not bring their own.

The Mayo Clinic tweeted, then deleted, a message that it informed Pence of its masking policy prior to his arrival in Rochester.

""Mayo shared the masking policy with the VP’s office,"" the clinic said in an emailed statement after deleting the tweet.

Pence defended his decision to reporters traveling with him to Minnesota.

“As Vice President of the United States I'm tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,” he said, noting the CDC guidance is intended to prevent those who have the virus from spreading it.

“And since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers these incredible healthcare personnel and look them in the eye and say thank you,"" he added.

The decision has been even more noticeable as Pence resumes traveling.

Wearing a face covering

A cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. It can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.

Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.

Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.

You should wash a face covering regularly. It can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.

When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.

How a cloth covering should fit

Making your own face covering

Using a T-shirt

You will need:

an old T-shirt that you do not want anymore (ideally size small or extra small)

scissors

Step 1: Cut a straight line across the width of the T-shirt (front and back) approximately 20cm from the bottom of the T-shirt.

Step 2: From a point 2cm below the top right-hand corner of the fabric, make a 15cm horizontal cut through both sides of the fabric that is parallel to the top of the rectangle.

Step 3: Cut down towards the bottom of the fabric until you reach approximately 2cm above the bottom edge. From here, make another 15cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom of the fabric to make a rectangle that can be discarded.

Step 4: To make the ties, cut open the edge of the 2 long strips of fabric. Unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and the nose. The 4 strips act as ties to hold the cloth face covering in place and should be tied behind the head and around the neck.

A sewn cloth face covering

You will need:

two 25cm x 25cm squares of cotton fabric

two 20cm pieces of elastic (or string or cloth strips)

needle and thread

scissors

Items you need for a sewn cloth face covering

Step 1: Cut out two 25cm x 25cm squares of cotton fabric. Stack the 2 squares on top of each other.

Step 2: Fold over one side by 0.75cm and hem, then repeat on the opposite side. Make 2 channels by folding the double layer of fabric over 1.5cm along each side and stitching this down.

Step 3: Run a 20cm length of elastic (or string or cloth strip) through the wider hem on each side of the face covering. These will be the ear loops. Use a large needle to thread it through. Tie the ends tightly.

If you only have string, you can make the ties longer and tie the covering behind your head.

Step 4: Gently pull on the elastic so that the knots are tucked inside the hem. Gather the sides of the covering on the elastic and adjust so the covering fits your face. Then securely stitch the elastic in place to keep it from slipping. These elastic loops fit over the ears.

Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of 3 or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly. For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.

For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.  This information is a guide to making a simple face covering. We do not endorse any particular method and other instructions are widely available online. Always take care to use equipment safely to avoid injury. Children should only follow these instructions under the supervision of adults.          Contents        Is this page useful?

https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/19/opinion/guidance-against-wearing-masks-coronavirus-is-wrong-you-should-cover-your-face/,"While it is true that N95s and surgical masks — which have become scarce due to hoarding — should be prioritized for use by medical professionals at greatest risk for infection, the rest of us could and should wear other protective face coverings. There are compelling scientific reasons for this:

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, public health authorities have advised us that masks are not necessary and should not be used by the general public for protection against the rapidly spreading virus.

Masks work. There is widespread evidence from the field of occupational health, the SARS epidemic, and other outbreaks that wearing masks protects us from germs and interrupts the transmission of disease from sick to healthy people.

Masks are the best way to enforce the “do not touch your face” mantra we are hearing about for COVID-19. The coronavirus, like all respiratory viruses, needs to enter mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eyes to cause infection. If you can successfully block access to these critical entry points, you will avoid infection by the coronavirus, flu, and any of several hundred other respiratory viruses. Unfortunately, we humans are relatively unique among mammals in that we continuously touch our eyes, noses, and mouths for seemingly no reason every 2.5 minutes. This behavior is hard-wired and starts in utero. Let’s get real — we’re not going to be able to instantly stop doing something we’ve been doing our whole lives.

So what’s the answer? Cover your face with a mask. This will deny you access to your own face and make you conscious of how often you are tempted to touch your nose and mouth. A nonmedical mask will not protect you from a direct cough or sneeze from an infected person, but if you’re practicing good social distancing, any type of face covering is great protection from your biggest threat: your own hands.

Wearing masks is a powerful signal to others that these are not normal times, and that we all need to change our behaviors to stop a potentially devastating epidemic. Wearing a mask for the first time can be deeply uncomfortable, especially when others are not doing the same. We felt strange at first, but after a few days, we’ve become proud rather than embarrassed to wear a mask outside. If more people donned masks, it would become a social norm as well as a public health good. If we can stop handshaking to fight COVID-19, we can also end mask stigma.

Asian countries that have been successful in containing the virus without locking down society, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, routinely use masks. As of March 17, the three countries together had fewer than 1,000 cases of the coronavirus — despite having close connections to China’s Hubei province, where the epidemic originated and exploded late last year. There are many explanations for this success, including the rapid recognition of the threat, swift application of lessons learned during the 2002 SARS outbreak, and widespread testing and strict isolation of confirmed cases. But masks are also used routinely for protection against infectious diseases in these countries, and universal mask use is part of their coronavirus guidance. In Taiwan, masks are such an important first line of defense that artificial intelligence is used to create live maps of local supplies of face masks so that citizens know where to get them.

So what needs to be done here in the United States? Cover your face. Nonmedical masks should be worn by everyone going outside. Inexpensive cloth masks are available for purchase online. Alternatively, scarves, bandana-style neck gaiters, and other similar face coverings can work effectively. Masks should be placed over the mouth and nose and removed carefully, without touching the outside surface, and cloth masks should be washed frequently.

We must also encourage others to cover their faces too. We need to change our perception that masks are only for sick people and that it’s weird or shameful to wear one. Instead, donning a mask needs to be seen as a responsible action to protect the wearer’s health and the health of those in close proximity to her. If our political leaders and cultural influencers put on masks, we could change our social attitudes and norms rapidly.

This will not be easy. Adding further instructions on top of everything we are being asked to do to stop COVID-19 could lead to overload and fatigue. However, handwashing, social distancing, and doing your best not to touch your face are not enough to stop the coronavirus. For the health of your neighbor and yourself, wear a mask.

Face coverings on public transport are compulsory in England and Scotland, and will soon also be mandatory in shops in Scotland.

This is in line with updated World Health Organization (WHO) advice, which says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.

In England, they should also be worn by hospital staff, outpatients and visitors.

What are the face covering rules on public transport?

Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in England should wear a face covering to help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission.

The rules were introduced to coincide with a further easing of lockdown which was expected to increase the number of people using public transport.

Some passengers are exempt from the rules including:

Children under 11

People with disabilities

Those with breathing difficulties

Anyone travelling with someone who relies on lip reading

If it is ""reasonably necessary"" for you to eat or drink, you can remove the face covering to do so.

The rules apply only on public transport - not while waiting - but the rail industry asks people to cover their face as they enter a station.

People can be refused travel if they don't follow the rules, and can be fined as a last resort.

Public transport excludes cruise ships, school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles. However, ride-sharing company Uber is making face coverings compulsory.

What about the rest of the UK?

In Scotland, it is also compulsory to wear face coverings on all public transport, including buses, planes, ferries and taxis.

As in England, there are some exemptions. Children under five, people with breathing difficulties, and those with a physical condition which makes it hard to keep a mask in place are not required to cover their face. Drivers behind a protective shield are also exempt.

Face coverings will also be mandatory in Scottish shops from 10 July. Again, young children and people with certain health conditions will be exempt.

People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including on public transport. But the government stopped short of making their use mandatory.

Plans to make wearing face masks on public transport compulsory in Northern Ireland have been put on hold, pending legal clarification.

Where am I supposed to get a face covering?

The government has been careful to use the term ""face covering"" rather than ""face mask"".

Transport Minister Grant Shapps said passengers should wear ""the kind of face covering you can easily make at home"" - with surgical masks kept for medical use.

Image copyright Getty Images

Common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding, can be turned into face coverings.

The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own. The government has issued its own advice too.

What are the face covering rules in hospitals?

All hospital visitors and outpatients in England are being told to wear non-medical face coverings - although no-one will be denied care, and coverings will be provided by hospitals if necessary.

NHS England has lifted its suspension of hospital visiting - but rules are at the discretion of individual trusts.

Health staff have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas.

The most protective mask for health staff is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2.

What is the World Health Organization advice?

The WHO has updated its guidelines on face masks - and now recommends non-medical, fabric coverings should be worn by anyone aged under 60 on public transport and in some enclosed work environments.

It says they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"" in areas where ""physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible"".

The WHO recommends people aged over 60, or anyone of any age with an underlying health condition, should wear a medical-grade mask in those environments.

The same goes for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms (even mild) and those caring for them.

Healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care.

Do face coverings work?

Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces.

Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. This is called asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.

Scientists in Singapore suggest the contagion risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease.

There is a risk of contamination when taking a face covering on and off - the WHO has issued advice.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/politics/joe-biden-cnn-interview-trump-face-masks/index.html,"(CNN) Joe Biden called President Donald Trump ""an absolute fool"" on Tuesday for sharing a tweet that mocked the former vice president for wearing a mask Monday at a Memorial Day ceremony.

In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash in Delaware -- Biden's first in-person interview since being knocked off the campaign trail by the coronavirus pandemic -- the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Trump is fueling a cultural opposition to wearing masks when ""every leading doc in the world is saying we should wear a mask when you're in a crowd.""

""This macho stuff, for a guy -- I shouldn't get going, but it just, it costs people's lives. It's costing people's lives,"" Biden said. Trump's position amounts to ""stoking deaths,"" he said.

He added: ""Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine.""

The comment comes as Trump has sought to politicize the wearing of masks during the coronavirus crisis. Trump himself has not worn a mask during factory tours in recent weeks, even as public health experts have recommended wearing them.

Biden made his comments the day after his first public outing following two months at home in Delaware as the coronavirus pandemic has spread, forcing a halt to in-person campaign events. The former vice president and his wife Jill on Monday wore black masks as they laid a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge.

Fox News host Brit Hume tweeted a photo of Biden's face in the mask with the comment: ""This might help explain why Trump doesn't like to wear a mask in public."" Trump later retweeted Hume.

Trump has ignited controversy by not wearing masks, including at a Ford factory tour in Michigan last week, saying he'd worn one during a private portion of the visit but took it off for the tour because he ""didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" and earlier this month during a trip to a Honeywell factory in Arizona that is manufacturing masks.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said during a briefing that it was ""peculiar"" for the former vice president to don a mask outdoors because he doesn't wear one all the time at home -- though federal guidelines do not recommend masking among people living together.

""It is a bit peculiar, though, that in his basement, right next to his wife, he's not wearing a mask. But he's wearing one outdoors when he's socially distant. So I think that there was a discrepancy there,"" McEnany said during Tuesday's White House press briefing.

In the interview with CNN, Biden also responded to Trump and his reelection campaign's frequent suggestions that Biden is senile or has lost a step.

Asked how he would answer those attacks, Biden said: ""Watch me.""

""Look, I mean, talk about a guy who's missing a step,"" he said of Trump. ""He's missing something, man.""

And he criticized Trump for repeatedly lying about voter fraud. Trump in recent weeks has railed against the use of mail-in ballots, which some states are seeking to use in increased numbers amid the coronavirus crisis. On Tuesday, the President tweeted in response to California pushing to expand voting by mail, ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.""

Biden noted that Trump himself has voted by mail in Florida.

""This is a guy that sits in the Oval Office, throws off his absentee mail-in ballot and sends it to Florida to vote in the primary. Now why is that not something that is susceptible to fraud?"" Biden said.

""There's no evidence at all"" of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in ballots, Biden said.

Biden's campaign on Tuesday said it had hired Rachana Desai Martin as its national director for voter protection, a move that comes ahead of what's likely to be a fight over voting methods and access as Trump turns the Republican Party -- which in some states has sought expanded vote-by-mail options -- against allowing votes be cast by mail.

Biden also addressed the controversy over his comments in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, an African American host of the popular nationally syndicated morning radio show ""The Breakfast Club,"" that if black voters ""have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.""

Biden had sought to walk back that comment hours afterward, and Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the top-ranking African American in the House and a close Biden ally, said on ABC's ""The View"" Tuesday that he ""cringed, no question about that"" when he heard Biden's remark.

""First of all, you know, it was a mistake, number one. And I was smiling when he asked me the question. I shouldn't have been such a wise guy with him. He was being a wise guy and I responded,"" Biden told Bash.

He said he has ""never, never once"" taken the African American community for granted, and that ""I've got to make it clear why I think I deserve their look.""

Biden said he was ""never going to stoop to where"" Trump is, and that the President ""says so many outrageous things.""

He said he noted to a friend who is a prominent African American recently that Trump -- who has fueled baseless ""Obamagate"" conspiracy theories on Twitter in recent weeks -- was attacking former President Barack Obama.

""I said, 'Why is he going after Barack?' He said, 'Because it stirs up his base. Barack is a black man,'"" Biden said.

But he also said some Democrats who have urged Biden to stop apologizing for gaffes like the one on ""The Breakfast Club"" given Trump's history of racist actions are wrong.

""When I say something that is understandably in retrospect offensive to someone -- and legitimately offensive, making it look like I take them for granted -- I should apologize,"" Biden said.

Biden also addressed his search for a running mate, saying his vice presidential search committee has interviewed ""a lot"" of the people under consideration to be his potential running mate.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee would not commit to choosing a woman of color as his running mate, saying that ""we haven't gotten there yet.""","                       Donald Trump Supreme Court Congress Facts First 2020 Election Edition U.S. International Arabic Español Donald Trump Supreme Court Congress Facts First 2020 Election Search Edition U.S. International Arabic Español World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics Donald Trump Supreme Court Congress Facts First 2020 Election Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Health Food Fitness Wellness Parenting Vital Signs Entertainment Stars Screen Binge Culture Media Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food and Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Equestrian Golf Skiing Horse Racing Motorsport Formula E Esports Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Weather Climate Storm Tracker Video Follow CNN Politics      Biden blasts Trump for mocking face masks By Eric Bradner , CNN Updated 0112 GMT (0912 HKT) May 27, 2020 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Cuomo: Trump denying reality does not defeat reality Ex-FBI deputy director: Here's what briefing Trump is like (CNN) Joe Biden called President Donald Trump ""an absolute fool"" on Tuesday for sharing a tweet that mocked the former vice president for wearing a mask Monday at a Memorial Day ceremony. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash in Delaware -- Biden's first in-person interview since being knocked off the campaign trail by the coronavirus pandemic -- the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Trump is fueling a cultural opposition to wearing masks when ""every leading doc in the world is saying we should wear a mask when you're in a crowd."" ""This macho stuff, for a guy -- I shouldn't get going, but it just, it costs people's lives. It's costing people's lives,"" Biden said. Trump's position amounts to ""stoking deaths,"" he said. He added: ""Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine."" The comment comes as Trump has sought to politicize the wearing of masks during the coronavirus crisis. Trump himself has not worn a mask during factory tours in recent weeks, even as public health experts have recommended wearing them. Read More View 2020 presidential election polling Biden made his comments the day after his first public outing following two months at home in Delaware as the coronavirus pandemic has spread, forcing a halt to in-person campaign events. The former vice president and his wife Jill on Monday wore black masks as they laid a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Fox News host Brit Hume tweeted a photo of Biden's face in the mask with the comment: ""This might help explain why Trump doesn't like to wear a mask in public."" Trump later retweeted Hume. Trump has ignited controversy by not wearing masks, including at a Ford factory tour in Michigan last week, saying he'd worn one during a private portion of the visit but took it off for the tour because he ""didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" and earlier this month during a trip to a Honeywell factory in Arizona that is manufacturing masks. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said during a briefing that it was ""peculiar"" for the former vice president to don a mask outdoors because he doesn't wear one all the time at home -- though federal guidelines do not recommend masking among people living together. ""It is a bit peculiar, though, that in his basement, right next to his wife, he's not wearing a mask. But he's wearing one outdoors when he's socially distant. So I think that there was a discrepancy there,"" McEnany said during Tuesday's White House press briefing. In the interview with CNN, Biden also responded to Trump and his reelection campaign's frequent suggestions that Biden is senile or has lost a step. Asked how he would answer those attacks, Biden said: ""Watch me."" ""Look, I mean, talk about a guy who's missing a step,"" he said of Trump. ""He's missing something, man."" And he criticized Trump for repeatedly lying about voter fraud. Trump in recent weeks has railed against the use of mail-in ballots, which some states are seeking to use in increased numbers amid the coronavirus crisis. On Tuesday, the President tweeted in response to California pushing to expand voting by mail, ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed."" Biden noted that Trump himself has voted by mail in Florida. ""This is a guy that sits in the Oval Office, throws off his absentee mail-in ballot and sends it to Florida to vote in the primary. Now why is that not something that is susceptible to fraud?"" Biden said. ""There's no evidence at all"" of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in ballots, Biden said.

Wearing face coverings will be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, the transport secretary has said.

Grant Shapps said ""every precaution"" must be taken as passenger numbers were expected to increase when lockdown measures were eased further.

Coverings must be worn on buses, trams, trains, coaches, aircraft and ferries.

Very young children, disabled people and those with breathing difficulties would be exempt, he said.

It comes as the UK recorded the deaths of another 176 people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in the UK to 39,904.

Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Shapps said face coverings would be ""a condition of travel"" and not wearing one could ""ultimately"" lead to a fine.

But he added: ""Why wouldn't people want to do the right thing?""

He said surgical masks must be kept for clinical settings and instead travellers should wear the kind of face covering that could be made at home. They should cover the mouth and nose and can be as simple as a scarf or bandanna tied snugly behind the head.

Mr Shapps also stressed that social distancing and regular hand washing were still the most important measures to prevent the disease spreading.

The rule change coincides with the planned reopening of non-essential retail and return of some secondary school pupils in England from 15 June, which Mr Shapps said would put ""more pressure"" on the public transport network.

The British Medical Association (BMA), however, has questioned why the government was waiting until mid-June to bring in the new measure, saying the risk of the virus would be ""much less"" if it was brought in straight away.

The doctors' union also said it would like to see compulsory face coverings in other areas of public life, where social distancing was not possible, and suggested the government should supply the public with face coverings.

Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government was considering whether to make it mandatory to wear face coverings in some situations.

Scotland currently recommends wearing coverings in shops and on public transport.

In Wales, face coverings have not yet been recommended for the general public. In Northern Ireland, people have been told to consider wearing them in places where they cannot observe social distancing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently says only two groups of people should wear protective masks - those who are sick and showing symptoms and those who are caring for people with suspected coronavirus.

The WHO does not usually recommend them for the public because they can be contaminated by other people's coughs and sneezes, or when putting them on, or taking them off.

'A potentially useful extra tool'

Research on face coverings has been described as ""slim"" by many authorities, and for health professionals there's always been the fear of a rush to snap up medical-grade masks.

But studies in laboratories have shown not only how far droplets can be spread by coughs but also how various kinds of materials can dramatically reduce how many of those droplets do get through.

For the US government, the deciding factor was the risk of the virus being spread by people who do not realise they are carrying it.

For others, it's been a sense of altruism: A homemade mask will not do a great job of protecting you but may reduce the chances of you infecting others.

And if enough people follow that advice, the risks of the infection spreading are brought down.

There have been passionate disagreements over this within the world of science.

And even advocates would agree that the public wearing masks will not defeat the virus on its own; but it's a potentially useful extra tool as we come out of lockdown.

The government said it expects the ""vast majority"" of people to comply with the changes but operators will be able to issue penalty fines for those who do not, in a similar way to people who travel without a ticket.

British Transport Police will help implement the new rules.

But Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he was not expecting a ""huge surge"" in staff policing these new rules.

""I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others,"" he said at the Downing Street briefing.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was pleased ""the government has finally seen sense"" after he had lobbied for the change.

Unions had been pushing for compulsory face coverings after dozens of transport workers died after contracting Covid-19.

Welcoming the announcement, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said it was a ""sensible step"" which would help to ease concerns of travellers.

However, Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said it was ""long overdue"" and face coverings alone were ""nowhere near enough"" to protect passengers and workers.

Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said this latest move was ""just another example of the government being slow to act"".

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has told a global vaccine summit, hosted by the UK, that finding a coronavirus inoculation will require cooperation ""on a scale beyond anything we have seen before"".

His comments came as the global vaccine alliance raised nearly $9bn (£7bn) at a virtual summit in London, more than their target.

The money will be used to immunise millions of children against diseases such as polio, measles and diptheria.

How to protect others

The best thing you can do to prevent spreading COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. If none is available, use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

To protect others, you should also:

stay at home if you are ill

maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others when physical distancing cannot be maintained, consider wearing a non-medical mask or homemade face covering

avoid touching your face, mouth, nose or eyes

Wearing a homemade non-medical mask/facial covering in the community is recommended for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public settings, such as:

stores

shopping areas

public transportation

Public health officials will make recommendations based on a number of factors, including the rates of infection and/or transmission in the community. Recommendations may vary from location to location.

Wearing a mask alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and physical (social) distancing.

Appropriate use of non-medical mask or face covering

When worn properly, a person wearing a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of his or her own infectious respiratory droplets.

Non-medical face masks or face coverings should:

allow for easy breathing

fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops

maintain their shape after washing and drying

be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty

be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment

be made of at least 2 layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen)

be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping

Some masks also include a pocket to accommodate a paper towel or disposable coffee filter, for increased benefit.

Non-medical masks or face coverings should:

not be shared with others

not impair vision or interfere with tasks

not be placed on children under the age of 2 years

not be made of plastic or other non-breathable materials

not be secured with tape or other inappropriate materials

not be made exclusively of materials that easily fall apart, such as tissues

not be placed on anyone unable to remove them without assistance or anyone who has trouble breathing

Download the poster on the do’s and don’ts of wearing a non-medical mask or face covering.

Limitations

Homemade masks are not medical devices and are not regulated like medical masks and respirators:

they have not been tested to recognized standards

the fabrics are not the same as used in surgical masks or respirators

the edges are not designed to form a seal around the nose and mouth

These types of masks may not be effective in blocking virus particles that may be transmitted by coughing, sneezing or certain medical procedures. They do not provide complete protection from virus particles because of a potential loose fit and the materials used.

Some commercially available masks have exhalation valves that make the mask more breathable for the person wearing it, but these valves also allow infectious respiratory droplets to spread outside the mask.

Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended, because they don't protect others from COVID-19 and don't limit the spread of the virus.

Medical masks, including surgical, medical procedure face masks and respirators (like N95 masks), must be kept for health care workers and others providing direct care to COVID-19 patients.

If none is available, use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  To protect others, you should also:   stay at home if you are ill  maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others  when physical distancing cannot be maintained, consider wearing a non-medical mask or homemade face covering    avoid touching your face, mouth, nose or eyes   Wearing a homemade non-medical mask/facial covering in the community is recommended for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public settings, such as:   stores  shopping areas  public transportation   Public health officials will make recommendations based on a number of factors, including the rates of infection and/or transmission in the community. Recommendations may vary from location to location.  Wearing a mask alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures , including frequent hand washing and physical (social) distancing .  Appropriate use of non-medical mask or face covering  When worn properly, a person wearing a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of his or her own infectious respiratory droplets.  Non-medical face masks or face coverings should :   allow for easy breathing  fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops  maintain their shape after washing and drying  be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty  be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment  be made of at least 2 layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen)  be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping   Some masks also include a pocket to accommodate a paper towel or disposable coffee filter, for increased benefit.

Limitations  Homemade masks are not medical devices and are not regulated like medical masks and respirators:   they have not been tested to recognized standards  the fabrics are not the same as used in surgical masks or respirators  the edges are not designed to form a seal around the nose and mouth   These types of masks may not be effective in blocking virus particles that may be transmitted by coughing, sneezing or certain medical procedures. They do not provide complete protection from virus particles because of a potential loose fit and the materials used.  Some commercially available masks have exhalation valves that make the mask more breathable for the person wearing it, but these valves also allow infectious respiratory droplets to spread outside the mask.  Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended, because they don't protect others from COVID-19 and don't limit the spread of the virus.

The recommendation, if approved, would call for Americans to use cloth coverings instead of surgical and N95 masks, which have been in short supply at hospitals and medical facilities across the country, the Post noted, adding that the coverings could potentially lower the risk of an infected person transmitting the virus.

Talks are still ongoing, an anonymous federal official confirmed to the newspaper.

A second official said that the recommendation could help “flatten the curve” of the virus's spread.

The CDC does not currently recommend that healthy people wear masks or coverings over their face, instead recommending that everyone engage in social distancing and stand at least six feet apart.

Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb recommended the change as the lead author of a pandemic response plan published Sunday by the American Enterprise Institute. The report says that “everyone, including people without symptoms, should be encouraged to wear nonmedical fabric face masks while in public.”

During an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, he said people should consider wearing a cotton mask, adding: “We should be putting out guidelines from the CDC on how you can develop a mask on your own.”

However, some worry that a mask could become contaminated and not be properly cleaned or disposed of, leading to transmission of the coronavirus, the Post reported.

Ilhem Messaoudi, a University of California at Irvine epidemiologist, told the newspaper that the virus is spread through heavy respiratory droplets.

“Given the shortage of PPE available to our healthcare workforce, it is irresponsible for anyone to suggest that we should all don masks, reducing the supply for nurses and physicians who do not have the luxury of treating symptomatic, very sick patients from 6 feet away,” Messaoudi said.

“Homemade masks theoretically could offer some protection if the materials and fit were optimized, but this is uncertain,” Jeffrey Duchin, a top health official in Seattle and King County, Wash., told the Post. “It’s also possible that mask-wearing might increase the risk for infection if other recommendations (like hand washing and distancing) are less likely to be followed or if the mask is contaminated and touched.”

“Well-designed homemade or commercially manufactured masks for the public that did not draw on the supply needed by healthcare workers could potentially provide some protection,” he added.","                                                        Skip to main content         sign up for newsletters  Home  News Senate  House  Campaign  Administration  Business  Regulation  Media  Briefing Room  State Watch  Latino  Polls  12:30 Report  Coronavirus Report  Politics 101  Floor Action  In The Know  Sunday Talk Shows   Policy Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security   Regulation Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security   Opinion Contributors  Columnists  Become a contributor  Congress Blog   Hill.TV  Video Campaign  Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security  Sunday Shows  Events  Lawmaker Interviews   Podcasts HillCast  HistoryCast   Print Edition  Events Upcoming Events  Past Events  About   People  Campaign    Follow Us  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn    TheHill.com © 1996-2020 News Communication Terms & Conditions  Privacy Policy                Top menu  News Senate  House  Administration  Campaign  Business  Regulation  Media  Briefing Room  State Watch  Latino  Polls  12:30 Report  Coronavirus Report  Politics 101  Floor Action  In The Know  Sunday Talk Shows   Policy Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security   Opinion Columnists  Congress Blog   All Contributors  - Campaign  - Civil Rights  - Criminal Justice  - Education  - Energy & Environment  - Finance  - Healthcare  - Immigration  - International  - Judiciary  - Technology  - White House  - Become A Contributor    Events Upcoming Events  About   Jobs  HILL.TV  Changing America Respect  Sustainability  Enrichment  Resilience  Well-Being   Coronavirus Report       Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn     Search form   Search                 TRENDING:  Coronavirus  russian bounties  Donald Trump  Joe Biden                      CDC may urge Americans to cover faces in public: report   By Marina Pitofsky - 03/31/20 07:48 AM EDT                                                            The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may urge Americans to cover their faces in public to protect themselves and others amid the coronavirus pandemic, The Washington Post is reporting .

https://medium.com/@adrien.burch/whats-the-evidence-on-face-masks-5f3c27a18cc,"What Research Is Relevant?

Covid-19 is a brand-new disease, which means scientists are still scrambling to learn the basics, including how to best prevent its transmission. This lack of data is why we must look at other, closely related examples for guidance.

Although Covid-19 is a novel disease, it is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is closely related to the virus that caused the SARS epidemic 17 years ago. However, since Covid-19’s true genetic identity was not widely publicized until recently, influenza research probably shaped doctors’ initial opinions about face masks instead. What does the actual science say about SARS?

Can face masks offer protection against SARS?

According to research on the SARS epidemic, face masks were the most consistently effective intervention for reducing the contraction and spread of SARS. In a Cochrane Review on the subject, six out of seven studies showed that face masks (surgical and N95) offered significant protection against SARS. Hand washing was also very effective, supported by four out of seven studies in a multivariate analysis.

Although most of the studies in the Cochrane Review were on medical workers in a hospital setting, one study followed community transmission of SARS in Beijing. It found that consistently wearing a mask in public was associated with a 70% reduction in the risk of catching SARS. Additionally, the authors of the paper noted that most people in the community wore simple surgical masks, not N95 respirators.

This may be why public health agencies in many other countries encourage — or even require — the general public to wear face masks. It may also be why the CDC currently recommends that we wear face masks while in the same room as a sick family member who is not wearing a mask.

Of course, one of the most important takeaways from this data is that our hospital workers are in extreme danger given the current face mask shortage. Additionally, it is essential that we learn how to properly wear a mask, since another review on SARS health care workers emphasizes that face masks offer the most protection when they are used consistently and worn properly.

Can face masks offer protection against the flu?

In general, influenza reviews are more in line with current advice about prioritizing hand washing. Whereas most influenza studies are consistent about handwashing being good, they are somewhat inconsistent about face masks being helpful. Most studies in the above-linked influenza review found face masks to be useful protection against influenza, although the following two studies had contrasting results.

One study showed that children who improperly used masks caught H1N1 2% more often than children who didn’t wear masks (not statistically significant, if you are wondering). However, since the children in the study who wore face masks correctly cut their risks in half, the researchers suggested they should all be taught proper mask technique. The other study found an increased risk associated with wearing face masks, but based its conclusions on only 14 cases of H1N1.

Another frequently referenced review on face masks and influenza states the familiar warning that masks could increase your risk of transmission. However, their cited evidence is not a research study, but a WHO info sheet about face masks that makes the same claim — without any citations to back up the claim.

Aren’t viruses so small that they can pass through a face mask?

If Covid-19 was floating in the air, free of fluid, it would be around 100 nanometers in size. N95 respirators can only filter out 95% of particles sized 100–300 nanometers. Surgical masks offer even less protection. So the answer is yes — viruses can technically pass through both types of face masks.

But will they? That is less certain. When a person coughs, the droplets are typically somewhere between 8,000–100,000 nanometers in diameter. *Aerosols, the smallest respiratory droplets, are only estimated to comprise 0.00024% of the total volume of liquid expelled during a cough. Most droplets, especially the large ones, will quickly settle and end up on surfaces. The smaller droplets stay in the air longer — but are still large enough that a properly-fitted N95 mask could filter them out, since N95 masks are 99.5% effective against particles sized 750 nanometers or bigger.

*Influenza research finds that simple surgical masks can reduce the number of exhaled viruses in large droplets by 96%, and in aerosols by 64%. Another recent paper also confirms that simple surgical masks can reduce the detection of seasonal coronavirus in both aerosols and larger droplets. (For a deeper dive on aerosols and droplets, read my article about airborne viruses.)

Since most virus-containing fluid will end up on surfaces, it remains important to wash our hands regularly and avoid touching our faces when in public. One of the strongest arguments in favor of both surgical and N95 masks is that they help prevent us from touching our faces with dirty hands when used correctly.

Face masks might offer some protection from airborne viruses in droplets, especially if the droplets that carry them remain a large-enough size. But if you are in a dry climate and the liquid evaporates before the droplets can settle, Covid-19 might end up in a droplet that is too small to be filtered by a face mask. Also, researchers have warned that SARS could be aerosolized (made into a very tiny droplet) by nebulizer therapy and CPAP machines, which would help it penetrate face masks. This warning might be important for hospitals and nursing homes.

Are N95 respirators more effective than surgical masks?

There is an ongoing scientific debate as to how much benefit comes from wearing N95 respirators instead of surgical masks. When used properly, N95 might offer more protection since it filters out smaller particles (discussed above) and also creates a tighter seal against the wearer’s face than a surgical mask. On the other hand, N95 masks are less comfortable, are frequently misused, and are taken off more often than a surgical mask.

Theoretically, N95 respirators might be a better choice if you are taking care of someone with Covid-19. When used properly in a medical setting, N95 respirators were more effective against SARS than surgical masks in three different studies.

However, when moved out of a hospital setting and into everyday life, those differences could even out. If we look at the data on influenza, reviews typically conclude that N95 respirators are not significantly more effective than surgical masks. This is likely why the public is being advised against wearing N95 masks.

*Recent concerns have been raised about N95 respirators and other particulate masks with exhalation valves. These valves are designed to make the mask more comfortable for the wearer, but offer no protection to others if the wearer is infected. It’s currently recommended to either not wear masks with valves in public — or to wear a fabric mask over valved masks.

What about fabric masks?

Of course, stores are sold out of both surgical and N95 masks, which means that homemade masks are the only option remaining for many of us. Even hospitals are using and requesting homemade fabric masks — that’s how bad this shortage is. Although none of the above research applies to fabric masks, there is a little bit of research on this topic.

An important thing to keep in mind is that every cloth will have a different weave, which allows larger or smaller particles to pass through. As you might imagine, researchers find that N95 respirators are more effective than cloth at preventing small particles from passing through. However, fabric masks might be comparable to some surgical masks.

*To my knowledge, only one research article has tested fabric masks against surgical masks in a clinical setting. They found that nurses and doctors wearing surgical masks got sick less often than those wearing fabric masks. Although I do not question this article’s data and agree that the surgical masks outperformed the fabric masks used in this experiment, I do want to point out:

The authors’ financial ties to 3M

99.6% of the “control” population wore masks (cloth, surgical or N95) when appropriate

Medical workers wearing cloth masks treated up to 661 patients during the experiment, while the “control” group maxed out at 199 patients — which means the most active cloth mask wearers were exposed to 3 times the risk of their “control” counterparts

The cloth chosen for this experiment had a much worse filtration efficiency than the material used in the surgical masks

85% of the confirmed illnesses in this study were due to the common cold (rhinovirus) which, according to recent research, penetrates surgical masks much more effectively than influenza or coronavirus

The authors of the study have issued a public statement emphasizing that all health workers should wear respiratory protection, and that a cloth mask might offer protection when disposable masks are unavailable

If you do wear a fabric mask, treat it as you would a disposable mask and don’t reuse it without ensuring it has been sterilized. Fabric mask disinfection is not an active research topic, but the standard wisdom of running it through a long, hot wash is supported by research showing that the SARS virus can be inactivated by high heat and detergent. UV light can also be used against SARS, but since the light needs to reach the virus in order to inactivate it, UV might not effectively sterilize porous fabric.

What are the dangers of wearing a face mask

Most importantly, we don’t want our nation’s supply of face masks to be depleted while we’re still in the early stages of the pandemic and our risks are relatively low. Maintaining the health of our medical workers is essential at this stage.

While wearing a mask, you might end up touching your face more often and transferring the virus from your hands to your face. In order to avoid this, wash your hands both before and after adjusting or removing your face mask.

If your mask becomes moist against your skin, viruses could diffuse across the mask and reach your face. If you are a medical worker or taking care of someone who is sick, this is very important. However, since viruses are not alive and cannot replicate outside of a living cell, there is no risk that a face mask will somehow increase the quantity of viruses you are potentially exposed to. Any quantity of viruses that diffuse across a wet face mask will still be fewer compared to if you weren’t wearing a face mask.

Used face masks need to be sterilized or disposed of properly. Hospitals are currently figuring out ways to sterilize and reuse disposable face masks. If you are disinfecting multiple face masks, make sure that the wearers’ names are written on the masks and never used by anyone else. Ethylene oxide or heat treatment at 70C/160F for 30 minutes might be the best options for sterilizing porous face masks.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing,"On 23 June, the Prime Minister announced changes to lockdown measures that would apply from 4 July. Guidance on what this means can be found here.

Everyone’s actions have helped to reduce the transmission of coronavirus in our communities. Fatalities and infection rates continue to fall.

The government has set out its plan to return life to as near normal as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly and fairly as possible in order to safeguard livelihoods, but in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS. The most important thing we can continue to do is to stay alert, control the virus, and, in doing so, save lives.

This guidance applies in England – people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should follow the specific rules in those parts of the UK.

At this stage of our recovery strategy:

You can spend time outdoors, including private gardens and other outdoor spaces, in groups of up to six people from different households, following social distancing guidelines

You should go to work if you cannot work from home and your business has not been required to close by law

Children in early years (age 0-5), reception, year 1 and year 6 can return to childcare or school in line with the arrangements made by their school

You can be tested as part of the test and trace programme, which will enable us to return to normal life as soon as possible, by helping to control transmission risks

From 13 June, you will now also be able to:

Form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household if you live alone or are a single parent with dependent children - in other words, you are in a household where there is only one adult

Attend a place of worship for individual prayer

From 15 June:

You will be able to visit more shops and additional outdoor attractions - drive-in cinemas and animal attractions like zoos, farms and safari parks

Year 10 and 12 pupils in secondary schools and further education colleges will begin to receive some face to face support.

You will have to wear a face covering on public transport

If, after lifting restrictions, the government sees a concerning rise in the infection rate, then it may have to re-impose some restrictions in as targeted a way as possible.

That is why you should stay alert and follow social distancing guidelines. You must not:

gather outdoors in groups of more than six people with people you do not live with (except for limited circumstances) or, from 13 June, people that are not in your support bubble (if applicable)

visit friends or family inside their home or any other indoor place, except for the limited set of circumstances set out in law or from 13 June if they are in your support bubble

stay away from your home or your support bubble household overnight - including holidays - except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work purposes

This guidance explains the measures that will help you to stay alert and safe as we continue to respond to the challenges of coronavirus. Key parts of these measures are underpinned by law, which sets out clearly what you must and must not do – every person in the country must continue to comply with this. The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce the law – including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

Find answers to the most frequently asked questions about what you should and should not do during the coronavirus outbreak on our FAQs page.

1. Protecting different groups of people

This guidance is for the general public who are fit and well. There is separate, specific guidance on isolation for households with a possible coronavirus infection.

Some people, including those aged 70 and over, those with specific chronic pre-existing conditions and pregnant women, are clinically vulnerable, meaning they are at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. As we begin to ease restrictions, this group who are clinically vulnerable – see section 9 – should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their household.

There is a further group of people who are defined, also on medical grounds, as clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus – that is, people with specific serious health conditions. They are advised to continue shielding to keep themselves safe by staying at home and avoiding gatherings or, if individuals wish to spend time outdoors, to take extra care to minimise contact with others by keeping two metres apart at all times.

2. Meeting family and friends

You should continue to stay alert and limit your contact with others. Staying at home is the easiest way to do this. However, we know that it has been difficult for people to be cut off from their family and friends in recent months.

In England, from 13 June, there will be two ways that you can see people outside of your household. In doing so, it’s important to continue to take the necessary precautions to minimise the risk of spreading infection:

You are already able to meet outdoors in a group of up to six people (including people you don’t live with), whilst observing social distancing guidelines and keeping at least 2 metres apart

From 13 June, single adult households - in other words adults who live alone or with dependent children only - can form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household. All those in a support bubble will be able to spend time together inside each other’s homes, including overnight, without needing to stay 2 metres apart. Individuals may only form a support bubble with one other household. We are making this targeted change to support those who might be feeling lonely or isolated, while ensuring we continue to keep the rate of transmission down

You must not:

Meet other people indoors - including in their home or your home - unless you are in a support bubble (from 13 June), or for other limited circumstances set out in law

If you are part of a support bubble, visit anyone else in another household outside of your support bubble

Meet outdoors in a group of more than six, with people who are not in your household or (where applicable) support bubble

Form a support bubble (from 13 June) with another household if neither you nor they are in a single adult household

Stay overnight in another household that is not in your support bubble (from 13 June and where applicable), unless it is for the limited set of circumstances already outlined in law

The more people you have interactions with, the more chances we give the virus to spread. Therefore, try to limit the number of people you see - especially over short periods of time. Those who are eligible to form a support bubble, should only do so exclusively with one other household.

Further guidance on how to see your friends and family safely can be found here.

When you leave your home, you should follow the guidelines on staying safe outside your home. Most importantly, this includes the key advice that you should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of your household or support bubble (where applicable). Face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if you are in an enclosed space where social distancing is difficult and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. From 15 June face coverings must be worn on public transport, as set out in law.

If you or someone in your household or, from 13 June, your support bubble (if applicable) are showing coronavirus symptoms, everyone in your support bubble should stay home. If you or a member of your support bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme, the individual contacted must stay at home. If the individual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the support bubble must then isolate. This is critical to staying safe and saving lives.

By following this guidance, you are helping to protect yourself, your family, the NHS and your community.

Further guidance on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been issued.

3. Returning to school

The Government has announced the intention to implement a phased return for early years settings and schools, and has provided guidance on the return of children to schools and childcare. Schools are now open for early years (aged 0-5), Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 groups, subject to local arrangements. From 15 June, secondary schools and further education colleges will also begin some face to face support with Year 10 and 12 pupils.

You can find out more about the Government’s approach to education and how schools are preparing.

School places of all age groups remain available to the children of critical workers.

4. Going to the shops

The Government has announced that non-essential retail stores will be able to reopen from 15 June. They are expected to follow COVID-19 Secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers.

This means that all shops on the high street can now open.

You must only visit shops with people you live with or, if applicable, people in your support bubble and you should practise social distancing from other people at all times.

5. Other businesses and venues

For the time being, certain other businesses and venues will still be required by law to stay closed to the public, subject to the limited exceptions. From 15 June, these include:

Restaurants, cafes and pubs, other than for takeaway

Cinemas (other than drive-in cinemas), theatres and nightclubs

Hair, beauty and nail salons

libraries (apart from click and collect services), community centres, and youth centres

indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, gyms, arcades and soft play facilities

outdoor attractions such as funfairs and theme parks

some communal places within parks, such as playgrounds and outdoor gyms

places of worship (except for funerals and for the purposes of individual prayer)

hotels, hostels, bed and breakfasts, campsites, caravan parks, and boarding houses for commercial/leisure use, excluding use by those who live in them permanently, those who are unable to return home, critical workers where their need is for a work purpose, elite athletes and those needing to self-isolate after arriving in the UK

See a list of businesses that remain closed (from 15 June). Other businesses can remain open and their employees can travel to work, where they cannot work from home.

6. Visiting public places

You can spend time outdoors, including exercise, as often as you wish. This must be with people you live with or, if applicable, from 13 June, your support bubble, or in a gathering of up to six, which can include people from outside your household. You should keep two metres apart from people not in your household or support bubble at all times.

You should continue to avoid public transport other than for essential journeys so should make journeys by cycling, walking or driving in a private vehicle where possible.

You may travel to outdoor publicly accessible open spaces irrespective of distance with people in your household, and from 13 June, your support bubble, but should follow social distancing guidance while you are there. You should plan ahead to ensure that, where you are visiting places like National Parks, beaches or zoos, you have checked that they are open and appropriately prepared for visitors. Many other outdoor venues where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces will remain closed as set out in the law. Campsites will remain closed and you are not allowed to stay away overnight, so should allow enough time to return home.

When travelling to outdoor spaces, it is important that people respect the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and do not travel to different parts of the UK where their intended activities there would be prohibited by legislation passed by the relevant devolved administration.

7. Going to work

With the exception of the organisations listed in this guidance on closing businesses and venues, the government has not required any other businesses to close to the public – it is important for business to carry on.

All workers who cannot work from home should travel to work if their workplace is open. Sectors of the economy that are allowed to be open should be open – such as food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientific research. As soon as practicable, workplaces should be set up to meet the new COVID-19 Secure guidelines. These will keep you as safe as possible, while allowing as many people as possible to resume their livelihoods. In particular, workplaces should, where possible, ensure employees can maintain a two metre distance from others, and wash their hands regularly.

At all times, workers should follow the guidance on self-isolation if they or anyone in their household or or, from 13 June, support bubble, shows coronavirus symptoms. You should not go into work if you are showing symptoms, or if you or any of your household or, from 13 June, support bubble, are self-isolating. This is consistent with advice from the Chief Medical Officer.

There is specific guidance in relation to work carried out in people’s homes – for example by tradespeople carrying out repairs and maintenance, cleaners, or those providing paid-for childcare in a child’s home.

8. Enforcing the law

The police and local authorities have the powers to enforce the requirements set out in law if people do not comply with them. The police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures, but if you breach the regulations, they may instruct you to disperse, leave an area, issue you with a fixed penalty notice or arrest you where they believe it necessary. They may also instruct you to take steps to stop your children breaking these legal requirements again if they have already done so.

The government has introduced higher penalties for those who do not comply, to reflect the increased risk to others of breaking the rules as we begin to ease the restrictions. If the police believe that you have broken the law – or if you refuse to follow their instructions enforcing the law – a police officer may issue you with a fixed penalty notice for £100 (reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days). If you have already received a fixed penalty notice, the amount will increase to £200 and double on each further repeat offence, up to a maximum of £3200.

9. Clinically vulnerable people

If you have any of the following health conditions, you may be clinically vulnerable, meaning you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. You are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if you do go out, take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household or support bubble.

Clinically vulnerable people are those who are:

aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)

under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (that is, anyone instructed to get a flu jab each year on medical grounds):

chronic (long-term) mild to moderate respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis

chronic heart disease, such as heart failure

chronic kidney disease

chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis

chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), or cerebral palsy

diabetes

a weakened immune system as the result of certain conditions or medicines they are taking (such as steroid tablets)

being seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above)

pregnant women

As above, there is a further category of people with serious underlying health conditions who are clinically extremely vulnerable, meaning they are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus. You, your family and carers should be aware of the guidance on shielding which provides information on how to protect yourself still further should you wish. Updated advice is available here.

10. Communicating with the public

The government will continue to keep the public informed of the impacts of coronavirus on the UK, and the law and guidance that is in place to protect the public.

The measures set out will be kept under constant review, and formally revisited at the end of June. They will be relaxed if the scientific evidence shows that this is possible. If people begin to act recklessly, which could impact on the transmission of coronavirus in our communities, further restrictions will have to be implemented again.","       Skip to main content         Tell us whether you accept cookies  We use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing        On 23 June, the Prime Minister announced changes to lockdown measures that would apply from 4 July. Guidance on what this means can be found here .  Everyone’s actions have helped to reduce the transmission of coronavirus in our communities. Fatalities and infection rates continue to fall.  The government has set out its plan to return life to as near normal as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly and fairly as possible in order to safeguard livelihoods, but in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS. The most important thing we can continue to do is to stay alert, control the virus, and, in doing so, save lives.  This guidance applies in England – people in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland should follow the specific rules in those parts of the UK.  At this stage of our recovery strategy:   You can spend time outdoors, including private gardens and other outdoor spaces, in groups of up to six people from different households, following social distancing guidelines  You should go to work if you cannot work from home and your business has not been required to close by law  Children in early years (age 0-5), reception, year 1 and year 6 can return to childcare or school in line with the arrangements made by their school  You can be tested as part of the test and trace programme , which will enable us to return to normal life as soon as possible, by helping to control transmission risks   From 13 June, you will now also be able to:   Form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household if you live alone or are a single parent with dependent children - in other words, you are in a household where there is only one adult  Attend a place of worship for individual prayer   From 15 June:   You will be able to visit more shops and additional outdoor attractions - drive-in cinemas and animal attractions like zoos, farms and safari parks  Year 10 and 12 pupils in secondary schools and further education colleges will begin to receive some face to face support.  You will have to wear a face covering on public transport   If, after lifting restrictions, the government sees a concerning rise in the infection rate, then it may have to re-impose some restrictions in as targeted a way as possible.  That is why you should stay alert and follow social distancing guidelines. You must not:   gather outdoors in groups of more than six people with people you do not live with (except for limited circumstances) or, from 13 June, people that are not in your support bubble (if applicable)  visit friends or family inside their home or any other indoor place, except for the limited set of circumstances set out in law or from 13 June if they are in your support bubble  stay away from your home or your support bubble household overnight - including holidays - except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work purposes   This guidance explains the measures that will help you to stay alert and safe as we continue to respond to the challenges of coronavirus. Key parts of these measures are underpinned by law , which sets out clearly what you must and must not do – every person in the country must continue to comply with this. The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce the law – including through fines and dispersing gatherings.  Find answers to the most frequently asked questions about what you should and should not do during the coronavirus outbreak on our FAQs page .   1. Protecting different groups of people  This guidance is for the general public who are fit and well. There is separate, specific guidance on isolation for households with a possible coronavirus infection.  Some people, including those aged 70 and over, those with specific chronic pre-existing conditions and pregnant women, are clinically vulnerable, meaning they are at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. As we begin to ease restrictions, this group who are clinically vulnerable – see section 9 – should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their household.  There is a further group of people who are defined, also on medical grounds, as clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus – that is, people with specific serious health conditions. They are advised to continue shielding to keep themselves safe by staying at home and avoiding gatherings or, if individuals wish to spend time outdoors, to take extra care to minimise contact with others by keeping two metres apart at all times.   2. Meeting family and friends  You should continue to stay alert and limit your contact with others. Staying at home is the easiest way to do this. However, we know that it has been difficult for people to be cut off from their family and friends in recent months.  In England, from 13 June, there will be two ways that you can see people outside of your household. In doing so, it’s important to continue to take the necessary precautions to minimise the risk of spreading infection:   You are already able to meet outdoors in a group of up to six people (including people you don’t live with), whilst observing social distancing guidelines and keeping at least 2 metres apart  From 13 June, single adult households - in other words adults who live alone or with dependent children only - can form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household. All those in a support bubble will be able to spend time together inside each other’s homes, including overnight, without needing to stay 2 metres apart. Individuals may only form a support bubble with one other household. We are making this targeted change to support those who might be feeling lonely or isolated, while ensuring we continue to keep the rate of transmission down   You must not:   Meet other people indoors - including in their home or your home - unless you are in a support bubble (from 13 June), or for other limited circumstances set out in law  If you are part of a support bubble, visit anyone else in another household outside of your support bubble  Meet outdoors in a group of more than six, with people who are not in your household or (where applicable) support bubble  Form a support bubble (from 13 June) with another household if neither you nor they are in a single adult household  Stay overnight in another household that is not in your support bubble (from 13 June and where applicable), unless it is for the limited set of circumstances already outlined in law   The more people you have interactions with, the more chances we give the virus to spread. Therefore, try to limit the number of people you see - especially over short periods of time. Those who are eligible to form a support bubble, should only do so exclusively with one other household.  Further guidance on how to see your friends and family safely can be found here .  When you leave your home, you should follow the guidelines on staying safe outside your home . Most importantly, this includes the key advice that you should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of your household or support bubble (where applicable). Face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if you are in an enclosed space where social distancing is difficult and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. From 15 June face coverings must be worn on public transport, as set out in law.  If you or someone in your household or, from 13 June, your support bubble (if applicable) are showing coronavirus symptoms, everyone in your support bubble should stay home. If you or a member of your support bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme , the individual contacted must stay at home . If the individual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the support bubble must then isolate. This is critical to staying safe and saving lives.  By following this guidance, you are helping to protect yourself, your family, the NHS and your community.  Further guidance on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been issued.   3. Returning to school  The Government has announced the intention to implement a phased return for early years settings and schools, and has provided guidance on the return of children to schools and childcare. Schools are now open for early years (aged 0-5), Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 groups, subject to local arrangements.

https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-will-remove-posts-coronavirus-stay-at-home/,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday said the tech giant is removing posts that look to promote or organize protests against stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19.

Zuckerberg, in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulus on “Good Morning America,” was asked how the company is dealing with Facebook “being used to organize a lot of these protests to defy social distancing guidelines.” Stephanopoulus then asked if this fits Facebook’s “harmful misinformation” designation.

“We do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,” Zuckerberg said. “At the same time, it’s important that people can debate policies so there’s a line on this, you know, more than normal political discourse. I think a lot of the stuff that people are saying that is false around a health emergency like this can be classified as harmful misinformation.”

A Facebook rep later told CNN’s Donnie O’Sullivan the company has removed content promoting anti-quarantine events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska.

Zuckerberg’s comments follow several real world protests in the last week, including in Michigan and Virginia. They also come after President Trump’s coronavirus task force released a three-pronged plan for reopening the economy last week.

At the same time on Monday, Facebook rolled out an interactive map highlighting users reporting COVID-19 symptoms on a county-by-county basis. The map was created in conjunction with data from Carnegie Mellon University, which recently surveyed more than 1 million Facebook users.

“Facebook is uniquely suited to run these surveys because we serve a global community of billions of people and can do statistically accurate sampling,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. “We do this in a privacy protective way where only the researchers at Carnegie Mellon see individual survey responses — and Facebook only sees aggregated data.”

Today we're releasing the first maps of the Covid-19 symptoms people have reported experiencing county-by-county across… Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Monday, April 20, 2020

Facebook last week also shared it will be alerting users who have interacted with “harmful misinformation” on COVID-19 and directing them to updates from the WHO.",

This guidance is for everyone, including children. It advises on social distancing measures we should all be taking to reduce social interaction between people in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). It is intended for use in situations where people are living in their own homes, with or without additional support from friends, family and carers. If you live in a residential care setting guidance is available.

We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.

This group includes those who are:

Note: there are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If you are in this category, next week the NHS in England will directly contact you with advice about the more stringent measures you should take in order to keep yourself and others safe. For now, you should rigorously follow the social distancing advice in full, outlined below.

People falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:

people who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication

people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy

people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment

people with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets)

people with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)

What is social distancing?

Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).

They are to:

Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough Avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible Work from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information Avoid large and small gatherings in public spaces, noting that pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and similar venues are currently shut as infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together. Avoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media Use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services

Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is practicable.

We strongly advise you to follow the above measures as much as you can and to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible, particularly if you:

are over 70

have an underlying health condition

are pregnant

This advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.

Handwashing and respiratory hygiene

There are general principles you can follow to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:

washing your hands more often - with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser when you get home or into work, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, eat or handle food

avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands

avoid close contact with people who have symptoms

cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin and wash your hands

clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home

What should you do if you develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)

The same guidance applies to the general population and those at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19). If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature and/or new and continuous cough), self-isolate at home for 7 days. You can find the full guidance at stay at home.

Ask family, friends and neighbours to support you and use online services. If this is not possible, then the public sector, business, charities, and the general public are gearing up to help those advised to stay at home. It is important to speak to others and ask them to help you to make arrangements for the delivery of food, medicines and essential services and supplies, and look after your physical and mental health and wellbeing.

If you receive support from health and social care organisations, for example, if you have care provided for you through the local authority or health care system, this will continue as normal. Your health or social care provider will be asked to take additional precautions to make sure that you are protected. The advice for formal carers is included in the Home care provision.

What should you do if you have hospital and GP appointments during this period?

We advise everyone to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, if you have a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, talk to your GP or clinician to ensure you continue to receive the care you need and consider whether appointments can be postponed.

What is the advice for visitors including those who are providing care for you?

You should contact your regular social visitors such as friends and family to let them know that you are reducing social contacts and that they should not visit you during this time unless they are providing essential care for you. Essential care includes things like help with washing, dressing or preparing meals.

If you receive regular health or social care from an organisation, either through your local authority or paid for by yourself, inform your care providers that you are reducing social contacts and agree on a plan for continuing your care.

If you receive essential care from friends or family members, speak to your carers about extra precautions they can take to keep you safe. You may find this guidance on Home care provision useful.

It is also a good idea to speak to your carers about what happens if one of them becomes unwell. If you need help with care but you’re not sure who to contact, or if you do not have family or friends who can help you, you can contact your local council who should be able to help you.

What is the advice if I live with a vulnerable person?

If you live in a house with a vulnerable person refer to our household guidance.

Looking after your mental wellbeing

Understandably, you may find that social distancing can be boring or frustrating. You may find your mood and feelings are affected and you may feel low, worried or have problems sleeping and you might miss being outside with other people.

At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse. There are simple things you can do that may help, to stay mentally and physically active during this time such as:

look for ideas of exercises you can do at home on the NHS website

spend time doing things you enjoy – this might include reading, cooking, other indoor hobbies or listening to the radio or watching TV programmes

try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water and try to avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs

keep your windows open to let in fresh air, get some natural sunlight if you can, or get outside into the garden

You can also go for a walk or exercise outdoors if you stay more than 2 metres from others.

It is important to look after your mental health and wellbeing. Further guidance is also available on supporting children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing.

What steps can you take to stay connected with family and friends during this time?

Draw on support you might have through your friends, family and other networks during this time. Try to stay in touch with those around you over the phone, by post, or online. Let people know how you would like to stay in touch and build that into your routine. This is also important in looking after your mental wellbeing and you may find it helpful to talk to them about how you are feeling.

Remember it is OK to share your concerns with others you trust and in doing so you may end up providing support to them too. Or you can use a NHS recommended helpline.

Advice for informal carers

If you are caring for someone who is vulnerable, there are some simple steps that you can take to protect them and to reduce their risk at the current time.

Ensure you follow advice on good hygiene such as:

wash your hands on arrival and often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser

cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze

put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards

do not visit if you are unwell and make alternative arrangements for their care

provide information on who they should call if they feel unwell, how to use NHS 111 online coronavirus service and leave the number for NHS 111 prominently displayed

find out about different sources of support that could be used and access further advice on creating a contingency plan is available from Carers UK

look after your own wellbeing and physical health during this time. Further information is available in our mental health and wellbeing guidance

It advises on social distancing measures we should all be taking to reduce social interaction between people in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). It is intended for use in situations where people are living in their own homes, with or without additional support from friends, family and carers. If you live in a residential care setting guidance is available .  We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.  This group includes those who are:   aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)  under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (ie anyone instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds):  chronic (long-term) mild to moderate respiratory diseases, such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , emphysema or bronchitis   chronic heart disease, such as heart failure   chronic kidney disease  chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis   chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease , motor neurone disease , multiple sclerosis (MS) , a learning disability or cerebral palsy  diabetes  a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS , or medicines such as steroid tablets   being seriously overweight (a body mass index ( BMI ) of 40 or above)    those who are pregnant   Note: there are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If you are in this category, next week the NHS in England will directly contact you with advice about the more stringent measures you should take in order to keep yourself and others safe. For now, you should rigorously follow the social distancing advice in full, outlined below.  People falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:   people who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication  people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy  people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment  people with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets)  people with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)   What is social distancing?  Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).  They are to:   Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough  Avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible  Work from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information  Avoid large and small gatherings in public spaces, noting that pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and similar venues are currently shut as infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together.  Avoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media  Use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services   Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is practicable.  We strongly advise you to follow the above measures as much as you can and to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible, particularly if you:   are over 70  have an underlying health condition  are pregnant   This advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.  Handwashing and respiratory hygiene  There are general principles you can follow to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:   washing your hands more often - with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser when you get home or into work, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, eat or handle food  avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands  avoid close contact with people who have symptoms  cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin and wash your hands  clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home   What should you do if you develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)  The same guidance applies to the general population and those at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19). If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature and/or new and continuous cough), self-isolate at home for 7 days. You can find the full guidance at stay at home .  Getting assistance with foods and medicines if you are reducing social contacts  Ask family, friends and neighbours to support you and use online services. If this is not possible, then the public sector, business, charities, and the general public are gearing up to help those advised to stay at home. It is important to speak to others and ask them to help you to make arrangements for the delivery of food, medicines and essential services and supplies, and look after your physical and mental health and wellbeing.  If you receive support from health and social care organisations, for example, if you have care provided for you through the local authority or health care system, this will continue as normal. Your health or social care provider will be asked to take additional precautions to make sure that you are protected. The advice for formal carers is included in the Home care provision .  What should you do if you have hospital and GP appointments during this period?  We advise everyone to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, if you have a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, talk to your GP or clinician to ensure you continue to receive the care you need and consider whether appointments can be postponed.  What is the advice for visitors including those who are providing care for you?  You should contact your regular social visitors such as friends and family to let them know that you are reducing social contacts and that they should not visit you during this time unless they are providing essential care for you. Essential care includes things like help with washing, dressing or preparing meals.  If you receive regular health or social care from an organisation, either through your local authority or paid for by yourself, inform your care providers that you are reducing social contacts and agree on a plan for continuing your care.  If you receive essential care from friends or family members, speak to your carers about extra precautions they can take to keep you safe. You may find this guidance on Home care provision useful.

https://www.fox13news.com/news/tampa-megachurch-crowded-with-worshipers-despite-social-distancing-orders,"Cheers and applause could be heard on a Tampa megachurch's livestream Sunday from a few hundred people inside The River at Tampa Bay Church. The church is refusing to close its doors despite a ""safer at home"" order in effect in Hillsborough County meant to slow the spread of coronavirus.

""It should make us all uncomfortable,"" said John DeBevoise, a pastor at Palma Ceia Presbyterian Church, located in South Tampa.

DeBevoise was among one of the first churches in the Bay Area to move online.

""People should follow the safer-at-home order as a way of not only caring for themselves, but caring for their neighbors,"" DeBevoise said.

The crowd was an unlikely sight to see and frustrating to many.

""It just seems pretty irresponsible to set up something like that and put all those people at risk,"" said Jeff Anderson, owner of Classic Touch Cleaners.

Anderson said his company had to adjust to new social-distancing guidelines as a business owner.

The River at Tampa Bay Church held regular services Sunday. A spokesperson for the church told FOX 13 over the phone that social distancing guidelines are in place.

A livestream of the service was available online, but the church still allowed hundreds of members to attend in person.

""They are trying to beat me up, you know, over having the church operational. But we are not non-essential,"" Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne is heard saying during The River at Tampa Bay Church services.

FOX 13 reached out to the church Sunday, but they declined our request for an interview.

""We feel that it would be wrong for us to close our doors on them, at this time, or any time. In a time of crisis, people are fearful and in need of comfort and community,"" the church said in statement posted to their website.

Pastor Howard-Browne defended his decision to keep the church open in a video posted to his YouTube channel.

""We brought in 13 machines that basically kill every virus in the place,"" Howard-Browne said. ""If they sneeze it shoots it down like at 100 miles per hour and it will neutralize it in a split second.""

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office says in a statement that they have ""spoken to the leaders at the church regarding their Sunday services that were in direct violation of the President's guidelines for America, recommendations made by the CDC, and orders from the Governor and the Hillsborough County Policy Group.""

A sign by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office was seen placed across the street from The River Church in Tampa recommending social distancing practices.

The sheriff's office has advised the church of the dangers they are putting their congregation in by not maintaining proper social distancing.

As of Sunday night, both attorneys for the church and the sheriff's office are in contact to determine how compliance can be acheived to keep the public safe.

https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/04/public-health-protests-301534,"“The injustice that’s evident to everyone right now needs to be addressed,” Abraar Karan, a Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician who’s exhorted coronavirus experts to amplify the protests' anti-racist message, told me. ""While I have voiced concerns that protests risk creating more outbreaks, the status quo wasn’t going to stop #covid19 either,"" he wrote on Twitter this week.

It’s a message echoed by media outlets and some of the most prominent public health experts in America, like former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden, who loudly warned against efforts to rush reopening but is now supportive of mass protests. Their claim: If we don’t address racial inequality, it’ll be that much harder to fight Covid-19. There’s also evidence that the virus doesn’t spread easily outdoors, especially if people wear masks.

The experts maintain that their messages are consistent—that they were always flexible on Americans going outside, that they want protesters to take precautions and that they're prioritizing public health by demanding an urgent fix to systemic racism.

But their messages are also confounding to many who spent the spring strictly isolated on the advice of health officials, only to hear that the need might not be so absolute after all. It’s particularly nettlesome to conservative skeptics of the all-or-nothing approach to lockdown, who point out that many of those same public health experts—a group that tends to skew liberal—widely criticized activists who held largely outdoor protests against lockdowns in April and May, accusing demonstrators of posing a public health danger. Conservatives, who felt their own concerns about long-term economic damage or even mental health costs of lockdown were brushed aside just days or weeks ago, are increasingly asking whether these public health experts are letting their politics sway their health care recommendations.

“Their rules appear ideologically driven as people can only gather for purposes deemed important by the elite central planners,” Brian Blase, who worked on health policy for the Trump administration, told me, an echo of complaints raised by prominent conservative commentators like J.D. Vance and Tim Carney.

Conservatives also have seized on a Twitter thread by Drew Holden, a commentary writer and former GOP Hill staffer, comparing how politicians and pundits criticized earlier protests but have been silent on the new ones or even championed them.

“I think what’s lost on people is that there have been real sacrifices made during lockdown,” Holden told me. “People who couldn’t bury loved ones. Small businesses destroyed. How can a health expert look those people in the eye and say it was worth it now?”

Some members of the medical community acknowledged they’re grappling with the U-turn in public health advice, too. “It makes it clear that all along there were trade-offs between details of lockdowns and social distancing and other factors that the experts previously discounted and have now decided to reconsider and rebalance,” said Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School. Flier pointed out that the protesters were also engaging in behaviors, like loud singing in close proximity, which CDC has repeatedly suggested could be linked to spreading the virus.

“At least for me, the sudden change in views of the danger of mass gatherings has been disorienting, and I suspect it has been for many Americans,” he told me.

The shift in experts’ tone is setting up a confrontation amid the backdrop of a still-raging pandemic. Tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases continue to be diagnosed every day—and public health experts acknowledge that more will likely come from the mass gatherings, sparked by the protests over George Floyd’s death while in custody of the Minneapolis police last week.

“It is a challenge,” Howard Koh, who served as assistant secretary for health during the Obama administration, told me. Koh said he supports the protests but acknowledges that Covid-19 can be rapidly, silently spread. “We know that a low-risk area today can become a high-risk area tomorrow,” he said.

Yet many say the protests are worth the risk of a possible Covid-19 surge, including hundreds of public health workers who signed an open letter this week that sought to distinguish the new anti-racist protests “from the response to white protesters resisting stay-home orders.”

Those protests against stay-at-home orders “not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives,” according to the letter’s nearly 1,300 signatories. “Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.”

“Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” the letter signers add. “However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.”

Was it fair to decry conservatives’ protests about the economy while supporting these new protests? And if tens of thousands of people get sick from Covid-19 as a result of these mass gatherings against racism, is that an acceptable trade-off? Those are questions that a half-dozen coronavirus experts who said they support the protests declined to directly answer.

“I don’t know if it’s really for me to comment,” said Karan. He did add: “Addressing racism, it can’t wait. It should’ve happened before Covid. It’s happening now. Perhaps this is our time to change things.”

“Many public health experts have already severely undermined the power and influence of their prior message,” countered Flier. “We were exposed to continuous daily Covid death counts, and infections/deaths were presented as preeminent concerns compared to all other considerations—until nine days ago,” he added.

“Overnight, behaviors seen as dangerous and immoral seemingly became permissible due to a ‘greater need,’” Flier said.

The frustration from some conservatives is an outgrowth of how Covid-19 has affected the United States so far. In Blue America, the pandemic is a dire threat that’s killed tens of thousands in densely packed urban centers like New York City—and warnings from infectious-disease experts like Tony Fauci carry the weight of real-world implications. In many parts of Red America, rural states like Alaska and Wyoming still have fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases, and some residents are asking why they shuttered their economies for a virus that had little visible effect over the past three months.

Pollsters also have consistently found a partisan split on how Americans view the pandemic, with Democrats believing that the media is underplaying the risks of Covid-19 while Republicans say that the threat has been exaggerated. That attitude may change with virus numbers on the march in states like Alabama and Arkansas.

People on both sides are already trying to figure out whom to blame if coronavirus cases jump as widely expected after hundreds of thousands of Americans spilled into the streets this past week, sometimes in close proximity for hours at a time. When we discussed the possible risks of a large public gathering, protest supporters like Karan and Koh seized on police behaviors —like using pepper spray and locking up protesters in jail cells—which they noted created significant risks of their own to spread Covid-19.

“Trump will try to blame protestors for [the] spike in coronavirus cases he caused,” a spokesperson for Protect Our Care, a progressive-aligned health care group, wrote in a memo circulated to media members on Wednesday. While acknowledging the risks of mass protests, “the reality is that the spikes in cases have been happening well before the protests started—in large part because Trump allowed federal social distancing guidelines to expire, failed to adequately increase testing, and pushed governors to reopen against the advice of medical experts,” the spokesperson claimed.","       Skip to Main Content              POLITICO               Magazine   The Agenda   Pro    Search     Search                 SECTIONS    The Agenda   Magazine   Congress   White House   Video   Podcasts      2020 Elections    News   Election Results   Delegate Tracker   Forecast   Endorsements   Issues   Polls   Money      NEWSLETTERS    Playbook   Playbook PM   POLITICO Nightly: Coronavirus Special Edition   Huddle   All Newsletters     SERIES    The Deciders   What Works   Women Rule      POLITICO LIVE    Live Home   Upcoming Events   Previous Events   About POLITICO Live     COLUMNS & CARTOONS    Rich Lowry   Jack Shafer   Matt Wuerker   Cartoon Carousel      POLICY    Agriculture   Cannabis   Cybersecurity   Defense   Education   eHealth   Employment & Immigration   Energy & Environment   Finance & Tax   Health Care   Space   Sustainability   Technology   Trade   Transportation      EDITIONS    California   Canada   China   Europe   Florida   New Jersey   New York   Pro      Follow us    Twitter   Instagram   Facebook       My Account   Log In Log Out                        Magazine          Coronavirus   Suddenly, Public Health Officials Say Social Justice Matters More Than Social Distance  For months, health experts told Americans to stay home. Now, many are encouraging the public to join mass protests.

He also co-authors the POLITICO Pulse newsletter and hosts the Pulse Check podcast.    For months, public health experts have urged Americans to take every precaution to stop the spread of Covid-19—stay at home, steer clear of friends and extended family, and absolutely avoid large gatherings.  Now some of those experts are broadcasting a new message: It’s time to get out of the house and join the mass protests against racism.   Advertisement       “We should always evaluate the risks and benefits of efforts to control the virus,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, tweeted on Tuesday. “In this moment the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.”                      “The injustice that’s evident to everyone right now needs to be addressed,” Abraar Karan, a Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician who’s exhorted coronavirus experts to amplify the protests' anti-racist message, told me. ""While I have voiced concerns that protests risk creating more outbreaks, the status quo wasn’t going to stop #covid19 either,"" he wrote on Twitter this week.  It’s a message echoed by media  outlets and some of the most prominent public health experts in America, like former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden, who loudly warned against efforts to rush reopening but is now supportive of mass protests. Their claim: If we don’t address racial inequality, it’ll be that much harder to fight Covid-19. There’s also evidence that the virus doesn’t spread easily outdoors, especially if people wear masks.  The experts maintain that their messages are consistent—that they were always flexible on Americans going outside, that they want protesters to take precautions and that they're prioritizing public health by demanding an urgent fix to systemic racism.  But their messages are also confounding to many who spent the spring strictly isolated on the advice of health officials, only to hear that the need might not be so absolute after all. It’s particularly nettlesome to conservative skeptics of the all-or-nothing approach to lockdown, who  point out that many of those same public health experts —a group that tends to skew liberal— widely criticized activists who held largely outdoor protests against lockdowns in April and May, accusing demonstrators of posing a public health danger. Conservatives, who felt their own concerns about long-term economic damage or even mental health costs of lockdown were brushed aside just days or weeks ago, are increasingly asking whether these public health experts are letting their politics sway their health care recommendations.  “Their rules appear ideologically driven as people can only gather for purposes deemed important by the elite central planners,” Brian Blase, who worked on health policy for the Trump administration, told me, an echo of complaints raised by prominent conservative commentators like J.D. Vance and Tim Carney .   Conservatives also have seized on a Twitter thread by Drew Holden, a commentary writer and former GOP Hill staffer, comparing how politicians and pundits criticized earlier protests but have been silent on the new ones or even championed them.  “I think what’s lost on people is that there have been real sacrifices made during lockdown,” Holden told me. “People who couldn’t bury loved ones. Small businesses destroyed. How can a health expert look those people in the eye and say it was worth it now?”  Some members of the medical community acknowledged they’re grappling with the U-turn in public health advice, too. “It makes it clear that all along there were trade-offs between details of lockdowns and social distancing and other factors that the experts previously discounted and have now decided to reconsider and rebalance,” said Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School. Flier pointed out that the protesters were also engaging in behaviors, like loud singing in close proximity, which CDC has repeatedly suggested could be linked to spreading the virus.  “At least for me, the sudden change in views of the danger of mass gatherings has been disorienting, and I suspect it has been for many Americans,” he told me.  The shift in experts’ tone is setting up a confrontation amid the backdrop of a still-raging pandemic. Tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases continue to be diagnosed every day—and public health experts acknowledge that more will likely come from the mass gatherings, sparked by the protests over George Floyd’s death while in custody of the Minneapolis police last week.  “It is a challenge,” Howard Koh, who served as assistant secretary for health during the Obama administration, told me. Koh said he supports the protests but acknowledges that Covid-19 can be rapidly, silently spread. “We know that a low-risk area today can become a high-risk area tomorrow,” he said.  Yet many say the protests are worth the risk of a possible Covid-19 surge, including hundreds of public health workers who signed an open letter this week that sought to distinguish the new anti-racist protests “from the response to white protesters resisting stay-home orders.”  Those protests against stay-at-home orders “not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives,” according to the letter’s nearly 1,300 signatories. “Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.”  “Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” the letter signers add. “However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.”  Was it fair to decry conservatives’ protests about the economy while supporting these new protests? And if tens of thousands of people get sick from Covid-19 as a result of these mass gatherings against racism, is that an acceptable trade-off? Those are questions that a half-dozen coronavirus experts who said they support the protests declined to directly answer.  “I don’t know if it’s really for me to comment,” said Karan.  He did add: “Addressing racism, it can’t wait. It should’ve happened before Covid. It’s happening now. Perhaps this is our time to change things.”  “Many public health experts have already severely undermined the power and influence of their prior message,” countered Flier. “We were exposed to continuous daily Covid death counts, and infections/deaths were presented as preeminent concerns compared to all other considerations—until nine days ago,” he added.  “Overnight, behaviors seen as dangerous and immoral seemingly became permissible due to a ‘greater need,’” Flier said.  The frustration from some conservatives is an outgrowth of how Covid-19 has affected the United States so far. In Blue America, the pandemic is a dire threat that’s killed tens of thousands in densely packed urban centers like New York City—and warnings from infectious-disease experts like Tony Fauci carry the weight of real-world implications. In many parts of  Red America, rural states like Alaska and Wyoming still have fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases, and some residents are asking why they shuttered their economies for a virus that had little visible effect over the past three months.  Pollsters also have consistently found a partisan split on how Americans view the pandemic, with Democrats believing that the media is underplaying the risks of Covid-19 while Republicans say that the threat has been exaggerated. That attitude may change with virus numbers on the march in states like Alabama and Arkansas.  People on both sides are already trying to figure out whom to blame if coronavirus cases jump as widely expected after hundreds of thousands of Americans spilled into the streets this past week, sometimes in close proximity for hours at a time.

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW  The unemployment rate fell to a crisis low, but the reality of the job market is now likely far bleaker.

A conservative lawmaker is demanding the coronavirus task force disband.  California’s anti-vaccine movement has a new target: masks.   How America botched its reopening and walked straight into an ""I told you so"" moment.    Read all coronavirus coverage »                Contra those claims, public health experts like Koh generally acknowledge that it’s going to be difficult to tease apart why Covid-19 cases could jump in the coming weeks, given the sheer number of Americans joining mass gatherings, states relaxing restrictions and other factors that could pose challenges for disease-tracing on a large scale.  Some experts also are cautious of condemning states for rolling back restrictions after inconclusive evidence from states that already moved to do so. For instance, a widely shared Atlantic article in April framed the decision by Georgia’s GOP governor to relax social-distancing restrictions as an “experiment in human sacrifice.” A month later, Georgia’s daily coronavirus cases have stayed relatively level and it’s not clear whether the rollback led to significant new outbreaks.  What is clear is that the only successful tactic to stop Covid-19 remains social distancing and, failing that, thoroughly wearing personal protective equipment. Yet there’s also considerable video and photo evidence of maskless protesters, sometimes closely huddled together with public officials—also sans mask—in efforts to defuse tensions, or recoiling from police attacks that forced them to remove protection.  That means a collision between the protests and coronavirus is coming, which will force decisions big and small. Will local leaders need to reimpose restrictions when cases go up? Will that advice be trusted? Or is it possible that their guidance was too draconian all along?  Some participants in the new protests—whether marching themselves or drawn in from the sidelines—say they recognize the threat they’re facing.  A Washington, D.C., man named Rahul Dubey attracted national attention for sheltering protesters from the police inside his home on Monday night. On Wednesday, he told me that he was on the way to get a coronavirus test and was planning to self-quarantine himself for two weeks—having spent hours in close proximity to dozens of maskless people.  It’s a reminder of a line often heard from medical experts: Public health should be above politics. Now some conservatives are invoking it too.  “The virus doesn’t care about the nature of a protest, no matter how deserving the cause is,” Holden said.

https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,"Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns.

Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.

However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person outdoor protests as long as you maintain a physical distance of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. When you can’t maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from people not in your household, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.

State public health directives do not prohibit in-person indoor protests as long as (1) attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2) physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.

Participants must maintain a physical distance of 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.

This limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.","    Skip to main content         COVID19.CA.GOV                    Search     Select language   Español  Tagalog  العربية  한국어  Tiếng Việt  中文  文言  More…           Menu     Home   Get help  Financial help Food and food assistance Workers Businesses and employers Immigrant communities Housing and homelessness Emotional support Manage your stress Childcare   Health information  Symptoms and risks Testing sites Contact tracing Telehealth Health care Masks COVID-19 Hotline   Working and living safely  What's open Stay home Q&A County variance and map Reopening roadmap Industry guidance Local info and alerts Education Senior living Public recreation Contracts Taxes Hotels for health workers   How you can help  Fighting discrimination Plasma donation Resilience roadmap survey California Health Corps Great Plates provider form Social media sharing More ways to help            Stay home Q&A  Last updated
                  
                    July 1, 2020 at 5:52 PM         All individuals living in the State of California are currently ordered to stay home or at their place of residence, except for permitted work , local shopping or other permitted errands, or as otherwise authorized (including in the Questions & Answers below).  On March 19, 2020, an Executive Order (PDF) and Public Health Order (PDF) directed all Californians to stay home except to go to an essential job or to shop for essential needs.  On May 4, 2020, an Executive Order (PDF) informed local health jurisdictions and industry sectors that they may gradually reopen under new modifications and guidance provided by the state per the May 7, 2020 Public Health Order (PDF) .  See essential jobs and open sectors  Questions and answers     What is the relationship between the order and these questions and answers?     The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.      When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?     The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California. As of May 8, the stay home order was modified. In addition to essential activity,  retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open. Six key health and scientific indicators will be considered before modifying the state’s stay home order to allow additional activity under the Resilience Roadmap .      What’s open statewide?     Essential services that protect public health, public safety, and provide essential needs will remain open, such as: Gas stations Pharmacies Food: Grocery stores, farmers markets, food banks, convenience stores, take-out and delivery restaurants Banks Laundromats/laundry services Childcare Essential state and local government functions will also remain open, including law enforcement and offices that provide government programs and services. Retailers can open statewide. All will require modifications to support social distancing. This includes: Shopping malls Libraries Movie theaters and drive-in theaters (with modifications) Bookstores Jewelry stores Toy stores Clothing and shoe stores Home and furnishing stores Sporting goods stores Florists Offices (in all sectors, not only critical infrastructure) Limited services which do not generally require close customer contact, such as: Pet grooming Dog walking Car washes Appliance repair Residential and janitorial cleaning Places of worship Plumbing Outdoor museums Music, film, and TV production Professional sports (without live audiences) Schools and day camps      What’s closed statewide?     Statewide, the following are still closed: Personal services, like nail salons, body waxing and tattoo parlors Public events and gatherings, like live audience sports Convention centers Theme parks and festivals Higher education (in person), except where supporting essential workforce activities , including but not limited to providing housing solutions, COVID-19 response, and training and instruction for the essential workforce. Indoor playgrounds, like bounce centers, ball pits and laser tag Saunas and steam rooms Recreational team sports      What is open with county variance?     The following may open only in counties approved to move further in the Resilience Roadmap : Dine-in restaurants Hair salons and barber shops Casinos Counties that are approved to progress further into the Resilience Roadmap can decide to open the following industries but are strongly encouraged to wait until June 12, 2020: Family entertainment centers Restaurants, wineries and bars Zoos and museums Gyms and fitness centers Hotels (for tourism and individual travel) Cardrooms and racetracks Campgrounds and outdoor recreation Counties that are approved to progress further into the Resilience Roadmap can decide to open the following industries but are strongly encouraged to wait until June 19, 2020: Personal services, like nail salons, body waxing and tattoo parlors      Is it safe to shop at open businesses?     The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these state guidelines .      Can the Order be changed?     Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.      How does this order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?     This is a statewide order. Counties may move further into the Resilience Roadmap if they meet certain criteria.      If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?     Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under Health care ). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.      Are gatherings permitted?     State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community gatherings. Gatherings are defined as meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19. On May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. State public health directives now do not prohibit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. All other gatherings are prohibited until further notice, except as otherwise specifically permitted in state public health directives (including in applicable industry guidance). Crowds and limited physical distancing increase the risk for COVID-19. If you attended a protest, remember that confidential, free testing is available. Find a testing location near you . If you test negative it does not mean that you may not develop COVID-19 later on. Therefore, it is advisable that you self-isolate for 14 days if possible.      Can I get a haircut?     It depends. If your county has been approved to move further in the Resilience Roadmap, then hair salons and barber shops may reopen in your area. See the list of counties with a variance .   Protected activities     I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?     There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views. Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign. If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.  The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.  Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives. Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws. If you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.      Can I engage in political protest gatherings?     Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.

Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended. State public health directives do not prohibit in-person indoor protests as long as (1) attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2) physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.

This limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.      How do I vote?     Elections are an essential activity, and the Governor has issued executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible . Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Additionally, many in-person voting opportunities will be available: counties are required to provide three days of early voting starting the Saturday before the election, and open ballot drop-box locations between October 6 and November 3, 2020. The Secretary of State and the California Department of Public Health are working on additional guidance to ensure that all Californians are able to participate in elections safely. Except where suspended by Executive Order, existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect. Of course, whenever you engage in any permissible activity—including the collection and drop-off of ballots, or other election-related activities (such as the collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot)—adhere to physical distancing and other applicable public health directives.      Can I go to church for worship or a funeral?     Yes. As of May 25, places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with modifications for safety (PDF) .      Can I practice my religious faith?     Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms. Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.      What conditions must be met to resume religious services at places of worship?     Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at guidance for places of worship (PDF) . Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19. Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, congregants engaging in singing, particularly in the choir, and group recitation should wear face coverings at all times. Places of worship must therefore limit indoor attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. This limitation will be in effect for the first 21 days of a county public health department’s approval of religious services and cultural ceremonies activities at places of worship within their jurisdictions.      Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?     At this time, no. Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at all times while visiting facilities. Places of worship must discontinue activities and services for children (for example, shared play areas) where physical distancing of at least 6 feet cannot be maintained.      When will these conditions change for places of worship?     Every 21 days, the California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. This is because COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days; the 21-day interval accounts for this incubation period and provides for an additional seven days for thorough review, analysis, and preparation of modifications.   Outdoor recreation     Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block?     It’s okay to go outside to go for a walk, to exercise, and participate in healthy activities as long as you maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet and gather only with members of your household. You can also participate in activities at outdoor recreational facilities that are allowed to open. Parks may be closed to help slow the spread of the virus. Check with local officials about park closures in your area. Californians should not travel significant distances for recreation and should stay close to home. Below is a list of some outdoor recreational activities. Badminton (singles) Throwing a baseball/softball BMX biking Canoeing (singles) Crabbing Cycling Exploring rock pools Gardening (not in groups) Golfing (doubles, only if cart has protective partition) Hiking (trails/ paths allowing distancing) Horse riding (singles) Jogging and running Kite boarding and kitesurfing Meditation Outdoor photography Picnics (with your household members only) Quad biking Rock climbing Roller skating and rollerblading Rowing (singles) Scootering (not in groups) Skateboarding (not in groups) Soft martial arts – tai chi, chi kung (not in groups) Surfing Tennis and table tennis (singles) Throwing a football, kicking a soccer ball (not in groups) Trail running Trampolining Tree climbing Volleyball (singles) Walk the dog Wash the car Watch the sunrise or sunset Yoga      Can I walk my dog? Take my pet to the vet?     You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to wear a face covering and distance yourself at least 6 feet from other pets and owners.      Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?     State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers may continue to be closed to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check parks in your area before you travel . Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently. You can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails and parking lots. For information on National Parks, please the National Park Service website .      Can I travel?     You can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks. Do not travel with someone who is sick. Before travelling away from your community, consider these questions from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) travel guidance : Is coronavirus spreading where you are traveling? Are you or those you are traveling with more likely to get very sick from coronavirus? Will you be able to keep 6 feet of physical distance from others during or after your trip? If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.   Government services     Can I go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)?     Beginning June 11, all DMV offices are open to the public to help with appointments that require an in-person visit. You will be required to wear a mask and must remain 6 feet apart in line. In-person appointments are limited to: Paying registration for a vehicle impounded because of registration-related issues Reinstating a suspended or revoked driver license Applying for a reduced-fee or no-fee identification card Processing commercial driver license transactions Applying for a disabled person parking placards Adding an ambulance certificate or firefighter endorsement to a driver license Verifying a transit training document to drive a transit bus Processing DMV Express customers for REAL ID transactions, if time and space allows On June 26, the DMV will begin behind-the-wheel driving tests. The DMV will reschedule all cancelled driving test appointments. New behind-the-wheel driving tests will not be available until all cancelled appointments are completed. For the health and safety of drivers and DMV staff , you must wear a face covering and will have your temperature checked before the test. DMV services that do not require an in-person office visit can be accessed through the DMV Virtual Field Office , including driver’s license renewals, vehicle registrations, title changes, and more. DMV has extended deadlines for: All drivers licenses expiring between March 1 through July 31, 2020 Drivers 70 years of age and older will receive a 120-day paper extension. Drivers 69 years of age and younger can request a free temporary extension online , though one is not needed to drive. Expiring commercial licenses, endorsements, and certificates are valid through June 30, 2020. In-person renewals for vehicle registrations that expire between the dates of March 16, 2020, and May 31, 2020. In-person renewals for those with safe driving records whose last DMV visit was 15 years ago. Driver license permits expiring between June through August 2020 are extended six months or to a date 24 months from the date of application, whichever is earlier. Commercial learner’s permits expiring between March and June 2020 are now valid through June 30, 2020.      Can I get my car smog checked?     It depends. Some smog check locations may be closed. The Bureau of Automotive Repair advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, you can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.

https://medium.com/@ariadnelabs/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day-ac21d7fa78b4,"Our health system will not be able to cope with the projected numbers of people who will need acute care should we not muster the fortitude and will to socially distance each other starting now. On a regular day, we have about 45,000 staffed ICU beds nationally, which can be ramped up in a crisis to about 95,000. Even moderate projections suggest that if current infectious trends hold, our capacity (locally and nationally) may be overwhelmed as early as mid-late April. Thus, the only strategies that can get us off this concerning trajectory are those that enable us to work together as a community to maintain public health by staying apart.

The wisdom, and necessity, of this more aggressive, early, and extreme form of social distancing can be found here. I would urge you to take a minute to walk through the interactive graphs — they will drive home the point about what we need to do now to avoid a worse crisis later. Historical lessons and experiences of countries worldwide have shown us that taking these actions early can have a dramatic impact on the magnitude of the outbreak. So what does this enhanced form of social distancing mean on a daily basis, when schools are cancelled?

Here are some steps you can start taking now to keep your family safe and do your part to avoid a worsening crisis:

1. We need to push our local, state, and national leaders to close ALL schools and public spaces and cancel all events and public gatherings now.

A local, town by town response won’t have the adequate needed effect. We need a statewide, nationwide approach in these trying times. Contact your representative and your governor to urge them to enact statewide closures. As of today, six states have already done so. Your state should be one of them. Also urge leaders to increase funds for emergency preparedness and make widening coronavirus testing capacity an immediate and top priority. We also need legislators to enact better paid sick leave and unemployment benefits to help nudge people to make the right call to stay at home right now.

2. No kid playdates, parties, sleepovers, or families/friends visiting each other’s houses and apartments.

This sounds extreme because it is. We are trying to create distance between family units and between individuals. It may be particularly uncomfortable for families with small children, kids with differential abilities or challenges, and for kids who simply love to play with their friends. But even if you choose only one friend to have over, you are creating new links and possibilities for the type of transmission that all of our school/work/public event closures are trying to prevent. The symptoms of coronavirus take four to five days to manifest themselves. Someone who comes over looking well can transmit the virus. Sharing food is particularly risky — I definitely do not recommend that people do so outside of their family.

We have already taken extreme social measures to address this serious disease — let’s not actively co-opt our efforts by having high levels of social interaction at people’s houses instead of at schools or workplaces. Again — the wisdom of early and aggressive social distancing is that it can flatten the curve above, give our health system a chance to not be overwhelmed, and eventually may reduce the length and need for longer periods of extreme social distancing later (see what has transpired in Italy and Wuhan). We need to all do our part during these times, even if it means some discomfort for a while.

3. Take care of yourself and your family, but maintain social distance.

Exercise, take walks/runs outside, and stay connected through phone, video, and other social media. But when you go outside, do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members. If you have kids, try not to use public facilities like playground structures, as coronavirus can live on plastic and metal for two to three days, and these structures aren’t getting regularly cleaned.

Going outside will be important during these strange times, and the weather is improving. Go outside every day if you are able, but stay physically away from people outside your family or roommates. If you have kids, try playing a family soccer game instead of having your kids play with other kids, since sports often mean direct physical contact with others. And though we may wish to visit elders in our community in person, I would not visit nursing homes or other areas where large numbers of the elderly reside, as they are at highest risk for complications and mortality from coronavirus.

Social distancing can take a toll (after all, most of us are social creatures). The CDC offers tips and resources to reduce this burden, and other resources offer strategies to cope with the added stress during this time.

We need to find alternate ways to reduce social isolation within our communities through virtual means instead of in-person visits.

4. Reduce the frequency of going to stores, restaurants, and coffee shops for the time being.

Of course trips to the grocery store will be necessary, but try to limit them and go at times when they are less busy. Consider asking grocery stores to queue people at the door in order to limit the number of people inside a store at any one time. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly before and after your trip. And leave the medical masks and gloves for the medical professionals — we need them to care for those who are sick. Maintain distance from others while shopping — and remember that hoarding supplies negatively impacts others so buy what you need and leave some for everyone else. Take-out meals and food are riskier than making food at home given the links between the people who prepare food, transport the food, and you. It is hard to know how much that risk is, but it is certainly higher than making it at home. But you can and should continue to support your local small businesses (especially restaurants and other retailers) during this difficult time by buying gift certificates online that you can use later.

5. If you are sick, isolate yourself, stay home, and contact a medical professional.

If you are sick, you should try to isolate yourself from the rest of your family within your residence as best as you can. If you have questions about whether you qualify or should get a coronavirus test, you can call your primary care team and/or consider calling the Massachusetts Department of Public Health at 617.983.6800 (or your state’s department of health if you are outside of Massachusetts). Don’t just walk into an ambulatory clinic — call first so that they can give you the best advice — which might be to go to a drive-through testing center or a virtual visit on video or phone. Of course, if it is an emergency call 911.",
https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/,"Watson: If you don’t have symptoms, going out in nature where you are not within six feet of other people is okay. We need to look after our mental and physical health, and fresh air, nature, and exercise are really important for that. However, meeting people is risky and could undermine our collective sacrifice to reduce viral transmission, especially if you don’t keep your distance. If you do go out with a friend, stay at least six feet away and avoid physical contact.

Read: Here’s who should be avoiding crowds right now

Should I be worried about going to the grocery store?



Cannuscio: I would say try to shop at times when there are very few other shoppers there. That [could mean] going first thing in the morning when the store opens, or late at night. I think many people will rely on delivery, and that’s just the nature of our lives right now. For delivery workers, I would say, leave the food on the doorstep and ring the bell, rather than interacting face-to-face with the person who’s ordered the food.

Should I take public transportation?



Cannuscio: First of all, people who have the opportunity or the option of working at home should absolutely use that option right now. For people who have essential functions and have to be at work, if they have any flexibility in their schedules they should try to ride at non-peak hours. On subways or buses, people should try to stand as far away from other people as possible. I think it’s important for planners to think about, for example, putting more buses on the most heavily traveled routes, to maybe thin out the crowds on those buses. In cities where it’s possible to walk, that would be a better option.

For people who can afford to use ride-sharing services, you’re limiting the number of people you’re in contact with as the rider, so to me that seems like a reasonable step to take. Of course, I worry about all those drivers who have people in and out of their cars all day long.

And of course, everyone should be using good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. If you have to cough, cough into your elbow. And I can’t believe I have to say this, but I’ve been in public places where people have been spitting, in parks or on the sidewalk. I would ask people not to spit!

Watson: It’s hard to say “Don’t take public transit,” because a lot of people rely on it to get to work. If you don’t have to and you can drive, it’s probably a good idea. It will help other people who have to take public transit for their livelihoods to do so and do so more safely.

Should my family be canceling events like birthday parties AND weddings?



As of March 15, the CDC recommends that all gatherings involving 50 people or more be canceled for at least the next eight weeks.

Cannuscio: One of the best ways we can show love to the people we care about is to step back and to stay away. In many cases that takes courage, and it takes speaking out over these social norms that dictate that we should be polite and we should be together and we should celebrate and gather.

Should I stop visiting elderly relatives?



Watson: I think we should start limiting visitation to people who are in assisted-living facilities and nursing homes. I know that’s really tough, and maybe setting things up so you can visit them virtually is a good idea. [That way], they can see you and say hello, [without putting] them at extra risk.","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe      Family   The Dos and Don’ts of ‘Social Distancing’   Experts weigh in on whether you should cancel your dates, dinner parties, and gym sessions.  Kaitlyn Tiffany   March 12, 2020     Valeria Ferraro / Echoes Wire / Barcroft Media via Getty     Link Copied     Editor’s Note: Information about the novel coronavirus is rapidly changing. As a result, some of the information or advice in this article may be out-of-date. You can find The Atlantic ’s most current COVID-19 coverage here .  Updated at 11:20 a.m. ET on March 19, 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for “community mitigation strategies” to limit the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which include recommendations for “social distancing”—a term that epidemiologists are using to refer to a conscious effort to reduce close contact between people and hopefully stymie community transmission of the virus. But what exactly does “social distancing” look like for a woman trying to go about her life while staying healthy and helping keep the people around her healthy? Even detailed instructions are difficult to sift for actionable advice. If I have a fourth date tonight, do I go? If I’m invited to a wedding in two weeks in another state, is it too late to cancel? If we’re on lockdown, and I live alone, can I walk to my friend’s apartment when I feel sad? If I end up officially quarantined, can I walk around the park at night for some fresh air? The CDC guidelines acknowledge factors like the size of a community, its population density, its access to health care, and caveats that social-distancing measures can “be scaled up or down depending on the evolving local situation.” There are conflicting messages coming from media and people’s peers: On Reddit, young people are signing a “self-quarantine manifesto” while, at a press conference , the mayor of New York City is telling people to continue visiting bars and restaurants as normal, to protect the local economy.        Read: Cancel everything So I took my personal questions to a series of public-health experts. “I think it’s a hard time because many of the recommendations we’re making are about increasing the distance between people, but of course, being close to people is what makes life a pleasure,” Carolyn Cannuscio, the director of research at the Center for Public Health Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania said in a phone call. “So this is going to be a very difficult time. No question.” If you’re confused about what to do right now, you’re not alone—even these experts occasionally disagreed on the answers to my questions. Where there were discrepancies, I’ve included all the different answers as fully as possible, and as the situation has evolved, I’ve allowed the experts to update their answers to questions to reflect new information. This guide is aimed toward those who are symptom-free and not part of an at-risk group, with an addendum at the end for those in quarantine. If you are symptom-free but are over 60 years old ; have asthma, heart disease, or diabetes; or are otherwise at risk, experts recommend defaulting to the most conservative response to each of these questions. There is a general consensus that while young and healthy people who are at lower risk for personally suffering severe illness from the coronavirus don’t have to be locking themselves in their homes for the next month, they do need to dramatically alter their daily lives, starting now. If I’m Symptom-Free: Should I be avoiding bars and restaurants?  As of March 16 , in some areas, restaurants and bars have been ordered to close for everything but takeout and delivery.  Cannuscio : People should avoid gathering in public places. People should be at home as much as possible. The measures that have worked to get transmission under control or at least to bend the curve, in China and South Korea, have been extreme measures to increase social distancing. Albert Ko, the chair of the epidemiology department at the Yale School of Public Health : The CDC recommendations are to keep six to 10 feet away from other people. Bottom line, there’s no absolute indication not to go to bars and restaurants, but in practicing good public health—which is kind of a responsibility for everybody in the country—really think about how we can decrease those close contacts. Can I have a small group of friends over to my house for a dinner party or a board-game night? Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: With few exceptions, now is the time to cancel get-togethers. Dating, family visits, house parties, should all be postponed or held virtually if possible. There are personal situations where you must go out for work, for supplies, or to help someone else in need. In those cases, take precautions to keep your distance from others, and wash your hands frequently. If you develop a fever or cough, don’t go out unless it is absolutely necessary or to seek medical care.        Ko : We’re in a gray zone now. The public-health imperative is to create social distance; that’s the only way we’re going to stop this. Think about having those get-togethers but practicing good public health: not sitting very close, trying to keep distance. Wash your hands; avoid touching your face. There are places on the board game that people are constantly touching—routinely disinfect [those, as well as] doorknobs, the bathroom faucets, those types of things. There’s no absolute rule about what works, but what we do know is that decreasing the size of those gatherings, increasing the distance, practicing good hygiene will go a long way. Cannuscio: I would recommend that people minimize social contact, and that means limiting all social engagements. That includes intimate gatherings among friends. I think the exception is if two households are in strict agreement that they are also going to reduce all outside contact and then those two households socialize together, to support one another. I can see social and mental-health advantages to that kind of approach. Should I stop dating? Ko: Dating is usually one person and another person. What we’re really worried about in terms of public health are these large gatherings where you have people crowded together, and you can have what we call super-spreading events. The risk of those goes up exponentially the larger the size of the gathering. Dating is at the other end. I think you can still date. Cannuscio: It is a time to be very cautious about initiating contact with new people. This seems like a great time to get creative with your text messages. [Or] take it to FaceTime or a phone call. Can I go to the gym? Watson:  I would not advise people to go to the gym to work out now. I am trending more toward being conservative with social-distancing measures the more we see from Italy and with the changes in guidance from CDC and state and local health authorities. So, I would not advise people to go to the gym to work out now. Cannuscio: No. In the coming days, as the crisis escalates, our freedom of movement may be restricted, so people will have to get creative about exercising at home. Can someone please host virtual dance parties? Create a playlist to get us through the pandemic? Our family has felt some relief after blasting music and dancing around the kitchen—not to deny the horror of what is happening now, but to deal with it. Our daughter actually thanked us when we threw a dance party. Highly recommend. Can I go For a walk outside with a friend, as long as we stay six feet apart and neither of us feels sick? Cannuscio: For now, walking, running, [and] biking outside, in uncrowded locations, seems like a healthy thing to do. Our family has driven to the woods in the past few days, in search of green and open space. For urban dwellers, finding an empty path is challenging. For people in more remote areas, being outside is a great way to cope. Walking outside with a friend, while keeping distance, is likely to be a relatively low-risk activity. With every additional social contact, the risk of encountering an infected person goes up, so strictly minimize the number of people you interact with. I wouldn’t pick a new friend every day! Stick with one friend, and preferably one who limits their other social contacts, too.        Watson: If you don’t have symptoms, going out in nature where you are not within six feet of other people is okay. We need to look after our mental and physical health, and fresh air, nature, and exercise are really important for that. However, meeting people is risky and could undermine our collective sacrifice to reduce viral transmission, especially if you don’t keep your distance.

I know that’s really tough, and maybe setting things up so you can visit them virtually is a good idea. [That way], they can see you and say hello, [without putting] them at extra risk.        Cannuscio : I think if we are fortunate enough to live near our elders and we get into the mode of seriously isolating our own families, then one person should be designated to go and visit. If we’re not in a situation where we can truly limit our own social contact, then we will be putting that elder at risk by going to visit. Should I be canceling haircuts and other nonessential appointments? Watson : Those are more one-on-one interactions. I think there’s a lower likelihood that exposure is going to occur that way. I don’t think that’s a big concern. Cannuscio : I would say hold off on your haircut and then when you go back, when it’s clear that we have vanquished this foe, everybody please give your hairdresser extra, extra tips. I hope that policies will be put into place to protect the paychecks of people who will suffer during this period. Should I avoid communal spaces in my apartment building? Cannuscio : Try to schedule your use of those common spaces so you’re going at times when other people aren’t around. If you know there are not a lot of people in the laundry room or mailroom at 6 a.m., go at 6 a.m. People will be inconvenienced, but it’s important to try to spread ourselves out. Should I limit physical interaction with my partner, or other people I live with? Ko : That’s really hard to do. Again, what we’re really worried about is large gatherings. In the home, close contact is almost inevitable. Cannuscio : I would say if you’re in a steady, monogamous relationship and you and that other person are limiting your social contacts, then be as intimate as you want to be. Watson : If you get sick, try to maintain some distance. Otherwise, households should go about their normal business. Can I take my kids to a playground? Watson: This is a tough call. I will only be taking my son when it is not busy and I can keep him six feet away from other kids. If I walk to the park with him and see many other kids playing, I turn around and go home or just continue on with our walk. The outdoors is not an ideal condition for survival of the coronavirus, and it will likely not survive long on playground equipment due to a combination of factors such as precipitation and UV light from the sun. However, to be extra cautious, it may be better to avoid the equipment and play catch, or some other outdoor game instead. Cannuscio : Certainly, there is no chance I would recommend an indoor shared playroom, playground, or play space. For my own children, even the outdoor playground is off-limits, and I would suggest the same to others. One goal is to keep people (including children) away from one another—and children congregate at playgrounds. A second goal is to avoid contaminated surfaces, like play equipment. It’s impractical to suggest that people could use the playground while avoiding people and disinfecting the play surfaces. For now, find the widest open space available to you and your family, and go there.        If I Get Symptoms or Am Exposed to Someone Who’s Sick: If I am waiting out a 14-day quarantine, can I have visitors as long as they stand far away from me? Cannuscio : No, quarantine means “stay away from other people.” You shouldn’t have visitors. Ko : Under quarantine, people really shouldn’t enter the home or be in the same physical space. Read: What will you do if you start coughing? Can I walk around outside at all when I’m under quarantine? Cannuscio : For people who live in areas that are not densely populated, walking around in their yard is probably safe. The idea is that they should not come into contact with any other people. They need to be strict about it. We are not going to defeat this and halt transmission if people loosely interpret what it means to self-quarantine or self-isolate.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there is no tolerance for those flouting orders to socially distance from others in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.

“You all think you’re invincible. You’re not. Enough is enough,” he warned in an address to Canadians on Monday from Rideau Cottage, where he is currently in self-isolation.

“Go home and stay home.”

Trudeau’s warning comes as provinces and territories over the weekend threatened to roll out fines and potentially even criminal enforcement measures like arrests in order to enforce social distancing.

There were reports from across the country over the weekend of people flouting those orders by congregating in parks, beaches and other public areas despite warnings from public health officials that isolating from other people is a critical means of trying to limit the spread of the virus.

Trudeau said he will be speaking with premiers from across the country on Monday evening to discuss how they can co-ordinate to crack down on those ignoring social distancing.

“There is more that can be done, there is more that needs to be done around messaging,” he said, noting that the government will be rolling out an advertising campaign aimed at driving that home.

He urged Canadians to understand that “listening [to those directives] is your duty, and staying home is your way to serve.”

If Canadians do not get the message and stay home, the government could act to force them.

“We will look at different measures that could be necessary to enforce these measures. We’d rather not … I can tell you that we haven’t taken anything off the table from the Emergencies Act, new and existing measures under the Quarantine Act,” Trudeau continued.

“We are impressing upon Canadians to do this of their own will.”

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam echoed those calls during a ministerial press conference shortly after Trudeau spoke to reporters.

“Canadians must practice social and physical distancing,” urged Freeland. “That means stay at home unless you are doing essential work like stocking grocery stores, staffing pharmacies and providing medical care.”

Tam said “unrelenting social distancing” is needed in order to slow community spread of the virus.

On Sunday, Trudeau announced the House of Commons will reconvene on Tuesday to pass legislation — which includes an $82-billion aid package — to support Canadians impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Trudeau said the government is working closely with provinces and territories in the fight against COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but that Canada is not at the point where the Emergencies Act needs to be invoked.

On Saturday, Trudeau said the government is working with commercial airlines in order to repatriate Canadians stranded abroad.

The first of those flights — from Casablanca, Morocco — landed in Montreal on Saturday.

Trudeau said the government is working to secure flights to other locations, including Peru and Spain, in the coming days but said the government will not be able to help all Canadians seeking assistance.

Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said officials have been in touch with “hundreds of thousands” of Canadians abroad and are “working around the clock” to provide help.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), by 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, more than 1,400 cases of the virus had been confirmed in the country, with the majority reported in Ontario and B.C.

So far, 20 people have died in Canada from COVID-19, PHAC said.","                                                       Skip to Main Content    Global News Home      Watch  Subscribe     Search                  World Canada Local Local Politics Money Health Entertainment Lifestyle Watch Sports Commentary Contests Podcasts    ‘Enough is enough’: Trudeau warns Canadians flouting coronavirus social distancing            Leave a comment            Share this item on Facebook            Share this item via WhatsApp            Share this item on Twitter            Send this page to someone via email            Share this item                           Full Menu                 Search Menu                Home           Trending           Watch           Local         Menu          Menu   Close            Submit Search        Topics  World Canada Local Change location Politics Money Health Entertainment Lifestyle Watch Sports Commentary Contests Podcasts    TV Programs  Global National West Block Personalities Video Centre More…    Connect  Email alerts Alexa Notifications Contact Us        National      Change  Close     Change  Close     Barrie BC Calgary Durham Edmonton Guelph Halifax Hamilton Kingston Kitchener Lethbridge London Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Ottawa Peterborough Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg        Global News Facebook Pages       Global News Twitter Accounts       Global News Youtube Channel       Global News on Instagram       Global News on Linked-In       Global News on Pinterest       Global News RSS Feeds                    Close      Local        your local region   National      Barrie BC Calgary Durham Edmonton Guelph Halifax Hamilton Kingston Kitchener Lethbridge London Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Ottawa Peterborough Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg           Share             Share this item on Facebook     facebook      Share this item via WhatsApp     whatsapp      Share this item on Twitter     twitter      Send this page to someone via email     email      Share this item on Pinterest     pinterest      Share this item on LinkedIn     linkedin      Share this item on Reddit     reddit      Copy article link     Copy link            Search             Submit search        Suggested Search                              Trending Now                                                                                                       Comments   Close comments menu             Want to discuss?

https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.



Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.



The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching your face. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. Stay home if you feel unwell. Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs. Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.        Symptoms      COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization. Most common symptoms: fever. dry cough. tiredness. Less common symptoms: aches and pains. sore throat. diarrhoea. conjunctivitis. headache. loss of taste or smell. a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-coronavirus-inject-disinfectant-bleach-treatment-sunlight-a9481291.html,"Donald Trump, a businessman by training and trade, floated more trial medical balloons on Thursday night – repeatedly suggesting disinfectant be injected into the bodies of humans to cure coronavirus patients while doubling down on his claims that sunlight kills the deadly virus.

“I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” the president said during his daily Covid-19 briefing. A senior health official, under questioning from reporters, later said federal laboratories are not considering or trying to develop such a treatment option.

Mr Trump continued to launch trial balloons, some of which catch on with his core supporters and others that can cause a ruckus for several hours before fading from the public consciousness.

“You see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number [on the] lungs, so it would be interesting to check that,” he said, appearing to refer to the disinfectant idea. “We’re going to have to use medical doctors, but it seems interesting to me.”

The president, appearing to go off his prepared opening remarks, made this declaration: “We’re very close to a vaccine.”

But Anthony Fauci, his top infectious disease official, has said such a drug will be in development for up to 18 months. He has told the president in public meetings that one full year from the start of vaccine development, which began in March, would be the fastest one could be safely deployed.

Mr Fauci told CBS News earlier this year it could be possible to “shave” a few months off the development of a vaccine, but he cautioned against giving scientific processes too little time to ensure a drug would work and be safe.

Trump vs Fauci



The president and his top infectious disease official had another public disagreement come into public view during the Thursday evening briefing. This time, it was over testing following Mr Fauci saying in an interview that the United States needs to “significantly” ramp up its testing for the virus.

“No, I don’t agree with him on that. I think we are doing a grab job on testing,” Mr Trump told reporters. “If he said that, I don’t agree with him.”

That came after Mr Fauci told Time that “we need to significantly ramp up not only the number of tests, but the capacity to perform them, so that you don’t have a situation where you have a test but it can’t be done because there isn’t a swab, or because there isn’t extraction media, or not the right vial”, adding: “I am not overly confident right now, at all, that we have what it takes to do that. We are doing better, and I think we are going to get there, but we are not there yet.”



But hours later, Mr Trump repeated his glowing assessment of his administration’s record on Covid-19 testing kits – even though Democratic congressional leaders, some Democratic governors in hard-hit states, and even some GOP state leaders are still begging him to do more to get more testing units into their hands.

“We’re doing very well on testing,” the president said. “We’ve tested far more than anyone else in the world and within a short period of time.”

Public health officials say the US is testing about 150,000 people per day; they estimate that figure needs to be closer to 500,000 each day.

‘Not as a treatment’

Echoing more vague comments from the president minutes earlier, the vice president, Mike Pence, announced there is “encouraging” news about how “heat and sunlight” affect coronavirus.

William Bryan, a senior Homeland Security official, said a recent study showed summer-level solar waves can slash an 18-hour half life for Covid-19 into a 1-hour half life.

“Solar light” has an effect of “killing the virus”, Mr Bryan said. “In summary ... the virus in droplets in salvia survives best in indoor, dry conditions ... It dies the quickest in the presence of sunlight.”

But Deborah Birx, one of Mr Trump’s coronavirus task force members, disagreed that the sun’s rays could be used to help virus victims, saying: “Not as a treatment.”

The president said earlier this year he expected the virus would dissipate under the spring’s warmer temperatures; Mr Trump was incorrect, and the virus continues to spread, now to rural areas that were initially mostly Covid-free.

One former federal official seemed astonished by Mr Trump’s latest bold claims.

“We have to do this with science. If the president thinks that tanning beds are going to cure the coronavirus, he’s mistaken, Jonathan Reiner, a George W Bush White House medical official told CNN after the president’s briefing wrapped.

‘Free pass’

After bashing Democrats for, in his words, “playing politics” surrounding the virus, the GOP president called it “interesting” that the hardest hit states are “blue” ones.



He went after the former vice president Joe Biden, his presumptive Democratic general election foe, saying he is “in his basement” and “not moving around too much”, but getting a “free pass” from media outlets. Mr Trump appeared to suggest Mr Biden is unable to be mobile – even though the Democratic nominee is abiding by travel restrictions and a state stay-at-home order.

Where the president has this week declared the virus soon will subside, without providing scientific data to support the claim, Mr Pence on Thursday even was more qualified.

He told reporters, if current trends hold and Americans keep participating in safety measures, the country “could be” back to normal by “early summer”. At another moment, he said administration officials have “confidence” about the summer months.",

25 March 2020

No pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries.

In many countries, doctors are giving COVID-19 patients medicines that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered “off-label” use. The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. All health care workers should be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations governing their practice. Further, such prescribing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided.

It can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials, provided that no proven effective treatment exists; it is not possible to initiate clinical studies immediately; the patient or his or her legal representative has given informed consent; and the emergency use of the intervention is monitored, and the results are documented and shared in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community.[1]

The decision to offer a patient an unproven or experimental treatment is between the doctor and the patient but must comply with national law. Where it is possible and feasible for the treatment to be given as part of a clinical trial, this should be done unless the patient declines to participate in the trial.

If it is not possible to give the treatment as part of a clinical trial, appropriate records of the use of the medicine must be kept, in compliance with national law, and outcomes for patients should be monitored and recorded.

If early results from an unproven or experimental treatment are promising, the treatment should be studied in the context of a formal clinical trial to establish its safety, efficacy, risks, and benefits.

The trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine. Data from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care. Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician. This decision applies only to the conduct of the Solidarity trial and does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.

Ten out of 54 countries are currently driving the rise in numbers, accounting for nearly 80% of all the cases. More than 70% of the deaths are taking place in only five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan. WHO and other partners have supported governments with scaling up health workforce and laboratory capacities and to set up points-of-entry screening at airports and border crossings. These public health and social measures have been effective in slowing
        the spread of COVID-19 in Africa.  More than 200,000 #COVID19 cases have been confirmed on the African continent, with over 5,600 deaths.

More than half (53%) of the countries surveyed have partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment; 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications; 42% for cancer treatment, and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies. Rehabilitation services have been disrupted in almost two-thirds (63%) of countries, even though rehabilitation is key to a healthy recovery following severe illness from COVID-19. In the majority (94%) of countries responding, ministry of health staff working in the area of NCDs were partially or fully reassigned to support COVID-19.

Provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries. Since March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s. The reasons for disrupted services vary. Some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement, lack of information or because they fear infection with the COVID-19 virus. And many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions
    on travel, or redeployment to COVID response duties, as well as a lack of protective equipment. Transport delays of vaccines are also exacerbating the situation. Despite the challenges, several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. Uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services, even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities.
    And in Lao PDR, despite a national lockdown imposed in March, routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place.

This surveillance provides a more complete picture of impact, particularly for deaths that may be indirectly related to COVID-19. It also addresses the indirect impact caused by disruptions in healthcare access and supply chains. When policy-makers can compare estimated weekly number of excess deaths related to COVID-19 compared with pre-pandemic levels, they have a powerful tool to inform their national response and recovery planning.

The resolution, co-sponsored by more than 130 countries, was adopted by consensus. It calls for the intensification of efforts to control the pandemic, and for equitable access to and fair distribution of all essential health technologies and products to combat the virus. It also calls for an independent and comprehensive evaluation
    of the global response, including, but not limited to, WHO’s performance. As WHO convened ministers of health from almost every country in the world, the consistent message throughout the two-day meeting—including from the 14 heads of state participating in the opening and closing sessions —was that global unity
    is the most powerful tool to combat the outbreak. The resolution is a concrete manifestation of this call, and a roadmap for controlling the outbreak. In his closing remarks to the Assembly, the DIrector-General outlined how WHO is fighting COVID-19 with every tool at its disposal.

Recently, however, reports from Europe and North America have described clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease
    and toxic shock syndrome. It is essential to characterize this syndrome and its risk factors, to understand causality, and describe treatment interventions. It is not yet clear the full spectrum of disease, and whether the geographical distribution in Europe and North America
    reflects a true pattern, or if the condition has simply not been recognized elsewhere. There is therefore an urgent need for collection of standardized data describing clinical presentations, severity, outcomes, and epidemiology. WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and case report form for multisystem inflammatory disorder in
    children and adolescents. The case definition will be revised as more data become available. In addition to more detail on the above, the Scientific Brief also includes information on the preliminary case definition and Global COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform.

From risk of exposure and biological susceptibility to infection to the social and economic implications, individuals’ experiences are likely to vary according to their biological and gender characteristics and their interaction with other social
    determinants. COVID-19 strategic plans must be grounded in strong gender analysis and ensure meaningful participation of women and girls in decision-making and implementation. WHO calls on its Member States and all global actors to guide investments in quality and gender-sensitive research on the adverse health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19. Countries are advised to incorporate a focus on gender into their COVID-19 responses in order to ensure that public health policies and measures to curb the pandemic account for gender and how it interacts with other inequalities.

Frontline health-care workers, women, children, adolescents, older persons and people with pre-existing mental health conditions are all at particular risk. A rise in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts. The increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to mental health services in many countries. In concrete terms, it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. Many countries have changed their approach to the provision of this support in ways that are showing signs of success. Support for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness, particularly for the most vulnerable, must also continue.

Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular
        disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. A review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on 29 April 2020 found that smokers are more likely
        to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine
        in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.  There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of #COVID19 .

The worst case scenario considered by the modelling group was a 6-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy. The group suggested that this could lead to more than 500 000 extra deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, including from tuberculosis, in sub-Saharan
    Africa over the next year. At a media briefing today the WHO Director-General said that the modelling should be a “wake-up call,” and that despite attention being focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, we must still ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments
    for both HIV and TB reach the countries and communities that need them most.

WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 11 May 2020     New guidance on surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection 10 May 2020 This guidance document provides an overview of strategies that Member States should consider as part of comprehensive national surveillance for COVID-19. It emphasises the need to adapt and reinforce existing national systems where appropriate and to scale-up surveillance capacities as needed. Generally speaking, digital technologies for rapid reporting, data management, and analysis will be helpful. Robust comprehensive surveillance should be maintained even in areas where there are few or no cases; it is critical that new cases and clusters are detected rapidly and before widespread disease transmission occurs. Ongoing surveillance is also important to understand longer-term trends in the disease and the evolution of the virus. Surveillance can be community-based and take place at the primary care level. Existing sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) is useful to monitor COVID-19 transmission trends. There should also be enhanced surveillance for residential facilities and vulnerable groups. Key materials: Surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection Operational considerations for COVID-19 surveillance using GISRS: interim guidance Critical preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19    New guidance on contact tracing 10 May 2020 Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission. When systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and is an essential public health tool for controlling the virus. Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and following them up daily for 14 days from the last point of exposure. This document provides guidance on how to establish contact tracing capacity for the control of COVID-19, covering issues such as the ideal profile of a contact tracer and what to do if a contact cannot be reached. Critical elements of the implementation of contact tracing are community engagement and public support; careful planning and consideration of local contexts, communities, and cultures; a workforce of trained contact tracers and supervisors; logistics support to contact tracing teams; and a system to collate, compile, and analyse data in real-time.

Key materials: News release    40th anniversary of global eradication of smallpox holds lessons for overcoming COVID-19 8 May 2020 On May 8 1980, the World Health Assembly confirmed the eradication of smallpox, marking the end of a disease that had plagued humanity for at least 3000 years, killing 300 million people in the 20th century alone. It was ended thanks to a 10-year global effort, spearheaded by the World Health Organization, that involved thousands of health workers around the world to administer half a billion vaccinations to stamp out smallpox. Speaking at a virtual event hosted at WHO-HQ, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus outlined what the eradication of smallpox can teach us about using basic public health solutions, science and solidarity to rise to the challenge of COVID-19. ""Many of the basic public health tools that were used successfully then are the same tools that have been used to respond to Ebola, and to COVID-19: disease surveillance, case finding, contact tracing, and mass communication campaigns to inform affected populations.” Smallpox eradication was only possible because of a safe and effective vaccine. With COVID-19, WHO is working to drive forward the ‘Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator’, which aims to ensure that new health technologies will be developed, manufactured and distributed equitably. Dr Tedros noted that humanity’s victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat: ""The decisive factor in the victory over smallpox was global solidarity. At the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States of America joined forces to conquer a common enemy. They recognized that viruses do not respect nations or ideologies.”  Key materials WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 8 May 2020 Video recording of 8 May 2020 media briefing LinkedIn article: Lessons from Smallpox Eradication Should Inspire Effort to Overcome COVID-19 Video: 40th anniversary of smallpox eradication    UN issues $6.7 billion appeal to protect millions in fragile countries 7 May 2020 An update to the UN’s Global Humanitarian Response Plan was launched today by the Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan; UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Mark Lowcock; President and CEO of Oxfam America, Abby Maxman; UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi; and Executive Director of the World Food Programme, David Beasley. Dr Ryan emphasized that helping the most vulnerable to confront COVID-19 is not just a moral imperative, it is in enlightened self interest: ""It is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. We won't be safe – anywhere on this planet – until all people are safe.""

Testing, isolating and treating people with COVID-19 and tracing their contacts is also challenging in places with weaker health
        systems. Public health and social measures in these settings must be balanced against other risks, such as lack of income, limited access to basic services, food insecurity, and lack of a social safety net. Measures also need to be pragmatic and leverage the
        strengths of local structures and systems, notably through social mobilization and strong community engagement. This interim guidance outlines how to adapt COVID-19 prevention and response measures for use in low capacity and humanitarian settings.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2) has increased demand for medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and reagents, all related to COVID-19, creating an opportunity for ill-intended persons to distribute falsified medical products Due diligence is required from all actors in the procurement, use and administration of medical products, in particular those affected by the current crisis of, or related to, COVID-19. At this stage, WHO does not recommend any medicines to treat or cure COVID-19. However, the SOLIDARITY trial, led by WHO, is reviewing potential treatments for COVID-19.

All of humanity must fight back. UN Secretary General's Remarks      Off-label use of medicines for COVID-19 25 March 2020 No pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries. In many countries, doctors are giving COVID-19 patients medicines that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered “off-label” use. The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. All health care workers should be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations governing their practice. Further, such prescribing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided. It can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials, provided that no proven effective treatment exists; it is not possible to initiate clinical studies immediately; the patient or his or her legal representative has given informed consent; and the emergency use of the intervention is monitored, and the results are documented and shared in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community. [1] The decision to offer a patient an unproven or experimental treatment is between the doctor and the patient but must comply with national law. Where it is possible and feasible for the treatment to be given as part of a clinical trial, this should be done unless the patient declines to participate in the trial. If it is not possible to give the treatment as part of a clinical trial, appropriate records of the use of the medicine must be kept, in compliance with national law, and outcomes for patients should be monitored and recorded. If early results from an unproven or experimental treatment are promising, the treatment should be studied in the context of a formal clinical trial to establish its safety, efficacy, risks, and benefits.

'Be Ready' was launched because everyone can prepare for COVID-19, including individuals, governments and businesses. We're calling on people to Be Safe by remembering tried & tested public health measures, like regular hand washing & staying at least 1 metre (3 feet) from anyone coughing or sneezing. These ordinary measures are extraordinarily
    effective at fighting COVID-19. We're asking people to Be Smart about COVID-19 by rejecting rumours & taking care to only share information from trusted sources. Everyone should keep informed about what is happening in their area and follow the recommendations
    of local authorities. We're reminding people to Be Kind through addressing stigma and looking out for one another - especially the most vulnerable and those in isolation.

https://sunnybrook.ca/research/media/item.asp?c=2&i=2069&f=covid-19-isolated-2020#.XmqdRmlrVfY.twitter,"A team of researchers from Sunnybrook, McMaster University and the University of Toronto has isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.

Thanks to nimble collaboration, the team was able to culture the virus from two clinical specimens in a Level 3 containment facility.

“We need key tools to develop solutions to this pandemic. While the immediate response is crucial, longer-term solutions come from essential research into this novel virus,” said Dr. Samira Mubareka, microbiologist and infectious diseases physician at Sunnybrook.

The isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, evolution and clinical shedding.

“Researchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,” said Dr. Rob Kozak, clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook. “It demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate.”

Dr. Arinjay Banerjee, NSERC post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University, said he knows the collaboration won’t stop there.

“Now that we have isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we can share this with other researchers and continue this teamwork,” he said. “The more viruses that are made available in this way, the more we can learn, collaborate and share.”

Congratulations to the researchers from these three Canadian institutions: Dr. Samira Mubareka and Dr. Rob Kozak of Sunnybrook and University of Toronto; Dr. Arinjay Banerjee and Dr. Karen Mossman of McMaster University.

With gratitude to the CL3 team and Biosafety Officers.

https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/news/covid-19-vaccine-candidate-shows-promise-first-peer-reviewed-research,"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine scientists announced a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. When tested in mice, the vaccine, delivered through a fingertip-sized patch, produces antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 at quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralizing the virus.

The paper appeared April 2 in eBioMedicine, which is published by The Lancet, and is the first study to be published after critique from fellow scientists at outside institutions that describes a candidate vaccine for COVID-19. The researchers were able to act quickly because they had already laid the groundwork during earlier coronavirus epidemics.

“We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus,” said co-senior author Andrea Gambotto, associate professor of surgery at the Pitt School of Medicine. “That’s why it’s important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from.”

“Our ability to rapidly develop this vaccine was a result of scientists with expertise in diverse areas of research working together with a common goal,” said co-senior author Louis Falo, professor and chair of dermatology at Pitt’s School of Medicine and UPMC.

Compared to the experimental mRNA vaccine candidate that just entered clinical trials, the vaccine described in this paper—which the authors are calling PittCoVacc, short for Pittsburgh CoronaVirus Vaccine—follows a more established approach, using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity. It’s the same way the current flu shots work.

The researchers also used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency. This array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. The patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles—which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces—simply dissolve into the skin.

“We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,” Falo said. “And it’s actually pretty painless—it feels kind of like Velcro.”

The system is also highly scalable. The protein pieces are manufactured by a “cell factory”—layers upon layers of cultured cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein—that can be stacked further to multiply yield. Purifying the protein can also be done at industrial scale. Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mold using a centrifuge. Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it’s needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.

“For most vaccines, you don’t need to address scalability to begin with,” Gambotto said. “But when you try to develop a vaccine quickly against a pandemic that’s the first requirement.”

When tested in mice, PittCoVacc generated a surge of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the microneedle prick.

Those animals haven’t been tracked long term yet, but the researchers point out that mice who got their MERS-CoV vaccine produced a sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the virus for at least a year, and so far the antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals seem to be following the same trend.

Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 microneedle vaccine maintains its potency even after being thoroughly sterilized with gamma radiation—a key step toward making a product that’s suitable for use in humans.

The authors are now in the process of applying for an investigational new drug (IND) approval from the Food and Drug Administration in anticipation of starting a phase I human clinical trial in the next few months.

“Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,” Falo said. “This particular situation is different from anything we’ve ever seen, so we don’t know how long the clinical development process will take.

When tested in mice, the vaccine, delivered through a fingertip-sized patch, produces antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 at quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralizing the virus.  The paper appeared April 2 in eBioMedicine , which is published by The Lancet, and is the first study to be published after critique from fellow scientists at outside institutions that describes a candidate vaccine for COVID-19. The researchers were able to act quickly because they had already laid the groundwork during earlier coronavirus epidemics.  “We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus,” said co-senior author Andrea Gambotto , associate professor of surgery at the Pitt School of Medicine. “That’s why it’s important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from.”  “Our ability to rapidly develop this vaccine was a result of scientists with expertise in diverse areas of research working together with a common goal,” said co-senior author Louis Falo , professor and chair of dermatology at Pitt’s School of Medicine and UPMC .  Compared to the experimental mRNA vaccine candidate that just entered clinical trials , the vaccine described in this paper—which the authors are calling PittCoVacc, short for Pittsburgh CoronaVirus Vaccine—follows a more established approach, using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity. It’s the same way the current flu shots work.  The researchers also used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency. This array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. The patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles—which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces—simply dissolve into the skin.  “We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,” Falo said. “And it’s actually pretty painless—it feels kind of like Velcro.”    The system is also highly scalable. The protein pieces are manufactured by a “cell factory”—layers upon layers of cultured cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein—that can be stacked further to multiply yield. Purifying the protein can also be done at industrial scale. Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mold using a centrifuge. Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it’s needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.  “For most vaccines, you don’t need to address scalability to begin with,” Gambotto said. “But when you try to develop a vaccine quickly against a pandemic that’s the first requirement.”  When tested in mice, PittCoVacc generated a surge of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the microneedle prick.  Those animals haven’t been tracked long term yet, but the researchers point out that mice who got their MERS-CoV vaccine produced a sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the virus for at least a year, and so far the antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals seem to be following the same trend.  Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 microneedle vaccine maintains its potency even after being thoroughly sterilized with gamma radiation—a key step toward making a product that’s suitable for use in humans.  The authors are now in the process of applying for an investigational new drug (IND) approval from the Food and Drug Administration in anticipation of starting a phase I human clinical trial in the next few months.  “Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,” Falo said. “This particular situation is different from anything we’ve ever seen, so we don’t know how long the clinical development process will take. Recently announced revisions to the normal processes suggest we may be able to advance this faster.”  Additional authors on the study are Eun Kim, Geza Erdos, Shaohua Huang, Thomas Kenniston, Stephen Balmert, Cara Donahue Carey, Michael Epperly, William Klimstra and Emrullah Korkmaz, all of Pitt; and Bart Haagmans, of Erasmus Medical Center.

https://www.inverse.com/science/pets-covid-19,"Pets are not immune to the Covid-19 pandemic. A new study sheds light on where the risks lie, and, what pet owners should do to protect your furbaby and your family.

So, how worried do you need to be about your pet becoming infected with the novel coronavirus? The answer may depend on what type of pet you have.

In the study, researchers reveal that dogs are relatively safe from Covid-19 infection.

Cats and ferrets, by contrast, are “permissive to infection.”

Here’s the breakdown of which animals are at risk:

The virus that causes Covid-19 replicates efficiently in these animals. That means they ARE potentially at risk:

Ferrets

Cats

The virus replicates poorly in these animals. That means they are likely NOT at risk:

Dogs

Pigs

Chickens

Ducks

To see which animals are susceptible, researchers gave the virus to each animal through their nose or throat, and then measured how well it had replicated in various parts of the body.

In cats and ferrets, the virus took hold, replicating in the upper respiratory tract (but not in the lungs, like in humans). Older cats may be at particular risk, the study suggests.

Cats may also be susceptible to airborne transmission of the virus, the results suggest.

These results aren't just important information for pet owners — they indicate that ferrets, which are frequently used as a model to test vaccines and drugs before human trials, may be the ideal animal model to test treatments for Covid-19.

Can your pet give you coronavirus?

Of the animals in the study, pet cats, and especially senior felines, appear most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, either by direct contact with the virus or through airborne transmission.

There is no evidence of cat-to-cat transmission so far. But the results speak to a different fear — that pets could transmit the virus to humans.

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so far, ""there is no evidence that pets can spread the virus to people.""

At the same time, we do know that the coronavirus originated in animals before making the leap to humans.

But how animals may spread the novel coronavirus remains a mystery, and so is the animal that first spread it to humans.

Researchers believe that the Covid-19 virus originated in bats. But they also theorize that a different, intermediate animal spread the virus from bats to humans.

Pangolins, a curious species traded by poachers and valued for their meat and scales, are among the key suspects. Snakes, originally reported to be the source of the virus, have been largely ruled out.

How to protect pets from coronavirus

Keep your pets close to home — The new study may cause some concern, but importantly, it also spells out what you should to to make sure your pet stays safe.

Engaging in this kind of ""animal management"" may help control the spread of the virus, the study authors say.

Take cats. The new study finds that “cats are susceptible to airborne infection,” meaning it may be more important than ever to keep your cat indoors.

Cats can also be fomites, or surfaces the virus can live on. The British Veterinary Association has warned cat owners who are self-isolating to keep their cats indoors. Doing so will prevent cats in a home with coronavirus-positive humans from bringing the virus elsewhere.

In a statement released earlier this week, the association's president, Daniella Dos Santos, agreed with a recommendation that all cats should be kept indoors during the outbreak, as BBC News reported at the time.

The association has since clarified in a statement released on its website:

“Only cats from infected households or where their owners are self-isolating, and only if the cat is happy to be kept indoors.”

Avoid close contact, but only if you are sick — Difficult as it may be to avoid cuddling with your pets, the CDC says that, if you're sick, you need to keep your distance.

""Avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food,"" the CDC website says.

""When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.""

Regardless of whether you are sick or healthy, keep washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene around your pets. Research suggests it's possible to be infected with the novel coronavirus and show no symptoms — while still spreading it to others.

So when it comes to pets, the safest bet may be to just keep your cat indoors.

The case of a big cat getting coronavirus illustrates why that is more necessary than ever: Nadia, a tiger in the Bronx Zoo tested positive last weekend for Covid-19, according to The New York Times. Her symptoms have included a dry cough and slight appetite loss, the Times reports.

While risks remain for cats big and small, these developments aren’t necessarily cause for panic.

Neither Nadia nor the domestic cats studied “actually ever acted terribly sick,” Bronx Zoo veterinarian Paul Calle told the Times.

An experiment in a lab — like injecting a big dose of the virus through a cat’s nose — “does not replicate what is happening in people’s homes around the world,"" Calle points out.

In fact, cats may not be “generally susceptible” to getting sick from the novel coronavirus, he says. Good news for pet owners worried about their family or their pet's safety.

Editor's note: Since this story was published, two cats in New York state have been diagnosed with Covid-19, and the CDC has updated its guidelines for pet owners — more information here.

Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but ferrets and cats are permissive to infection. We found experimentally that cats are susceptible to airborne infection. Our study provides important insights into the animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.","Paw patrol Can your pet get Covid-19?

https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1844,"Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies. However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.

Results In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group). Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission. In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1). Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6). At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

Because of the lack of unbiased data and the urgency of determining the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19, we used observational data collected in a real world setting in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who required oxygen. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of oral hydroxychloroquine at a daily dose of 600 mg on admissions to the intensive care unit or death by any cause. Secondary outcomes included the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in reducing the duration of oxygen requirement.

Based on the results of these studies and the negligible cost and known safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in treating rheumatic conditions, this drug has been considered to be potentially useful in treating patients with covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine has attracted attention in social and mass media, and has also received US Food and Drug Administration approval for patients with severe covid-19. 7 However, fears have increased about a shortage of this essential treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematus, 8 and questions have been raised about its safety in patients with covid-19.

The World Health Organization declared pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is resulting in fatal pneumonia. Treatments are urgently needed to prevent hypoxaemic respiratory failure and death. 1 Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention after an in vitro study reported its potential activity against SARS-CoV-2, 2 and small studies have released promising results. However, the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19 is the subject of serious debate. 3 One uncontrolled French study included 26 hospital inpatients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on a nasopharyngeal swab. The study suggested that 600 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 shedding and when combined with azithromycin it was more efficacious. 4 However, another uncontrolled French study found no evidence of antiviral clearance with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 patients admitted to hospital. 5 A recent study randomised 62 patients into two parallel groups: a control group and a group receiving hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day for five days). The study reported a shorter time to clinical recovery in the hydroxychloroquine group. 6 However, these patients were not severely ill, the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined, and there was no stratification for comorbidities known to be associated with a poor outcome. 6

Missing baseline variables were handled by multiple imputation by chained equations using the other variables available. All statistical analyses were performed with the R statistical package version 3.6.1 or later (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, https://www.R-project.org/ ).

We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Firstly, we conducted a trimmed analysis that was truncated at the region of common support, defined as the overlap between the range of propensity scores in the treatment group and the control group. Patients with propensity scores outside the region of common support were excluded from this analysis. Secondly, to account for time dependent bias, we performed an analysis in which all patients from the control group who reached the primary outcome (transfer to intensive care unit or death) during the grace period were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, given that their observational data were compatible with both groups at the time of the event. 17

Our causal contrast of interest was the per protocol effect, and we compared participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission with those who did not receive the drug. Because some patients subsequently received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours, we specified two additional comparisons. Firstly, mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis: all patients eligible for the study were analysed, and those who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the control group. Secondly, mimicking an as-treated analysis: patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the treatment group.

Crude survival rates were computed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratios. Inverse probability of treatment weighting estimates of the relative risk were computed for binary outcomes. Outcomes are presented in the total population and in the subgroup of patients with a better prognosis at admission, estimated by a quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 2. 15 16

An inverse probability of treatment weighting approach was used to balance the differences in baseline variables between treatment groups. 11 12 A non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to estimate each patient’s probability of receiving hydroxychloroquine given their baseline covariates (that is, the propensity score). Variables of the propensity score model were planned and prespecified before outcome analyses. Several variables were included: age, sex, comorbidities (presence of chronic respiratory insufficiency during oxygen treatment, or asthma, cystic fibrosis, or any chronic respiratory disease likely to result in decompensation during a viral infection; heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV); chronic kidney disease; liver cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class B or more; personal history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, or cardiac surgery); insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or diabetic microangiopathy or macroangiopathy; treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, including anticancer chemotherapy; uncontrolled HIV infection or HIV infection with CD4 cell counts <200/µL; or a haematological malignancy); body mass index (≥30 or not); third trimester of pregnancy; treatment by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers 13 ; time since symptom onset; and severity of condition at admission (percentage of lung affected: ≥50% or not; presence of confusion; respiratory frequency; oxygen saturation without oxygen; oxygen flow; systolic blood pressure; and C reactive protein level).

The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Patients who received hydroxychloroquine had QT prolongation assessed by a 12 lead electrocardiogram and corrected for heart rate by Bazett’s or Fredericia’s formula at the start of treatment and for three to five days after.

The start of follow-up (baseline or time zero) for each patient was the time of admission to hospital. All patients were followed up from baseline until death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up on 24 April 2020, whichever occurred first.

We compared two treatment strategies: starting hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day (treatment group) and no hydroxychloroquine treatment (control group). The dose was chosen after publication of the first study on hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19. 4 Patients in the treatment group could start treatment within a grace period of 48 hours after admission. The decision of whether or not to treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus and the clinicians’ own opinion of its effectiveness. The decision was made before patients were admitted to hospital and so their characteristics played no part. Supplementary data 1 provides additional information about the number of patients in each group in each hospital.

The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, as amended, and received approval by the appropriate IRB, which included an amendment for the extension of follow-up (No 2020_060, Hôpitaux Universitaires Henri-Mondor, AP-HP).

Exclusion criteria were the presence of a contraindication to hydroxychloroquine at 600 mg/day (including patients receiving dialysis); hydroxychloroquine treatment started before admission to hospital; treatment with another experimental drug for covid-19 (tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, or remdesivir) within 48 hours after admission; organ failure that required immediate admission to the intensive care unit or continuous care unit; acute respiratory distress syndrome at admission (defined by the need for non-invasive ventilation with provision of continuous positive airway pressure or invasive mechanical ventilation) 10 ; discharge from the intensive care unit to standard care; decision to limit and stop active treatments prescribed at admission; and opposition to data collection by patients or their legal representative.

We used data collected from routine care to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and who required oxygen. 9 Physicians screened the electronic health records of all patients with covid-19 pneumonia admitted to four French tertiary hospitals between 12 March and 31 March 2020. Patients were eligible for this study if they were aged 18-80 years, had PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (supplementary data 1), and required oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (corresponding to a WHO progression score of 5).

Of the 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within the first 48 hours, eight (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine at a median of 4 days (interquartile range 3-9 days) after it began, which is in accordance with French national guidelines. Among these patients, seven had a corrected QT interval prolongation of more than 60 ms (including one patient with corrected QT interval prolongation >500 ms). One patient who received no other drugs that might have interfered with cardiac conduction presented a first degree atrioventricular block after two days of hydroxychloroquine treatment. One patient in whom hydroxychloroquine was started five days after admission (control group) was transferred to intensive care two days later. This patient was then prescribed lopinavir and ritonavir and developed left bundle branch block on day 8. None of these patients was concomitantly treated with azithromycin.

Finally, adding the eight patients who received hydroxychloroquine treatment more than 48 hours after admission (for a population of 181) and including them in the treatment group (mimicking an as-treated analysis) or in the control group (mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis) did not change the results (weighted hazard ratio 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1), and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.9) for the primary outcome, respectively; supplementary data 8 and 9).

Our results also suggested that patients with fewer symptoms and better prognosis at admission did not respond to hydroxychloroquine (quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 2: n=73 in the treatment group and n=76 in the control group): weighted hazard ratio 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.6) for survival without transfer to intensive care unit; weighted hazard ratio 1.8 (0.6 to 5.9) for overall survival; weighted hazard ratio 1.6 (0.7 to 3.3) for survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome; weighted relative risk 1.0 (0.9 to 1.2) for oxygen weaning; weighted relative risk 0.9 (0.7 to 1.1) for discharge to home or rehabilitation.

At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Furthermore, 76% of patients in the treatment group had been discharged to home or rehabilitation compared with 82% in the control group (0.9, 0.8 to 1.2; table 2 ). All sensitivity analyses were consistent with the principal analysis and found that hydroxychloroquine had no effect on any outcome (supplementary data 7).

In the inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses that took imbalance at baseline into account, among the 173 patients in the two groups, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1; fig 2 ). The overall survival rate at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). The rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6; table 2 , supplementary data 5 and 6).

At day 21, 79% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 74% in the control group (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Furthermore, 80% of patients in both groups had been discharged to home or rehabilitation (1.0, 0.9 to 1.2; table 2 ). None of the 15 patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was transferred to intensive care and none died. Additionally, these patients had fewer severe signs at admission compared with patients who received hydroxychloroquine without azithromycin (oxygen flow: 2 L/min, interquartile range 1.25-4 v 3 L/min, 2-6; respiratory frequency: 25 per min, interquartile range 22-33 v 28 per min, 24-32; percentage of lung affected >50%: 13% v 17%). Finally, 26 patients received azithromycin without hydroxychloroquine. Among these patients, six were admitted to the intensive care unit and five died.

A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to estimate each patient’s probability of receiving hydroxychloroquine given their baseline covariates (that is, the propensity score: variables in model included age, sex, and comorbidities). ICU=intensive care unit

In the non-weighted analyses, among the 173 patients in the two treatment groups, the rate of survival without transfer to intensive care at 21 days was 80% in the treatment group compared with 75% in the control group (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.5; fig 2 ). The overall survival rate at 21 days was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.5 to 3.0). The rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70% in the treatment group and 74% in the control group (1.2, 0.7 to 2.2; table 2 , supplementary data 5 and 6).

Median follow-up for surviving patients was 32.5 days; three patients (one in the treatment group and two in the control group; 2%) were lost to follow-up after being discharged in good health and without oxygen. Two other patients had a follow-up of only 20 days. At day 21, 17 of 173 (10%) patients had died (nine in the treatment group and eight in the control group).

Propensity scores ranged from 0.09 to 0.95 in the treatment group and from 0.01 to 0.91 in the control group, with 96% in the region of common support (propensity scores 0.09-0.91; supplementary data 2). After inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied, 15 of the 19 covariates in the planned propensity score had weighted standardised differences below 10%; four covariates (confusion on admission, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), and liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or more)) exceeded the threshold (supplementary data 3). These results were owing to the absence of confusion on admission in the treatment group (compared with six patients with confusion in the control group); only one patient had chronic kidney disease in the treatment group (compared with eight in the control group); only one patient had chronic heart failure in the treatment group (compared with five in the control group); and only one patient had liver cirrhosis in the treatment group (compared with no patients in the control group). These four variables were therefore not included in the final propensity score model (supplementary data 4).

Among the 181 patients eligible for analysis, 84 received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission, eight received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission, and 89 did not receive hydroxychloroquine ( fig 1 ). To assess a per protocol effect, our main analysis compared the 84 participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours (treatment group) with the 89 who did not receive the drug (control group). The median age of patients was 60 years (interquartile range 52-68 years), and 72% were men. Patients in the treatment group had fewer comorbidities, except for liver cirrhosis. The median interval between symptom onset and admission to hospital was 7 days (interquartile range 5-10 days). Overall, initial severity was well balanced between the groups, except for confusion on admission (0 in the treatment group v 6 (7%) in the control group). Azithromycin was administered to 18% of the participants in the treatment group versus 29% in the control group; amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was given to 52% versus 28%, respectively (excluding cointerventions in patients transferred to the intensive care unit; table 1 ). No patients received antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not used as antipyretics in adults in France and are considered to be contraindicated for covid-19) before transfer to the intensive care unit. Supplementary data 1 details hydroxychloroquine use in the four French study hospitals.

Discussion

We report a comparative study that uses real world data collected from routine care to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in a population of 181 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 hypoxaemic pneumonia. We found that hydroxychloroquine treatment at 600 mg/day added to standard care was not associated with a reduction of admissions to the intensive care unit or death 21 days after hospital admission compared with standard care alone. Additionally the rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome did not increase. These results were unchanged when the eight patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were included in the analysis, regardless of whether they were analysed in the treatment group (mimicking an as-treated analysis) or in the standard of care (control) group (mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis).

Our population of patients admitted to hospital because they required oxygen is similar to that reported by other studies, and the proportion of patients transferred to the intensive care unit was similar to that reported in a Chinese cohort of 138 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia.18 The clinical features of included patients were also consistent with other reports, with a predominance of men and patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or obesity.1819 Apart from azithromycin, the patients in this study did not receive any other drugs; in particular, potential confounders such as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids, before admission to intensive care.

It could be argued that the timing of antiviral treatment initiation might be critical in reducing SARS-Cov-2 viral load.20 In the recent lopinavir-ritonavir trial, a post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that lopinavir-ritonavir might have a clinical benefit when started earlier than 12 days after symptom onset.21 In our study, however, patients had a short median time from symptom onset to inclusion (seven days) and were treated with hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission. We also found that viral ribonucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 was detectable among all patients at inclusion, showing active viral shedding. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that hydroxychloroquine could be beneficial at symptom onset; this question must be assessed in future trials.

A previous report4 indicates that hydroxychloroquine should have been expected to show some antiviral efficacy. We did not check the results of subsequent SARS-Cov-2 PCR in this study and therefore cannot reach a conclusion about its potential efficacy for decreasing viral shedding. Although this might seem to be a limitation, we used robust clinical outcomes; that is, death, admission to the intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and oxygen requirement, which are substantially more clinically relevant.

Progression of covid-19 pneumonia in the second week of illness is associated with a so called cytokine storm,1922 which is thought to be responsible for the clinical worsening of many patients. Most of the patients included in this study had an inflammatory syndrome defined by a C reactive protein level higher than 40 mg/L, which suggests that a cytokine storm syndrome had already begun.23 Therefore, drugs that decrease virus shedding could be inadequate at this stage, which is why many anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being tested, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids. However, hydroxychloroquine could still be effective in this setting because of its immunomodulatory properties, which include regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 2, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumour necrosis factor α,24 and endosomal inhibition of toll-like receptors, which have a major role in innate immune response.25 Nonetheless, hydroxychloroquine treatment showed no effectiveness in this specific population.

Finally, hydroxychloroquine blocks the KCNH2 encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel and can potentially prolong the corrected QT interval, with potentially severe consequences, such as sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with covid-19.26 In addition to prolongations of corrected QT intervals, we observed two other major cardiac events in this study, and the French national drug agency has reported three deaths potentially related to hydroxychloroquine since its promotion as a potential treatment for covid-19. Although hydroxychloroquine is considered safe in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus, these adverse events might be explained by the use of high dose hydroxychloroquine in patients older than 75 years with renal impairment and frequent drug interactions. We cannot rule out the possibility that these cardiac effects attributed to hydroxychloroquine were caused by covid-19, especially given electrocardiograms were unavailable during follow-up in the control group. However, these possible side effects of hydroxychloroquine plus the negative clinical results of this study argue against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 pneumonia.

Limitations of this study Our study has several limitations. Firstly, although we used robust methods and statistical techniques to draw causal inferences from observational data, treatment was not randomly assigned and potential unmeasured confounders could bias our results. Secondly, four potentially important prognostic variables could not be balanced in the propensity score model because none or only one patient in the treatment group presented with these variables. Accordingly, caution is required in interpreting these results, especially for overall mortality for which only a few events were observed. Nevertheless, this limitation did favour the hydroxychloroquine group and the absence of any difference between treated and untreated patients further strengthens our conclusions. Thirdly, we did not take a centre effect into account in the propensity score model because the number of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in centres was unbalanced (some centres treated all their patients, whereas others did not). Nevertheless, that the decision to treat or not treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus rather than on their characteristics should reduce this bias. Fourthly, our sample was limited to the number of eligible patients available at the time of analysis; we cannot rule out the possibility that our findings are owing to a lack of power. Fifthly, because we included only patients admitted to hospital, we cannot reach a conclusion about the possible efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing covid-19 or in preventing severe forms of the disease. Finally, our study was not designed to assess the efficacy of the association of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and no conclusion about its efficacy can be reached. Further research is ongoing.","                     Skip to main content       Intended for healthcare professionals               Subscribe     My Account   My email alerts     BMA member login    Login      Username *     Password *     Forgot your log in details?

Design Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care. Setting Four French tertiary care centres providing care to patients with covid-19 pneumonia between 12 March and 31 March 2020. Participants 181 patients aged 18-80 years with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia who required oxygen but not intensive care. Interventions Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group). Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission. In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1). Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6). At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment. Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies. However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen. Introduction The World Health Organization declared pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is resulting in fatal pneumonia. Treatments are urgently needed to prevent hypoxaemic respiratory failure and death. 1 Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention after an in vitro study reported its potential activity against SARS-CoV-2, 2 and small studies have released promising results. However, the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19 is the subject of serious debate. 3 One uncontrolled French study included 26 hospital inpatients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on a nasopharyngeal swab. The study suggested that 600 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 shedding and when combined with azithromycin it was more efficacious. 4 However, another uncontrolled French study found no evidence of antiviral clearance with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 patients admitted to hospital. 5 A recent study randomised 62 patients into two parallel groups: a control group and a group receiving hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day for five days). The study reported a shorter time to clinical recovery in the hydroxychloroquine group. 6 However, these patients were not severely ill, the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined, and there was no stratification for comorbidities known to be associated with a poor outcome. 6 Based on the results of these studies and the negligible cost and known safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in treating rheumatic conditions, this drug has been considered to be potentially useful in treating patients with covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine has attracted attention in social and mass media, and has also received US Food and Drug Administration approval for patients with severe covid-19. 7 However, fears have increased about a shortage of this essential treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematus, 8 and questions have been raised about its safety in patients with covid-19. Because of the lack of unbiased data and the urgency of determining the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19, we used observational data collected in a real world setting in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who required oxygen. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of oral hydroxychloroquine at a daily dose of 600 mg on admissions to the intensive care unit or death by any cause. Secondary outcomes included the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in reducing the duration of oxygen requirement. Methods Study design and population We used data collected from routine care to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and who required oxygen. 9 Physicians screened the electronic health records of all patients with covid-19 pneumonia admitted to four French tertiary hospitals between 12 March and 31 March 2020. Patients were eligible for this study if they were aged 18-80 years, had PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (supplementary data 1), and required oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (corresponding to a WHO progression score of 5). Exclusion criteria were the presence of a contraindication to hydroxychloroquine at 600 mg/day (including patients receiving dialysis); hydroxychloroquine treatment started before admission to hospital; treatment with another experimental drug for covid-19 (tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, or remdesivir) within 48 hours after admission; organ failure that required immediate admission to the intensive care unit or continuous care unit; acute respiratory distress syndrome at admission (defined by the need for non-invasive ventilation with provision of continuous positive airway pressure or invasive mechanical ventilation) 10 ; discharge from the intensive care unit to standard care; decision to limit and stop active treatments prescribed at admission; and opposition to data collection by patients or their legal representative. The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, as amended, and received approval by the appropriate IRB, which included an amendment for the extension of follow-up (No 2020_060, Hôpitaux Universitaires Henri-Mondor, AP-HP). Treatment strategies We compared two treatment strategies: starting hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day (treatment group) and no hydroxychloroquine treatment (control group). The dose was chosen after publication of the first study on hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19. 4 Patients in the treatment group could start treatment within a grace period of 48 hours after admission. The decision of whether or not to treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus and the clinicians’ own opinion of its effectiveness. The decision was made before patients were admitted to hospital and so their characteristics played no part. Supplementary data 1 provides additional information about the number of patients in each group in each hospital. Start and end of follow-up The start of follow-up (baseline or time zero) for each patient was the time of admission to hospital. All patients were followed up from baseline until death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up on 24 April 2020, whichever occurred first. Outcomes The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Patients who received hydroxychloroquine had QT prolongation assessed by a 12 lead electrocardiogram and corrected for heart rate by Bazett’s or Fredericia’s formula at the start of treatment and for three to five days after. Statistical analysis An inverse probability of treatment weighting approach was used to balance the differences in baseline variables between treatment groups. 11 12 A non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to estimate each patient’s probability of receiving hydroxychloroquine given their baseline covariates (that is, the propensity score). Variables of the propensity score model were planned and prespecified before outcome analyses. Several variables were included: age, sex, comorbidities (presence of chronic respiratory insufficiency during oxygen treatment, or asthma, cystic fibrosis, or any chronic respiratory disease likely to result in decompensation during a viral infection; heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV); chronic kidney disease; liver cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class B or more; personal history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, or cardiac surgery); insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or diabetic microangiopathy or macroangiopathy; treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, including anticancer chemotherapy; uncontrolled HIV infection or HIV infection with CD4 cell counts <200/µL; or a haematological malignancy); body mass index (≥30 or not); third trimester of pregnancy; treatment by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers 13 ; time since symptom onset; and severity of condition at admission (percentage of lung affected: ≥50% or not; presence of confusion; respiratory frequency; oxygen saturation without oxygen; oxygen flow; systolic blood pressure; and C reactive protein level). All variables included in the propensity score model reflected knowledge available at baseline. Standardised differences were examined to assess balance, with a threshold of 10% designated to indicate clinically meaningful imbalance. 14 Crude survival rates were computed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratios. Inverse probability of treatment weighting estimates of the relative risk were computed for binary outcomes. Outcomes are presented in the total population and in the subgroup of patients with a better prognosis at admission, estimated by a quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 2. 15 16 Our causal contrast of interest was the per protocol effect, and we compared participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission with those who did not receive the drug. Because some patients subsequently received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours, we specified two additional comparisons. Firstly, mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis: all patients eligible for the study were analysed, and those who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the control group. Secondly, mimicking an as-treated analysis: patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were analysed in the treatment group. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Firstly, we conducted a trimmed analysis that was truncated at the region of common support, defined as the overlap between the range of propensity scores in the treatment group and the control group. Patients with propensity scores outside the region of common support were excluded from this analysis. Secondly, to account for time dependent bias, we performed an analysis in which all patients from the control group who reached the primary outcome (transfer to intensive care unit or death) during the grace period were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, given that their observational data were compatible with both groups at the time of the event. 17 Missing baseline variables were handled by multiple imputation by chained equations using the other variables available. All statistical analyses were performed with the R statistical package version 3.6.1 or later (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, https://www.R-project.org/ ). Patient and public involvement Neither patients nor the public were involved in the conception or conduct of the study. Results Among the 181 patients eligible for analysis, 84 received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission, eight received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission, and 89 did not receive hydroxychloroquine ( fig 1 ). To assess a per protocol effect, our main analysis compared the 84 participants who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours (treatment group) with the 89 who did not receive the drug (control group). The median age of patients was 60 years (interquartile range 52-68 years), and 72% were men. Patients in the treatment group had fewer comorbidities, except for liver cirrhosis. The median interval between symptom onset and admission to hospital was 7 days (interquartile range 5-10 days). Overall, initial severity was well balanced between the groups, except for confusion on admission (0 in the treatment group v 6 (7%) in the control group). Azithromycin was administered to 18% of the participants in the treatment group versus 29% in the control group; amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was given to 52% versus 28%, respectively (excluding cointerventions in patients transferred to the intensive care unit; table 1 ). No patients received antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not used as antipyretics in adults in France and are considered to be contraindicated for covid-19) before transfer to the intensive care unit.

After inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied, 15 of the 19 covariates in the planned propensity score had weighted standardised differences below 10%; four covariates (confusion on admission, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), and liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or more)) exceeded the threshold (supplementary data 3). These results were owing to the absence of confusion on admission in the treatment group (compared with six patients with confusion in the control group); only one patient had chronic kidney disease in the treatment group (compared with eight in the control group); only one patient had chronic heart failure in the treatment group (compared with five in the control group); and only one patient had liver cirrhosis in the treatment group (compared with no patients in the control group). These four variables were therefore not included in the final propensity score model (supplementary data 4). Follow-up and outcomes Median follow-up for surviving patients was 32.5 days; three patients (one in the treatment group and two in the control group; 2%) were lost to follow-up after being discharged in good health and without oxygen. Two other patients had a follow-up of only 20 days. At day 21, 17 of 173 (10%) patients had died (nine in the treatment group and eight in the control group). In the non-weighted analyses, among the 173 patients in the two treatment groups, the rate of survival without transfer to intensive care at 21 days was 80% in the treatment group compared with 75% in the control group (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.5; fig 2 ). The overall survival rate at 21 days was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.5 to 3.0). The rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70% in the treatment group and 74% in the control group (1.2, 0.7 to 2.2; table 2 , supplementary data 5 and 6).

Furthermore, 80% of patients in both groups had been discharged to home or rehabilitation (1.0, 0.9 to 1.2; table 2 ). None of the 15 patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was transferred to intensive care and none died. Additionally, these patients had fewer severe signs at admission compared with patients who received hydroxychloroquine without azithromycin (oxygen flow: 2 L/min, interquartile range 1.25-4 v 3 L/min, 2-6; respiratory frequency: 25 per min, interquartile range 22-33 v 28 per min, 24-32; percentage of lung affected >50%: 13% v 17%). Finally, 26 patients received azithromycin without hydroxychloroquine. Among these patients, six were admitted to the intensive care unit and five died. In the inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses that took imbalance at baseline into account, among the 173 patients in the two groups, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1; fig 2 ). The overall survival rate at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). The rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6; table 2 , supplementary data 5 and 6). At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Furthermore, 76% of patients in the treatment group had been discharged to home or rehabilitation compared with 82% in the control group (0.9, 0.8 to 1.2; table 2 ). All sensitivity analyses were consistent with the principal analysis and found that hydroxychloroquine had no effect on any outcome (supplementary data 7). Our results also suggested that patients with fewer symptoms and better prognosis at admission did not respond to hydroxychloroquine (quick sepsis related organ failure assessment score less than 2: n=73 in the treatment group and n=76 in the control group): weighted hazard ratio 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.6) for survival without transfer to intensive care unit; weighted hazard ratio 1.8 (0.6 to 5.9) for overall survival; weighted hazard ratio 1.6 (0.7 to 3.3) for survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome; weighted relative risk 1.0 (0.9 to 1.2) for oxygen weaning; weighted relative risk 0.9 (0.7 to 1.1) for discharge to home or rehabilitation. Finally, adding the eight patients who received hydroxychloroquine treatment more than 48 hours after admission (for a population of 181) and including them in the treatment group (mimicking an as-treated analysis) or in the control group (mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis) did not change the results (weighted hazard ratio 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1), and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.9) for the primary outcome, respectively; supplementary data 8 and 9). Safety Of the 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within the first 48 hours, eight (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine at a median of 4 days (interquartile range 3-9 days) after it began, which is in accordance with French national guidelines. Among these patients, seven had a corrected QT interval prolongation of more than 60 ms (including one patient with corrected QT interval prolongation >500 ms). One patient who received no other drugs that might have interfered with cardiac conduction presented a first degree atrioventricular block after two days of hydroxychloroquine treatment. One patient in whom hydroxychloroquine was started five days after admission (control group) was transferred to intensive care two days later. This patient was then prescribed lopinavir and ritonavir and developed left bundle branch block on day 8. None of these patients was concomitantly treated with azithromycin. Discussion We report a comparative study that uses real world data collected from routine care to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in a population of 181 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 hypoxaemic pneumonia. We found that hydroxychloroquine treatment at 600 mg/day added to standard care was not associated with a reduction of admissions to the intensive care unit or death 21 days after hospital admission compared with standard care alone. Additionally the rate of survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome did not increase. These results were unchanged when the eight patients who received hydroxychloroquine after 48 hours were included in the analysis, regardless of whether they were analysed in the treatment group (mimicking an as-treated analysis) or in the standard of care (control) group (mimicking an intention-to-treat analysis). Our population of patients admitted to hospital because they required oxygen is similar to that reported by other studies, and the proportion of patients transferred to the intensive care unit was similar to that reported in a Chinese cohort of 138 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia. 18 The clinical features of included patients were also consistent with other reports, with a predominance of men and patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or obesity. 18 19 Apart from azithromycin, the patients in this study did not receive any other drugs; in particular, potential confounders such as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids, before admission to intensive care. It could be argued that the timing of antiviral treatment initiation might be critical in reducing SARS-Cov-2 viral load. 20 In the recent lopinavir-ritonavir trial, a post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that lopinavir-ritonavir might have a clinical benefit when started earlier than 12 days after symptom onset. 21 In our study, however, patients had a short median time from symptom onset to inclusion (seven days) and were treated with hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission. We also found that viral ribonucleic acid for SARS-CoV-2 was detectable among all patients at inclusion, showing active viral shedding. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that hydroxychloroquine could be beneficial at symptom onset; this question must be assessed in future trials. A previous report 4 indicates that hydroxychloroquine should have been expected to show some antiviral efficacy. We did not check the results of subsequent SARS-Cov-2 PCR in this study and therefore cannot reach a conclusion about its potential efficacy for decreasing viral shedding. Although this might seem to be a limitation, we used robust clinical outcomes; that is, death, admission to the intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and oxygen requirement, which are substantially more clinically relevant. Progression of covid-19 pneumonia in the second week of illness is associated with a so called cytokine storm, 19 22 which is thought to be responsible for the clinical worsening of many patients. Most of the patients included in this study had an inflammatory syndrome defined by a C reactive protein level higher than 40 mg/L, which suggests that a cytokine storm syndrome had already begun. 23 Therefore, drugs that decrease virus shedding could be inadequate at this stage, which is why many anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being tested, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids. However, hydroxychloroquine could still be effective in this setting because of its immunomodulatory properties, which include regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 2, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumour necrosis factor α, 24 and endosomal inhibition of toll-like receptors, which have a major role in innate immune response. 25 Nonetheless, hydroxychloroquine treatment showed no effectiveness in this specific population. Finally, hydroxychloroquine blocks the KCNH2 encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel and can potentially prolong the corrected QT interval, with potentially severe consequences, such as sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with covid-19. 26 In addition to prolongations of corrected QT intervals, we observed two other major cardiac events in this study, and the French national drug agency has reported three deaths potentially related to hydroxychloroquine since its promotion as a potential treatment for covid-19. Although hydroxychloroquine is considered safe in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus, these adverse events might be explained by the use of high dose hydroxychloroquine in patients older than 75 years with renal impairment and frequent drug interactions. We cannot rule out the possibility that these cardiac effects attributed to hydroxychloroquine were caused by covid-19, especially given electrocardiograms were unavailable during follow-up in the control group. However, these possible side effects of hydroxychloroquine plus the negative clinical results of this study argue against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 pneumonia. Limitations of this study Our study has several limitations. Firstly, although we used robust methods and statistical techniques to draw causal inferences from observational data, treatment was not randomly assigned and potential unmeasured confounders could bias our results. Secondly, four potentially important prognostic variables could not be balanced in the propensity score model because none or only one patient in the treatment group presented with these variables. Accordingly, caution is required in interpreting these results, especially for overall mortality for which only a few events were observed. Nevertheless, this limitation did favour the hydroxychloroquine group and the absence of any difference between treated and untreated patients further strengthens our conclusions. Thirdly, we did not take a centre effect into account in the propensity score model because the number of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in centres was unbalanced (some centres treated all their patients, whereas others did not). Nevertheless, that the decision to treat or not treat patients with hydroxychloroquine was based on local medical consensus rather than on their characteristics should reduce this bias. Fourthly, our sample was limited to the number of eligible patients available at the time of analysis; we cannot rule out the possibility that our findings are owing to a lack of power. Fifthly, because we included only patients admitted to hospital, we cannot reach a conclusion about the possible efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing covid-19 or in preventing severe forms of the disease. Finally, our study was not designed to assess the efficacy of the association of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and no conclusion about its efficacy can be reached. Further research is ongoing. Conclusions In patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen, hydroxychloroquine treatment seemed to have no effect on reducing admissions to intensive care or deaths at day 21 after hospital admission. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine treatment did not have any effect on survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 after hospital admission. These results do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in these patients. What is already known on this topic Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) An in vitro study has reported potential activity by hydroxychloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for covid-19 Small studies of hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with covid-19 have reported promising results What this study adds In patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen, hydroxychloroquine seemed to have no effect on reducing admissions to intensive care or deaths at day 21 after hospital admission Hydroxychloroquine treatment did not have any effect on survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 after hospital admission The results of this study do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in these patients Acknowledgments We thank Ada Clarke, Moez Jallouli, Hicham Kardaoui, Kamil Chitour, Laetitia Languille, Mouhamed Dieng, Jean-Daniel Lelièvre, Chloé Delille, and Louise Mimville.

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/21/australian-researchers-see-virus-design-manipulati/,"A forthcoming Australian scientific study concludes that the coronavirus causing the global pandemic contains unique properties suggesting it was manipulated in a Chinese laboratory and was not the result of a natural occurrence.

Five scientists who conducted the study discovered an unusual ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as the pathogen behind COVID-19 is called, to easily infect humans.

The scientists said there is no sign so far that the virus can be found in other animals, including bats or the exotic wildlife sold for fresh meat at a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified and where China maintains a major laboratory studying such viruses.

The preliminary report of the study, which is now being peer-reviewed, is based on computer modeling of the virus’ ability to infect various animals, including humans. It was published May 13 on the Cornell University website arXiv.org, which is used for discussion of pre-publication papers.

Nikolai Petrovsky, the lead researcher, said his team suspects human manipulation in Wuhan because of the unmatched ability of the virus’ protruding spike to infect human cells.

The virus’ binding strength for human cells “far exceeds” similar properties for infecting other animals, he said in a statement on the forthcoming report.

“This, plus the fact that no corresponding virus has been found to exist in nature, leads to the possibility that COVID-19 is a human-created virus,” said Mr. Petrovsky, a professor at the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.

“It is therefore entirely plausible that the virus was created in the biosecurity facility in Wuhan by selection on cells expressing human ACE2, a laboratory that was known to be cultivating exotic bat coronaviruses at the time.”

ACE2 is the acronym for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is on cell surfaces. The enzyme is the entry point the coronavirus uses to infect organisms and spread.

Human lung cells contain ACE2 receptors that have been shown to be key targets of the SARS-CoV-2.

A laboratory-treated coronavirus also could have escaped the facility through an accidental infection of a staff member who then visited the Wuhan wild animal market, Mr. Petrovsky said. Other potential sources include inappropriate disposal of medical waste at a Wuhan laboratory or transmission from a cat or other animal that came into contact with infected waste.

Mr. Petrovsky said the research team believes the quick evolution of the coronavirus and its unique ability to infect humans are either “a remarkable coincidence or a sign of human intervention.”

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denied again this month that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which houses China’s high-security laboratory studying pathogens, was the source of the outbreak. The head of the Wuhan laboratory has also said she is convinced after a review that her lab played no role in the virus’ spread.

Another Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Zhao Lijian, suggested that the U.S. Army brought the virus to China. President Trump and other top officials angrily denied that accusation.

The Australian study contradicts other scientists’ assertions that there is no evidence the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory or that it is the result of laboratory bioengineering.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key adviser to Mr. Trump on the pandemic, has dismissed any suggestion that the virus came from a Chinese laboratory.

“If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” he told National Geographic this month.

“Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species.”

‘Highly adapted’ pathogen

The forthcoming study, however, concludes that the binding energy of the virus’ “spike” protein — the crownlike protrusions surrounding the surface of the round microbe — is highest for humans and greater than all other species tested, including bats, which have been widely targeted as the likely original source.

“This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly adapted human pathogen,” the Australian report said.

The team analyzed spike protein binding of the virus on a range of other animals, including pangolins, civets, mice, hamsters, cats, dogs, snakes, horses, tigers and cows.

“Overall, the data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is uniquely adapted to infect humans, raising important questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins might lie elsewhere,” the report said.

Jonathan J. Couey, a research assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh, said he agrees with the Australian findings.

“Understanding the exact origin of this virus is vital to ensure that all scientific and medical data are interpreted correctly by policymakers and health care professionals alike,” Mr. Couey said.

However, he said, debate on the laboratory origin of the virus has been stymied by scientists opposed to even considering the possibility.

“Several scientists with obvious conflicts of interest have been permitted to go on the record denying that it would be possible to generate such a virus in a laboratory and stating specifically that the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 would never have been chosen by any ‘gene jockey,’” he said in an email.

“Both of these denials are not genuine scientific rebuttals, but rather semantic pseudo-denials formulated by some of those most closely tied to the funding of these [gain of function] research lines.”

“Gain-of-function research” is laboratory work to increase the ability of pathogens to cause disease. It is carried out to study pandemics and how to respond to them.

U.S. investigation

Research institutions and U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating the origin of the virus, which has now infected nearly 5 million people worldwide and is blamed for at least 323,000 deaths. The 106,000 new cases of infections recorded Tuesday was the most in a single day since the outbreak began, World Health Organization officials said in Geneva.

U.S. intelligence agencies say they agree with a “wide scientific consensus” that the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, according to an April 30 statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. But public and private researchers have said it is impossible to dismiss the possibility of an accidental leak from the Wuhan laboratory of what became the COVID-19 strain.

The spy agencies are studying emerging information and intelligence “to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals, or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” the ODNI said in an unusual public statement.

Knowing the origin of the virus could prove critical to finding vaccines and treatments and responding to future outbreaks, researchers say.

The Australian study is the second scientific paper to suggest laboratory manipulation played a part.

A group of Indian scientists published a paper on Jan. 31 that found the new coronavirus contained four insertions to the spike protein that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not found in other coronaviruses. The features, they said, are similar to those found in the virus known as HIV.

Those scientists concluded that similar structures are “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.”

The Indian paper was withdrawn under pressure from China, but the scientists involved refused to repudiate their research and promised to publish their findings eventually.

Mr. Petrovsky, who is also research director for Vaxine Pty Ltd., a biotechnology company based in Bedford Park, South Australia, said the source of the virus remains a vitally important question.

“While COVID-19 has close similarities to SARS and other bat viruses, no natural virus matching to COVID-19 has been found in nature despite an intensive search to find its origins,” he said. “This raises the very legitimate question of whether the COVID-19 virus might be the result of human intervention.”

Like other scientists who studied the virus, the Australian team did not find easily recognizable artificial gene inserts that would signal virus engineering. Mr. Petrovsky said there are ways to manipulate viruses without such inserts.

For example, laboratory technicians could take a bat coronavirus that is not infectious to humans and force its evolution by culturing the virus with cells that have the human receptor.

That process was used to culture SARS coronaviruses in laboratories.

The result would be that “you can force the bat virus to adapt to infect human cells via mutations in its spike protein,” Mr. Petrovsky said.

Laboratory development of viruses also can create other random mutations.

“The result of these experiments is a virus that is highly virulent in humans but is sufficiently different that it no longer resembles the original bat virus,” he said.

Since those mutations would be acquired randomly in a laboratory, there would be no signature of bioengineering “but this is clearly a virus still created by human intervention.”

The Chinese government initially said the virus appeared to originate in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan but later changed its official version to say the origin is something for scientists to study.

Beijing initially opposed international calls for an investigation into how the disease outbreak began but this week said it would support an independent WHO probe of the handling of the disease outbreak at an unspecified date.

Critics say Chinese secrecy has prevented scientists from learning about the virus.

However, “the nature of this event and its proximity to a high-risk biosecurity facility at the epicenter of the outbreak demands a full and independent international inquiry to ascertain whether a virus of this kind of COVID-19 was being cultured in the facility and might have been accidentally released,” Mr. Petrovsky said.

Here’s The Research That Debunks That Idea Bruce Y. Lee Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Healthcare I am a writer, journalist, professor, systems modeler, computational and digital health expert, avocado-eater, and entrepreneur, not always in that order. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin       Here is a 3D image of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly ... [+] known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). (Image: Getty)   Getty    Don’t you just love conspiracy theories? Especially when two groups of people have pretty much the same conspiracy theory about each other?  Some folks including politicians in both the U.S. and China have suggested that the COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) that’s causing the pandemic may actually be a bioweapon that was manufactured in a lab. The only difference between their conspiracy theories is who’s being accused of doing the manufacturing.  On the one corner are some people in the U.S. who are hinting or in some cases openly claiming that China put together this virus. For example, look at what Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) tweeted out back on January 30:      Most Popular In: Healthcare Man Suffers 4 Hour Erection With Covid-19 Coronavirus Infection Fauci: Covid-19 Vaccine Safety And Effectiveness Should Be Known ‘By Early Winter’ Wearing A Mask Is A Sign Of Mutual Respect During The Coronavirus Pandemic Then, Steve Mosher wrote on February 22 an opinion piece for the New York Post entitled, “ Don’t buy China’s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab .” Take a wild guess at what Mosher wrote about in his piece. By the way, Mosher is not a biomedical scientist, but instead is the president of the Population Research Institute and author of book called Bully of Asia: Why China’s ‘Dream’ Is the New Threat to World Order . So chances are that he didn’t love China in the first place. But who knows, love works in mysterious ways.  So what evidence have Cotton, Mosher, and others provided to support these suggestions or claims? Incriminating pictures? Suspicious emails? Some awkward selfies? Any kind of scientific evidence?   Well, as Cotton picked out, there just happens to be a biosafety level-four (BSL-4) laboratory situated in Wuhan, China, the city where the whole outbreak started. Oh, and the lab had housed some types of coronaviruses among other pathogens. Yep, that’s the evidence.  As you probably know, proximity alone should not imply guilt. That would be like claiming that you farted whenever there’s a bad smell and you happen to be in the vicinity. Sure you may have intestines but that doesn’t mean that every foul stench emanated from your guts.  Plus, it’s a lot easier to leak a pocket of air though your butt than a virus from a BSL-4 facility. BSL-4 facilities maintain the highest level of security among bio-laboratories since they do work on dangerous potentially life-threatening agents such as the Ebola, Lassa fever, and Marburg viruses. So it’s not as if the people inside these labs are playing throw and catch with the viruses and stuffing them into their pockets. To be designated as a BSL-4, the lab has to have the appropriate ventilation systems, reinforced walls, security systems, and construction to keep the wrong things inside and the right things outside.  Is it unusual then to have a BSL-4 facility in a city like Wuhan, China? Not really. There are already at least six BSL-4 facilities in the U.S. in Atlanta, GA, Frederick, MD, Galveston, TX, Hamilton, MT, and San Antonio, TX. According to the Federation of American Scientists website , seven others may be planned, under construction, or possibly finished in various cities such as Boston, MA, and Richmond, VA. These labs in the U.S. also study and house a range of dangerous pathogens. So again having a lab that studies bad pathogens does not mean that the lab released anything.  Not to be outdone, some in China have made similar suggestions, except that it’s the U.S. that built the virus and released it in China. Well, that’s original. For example, take a look at these three tweets from Zhao Lijian, Spokesperson and Deputy Director General, Information Department for the Foreign Ministry of China:           Yes, the claim is that the U.S. released a virus in China so that the U.S. can then eventually suffer the consequences of the spreading virus just a couple months later. Makes a whole lotta sense, except that it doesn’t . Where exactly is the real evidence that the U.S. military created SARS-CoV2?  The back-and-forth dialogue has continued with President Donald Trump then referring to SARS-CoV2 as the “Chinese Virus” as can be seen here:     When questioned why he was using this label rather than the real scientific name of the virus, Trump claimed that it was in response to the claim that the U.S. military had created the virus. The video accompanying the following tweet shows the exchange:     Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth.  So, it looks like conspiracy theorists on both sides haven’t really provided any compelling evidence that SARS-CoV2 was produced in a lab, whether in the U.S., in China, or in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  In fact, there is not only a lack of evidence supporting these conspiracy theories, there has been growing strong scientific evidence against both of them. Scientists, you know the ones who are actually trying to find the truth and solve a problem rather than blame people, have been conducting genetic analyses to determine where the virus came from and how it ended up infecting humans. Although viruses aren’t exactly like people as they don’t seem to have feelings or spread rumors, viruses do have genetic material like people, except their genetic material is not quite as complex as those of humans. Nevertheless, like humans, viruses still pass along such materials when they replicate and evolve. It’s not as simple as The Jerry Springer Show using genetic testing to find out if a guy is someone’s father, but scientists can use more advanced genetic analysis to figure out the origins, the “family tree” of SARS-CoV2.  Indeed, strong clues had already emerged by February 26, 2020, when a Perspectives piece was published in the New England Journal of Medicine . In the piece, David M. Morens, M.D. and Peter Daszak, Ph.D. from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and Jeffery K. Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D. wrote: “Of course, scientists tell us that SARS-CoV-2 did not escape from a jar: RNA sequences closely resemble those of viruses that silently circulate in bats, and epidemiologic information implicates a bat-origin virus infecting unidentified animal species sold in China’s live-animal markets.”  This wasn’t exactly a case of same bat channel, same bat time. But the first, more deadlier SARS virus seemed to cause the 2002-2003 outbreak after it had managed to jump from bats to humans via intermediate hosts such as masked palm civets . Yes, some masked beings may have inadvertently partnered with bats to bring the original SARS virus to humans. So it wouldn’t be too surprising if something like that happened again for SARS-CoV2.        This illustration shows a close-up of the protein spikes on SARS-CoV2. (Image: Getty)   Getty    Even more evidence of a natural rather than human-made origin for SARS-CoV2 has emerged from a study described in a research letter just published in Nature Medicine . In the letter, a research team (Kristian G. Andersen from The Scripps Research Institute, Andrew Rambaut from the University of Edinburgh, W. Ian Lipkin from the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, Edward C. Holmes from The University of Sydney and Robert F. Garry from Tulane University) described how they had analyzed the genetic sequences that code for the protein spikes on the surface of SARS-CoV2. The virus looks sort of like a medieval mace with multiple spikes sticking out from its spherical shape. These spikes aren’t just for show as the virus uses them to latch on to a cell that it wants to invade and then push its way into the cell. Very medieval stuff.  Apparently, portions of these spike proteins are so effective in targeting specific receptors on human cells that it is hard to imagine humans manufacturing them, not with known existing technology. The researchers then concluded that this feature and thus the new coronavirus could have in all likelihood only evolved over time naturally. You see humans can make useful stuff like ride-sharing apps but are still quite puny compared to nature when it comes to making stuff like viruses.  In fact, the research team found that the SARS-CoV-2 structure in general is quite different from what humans would have likely concocted. If a human had wanted to create a viral weapon, he or she would have started with the structure of a virus that’s already known to cause illness in people. Naturally, if you want to make a weapon, you may want to start with something like a grenade launcher rather than a smoothie maker, not that the virus looks like either. Instead, the structure of SARS-CoV2 is quite similar to those of viruses known to infect bats and pangolins.  So all of this further supports the theory that the virus jumped from bats to humans via some intermediate animal host. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus started causing trouble as soon as it started infecting humans. An alternative possibility is that it jumped a longer time ago and hung out among humans for a while before eventually evolving into its current troublesome selves. This latter possibility would be somewhat analogous to inviting someone to live with you because he or she initially seemed relatively harmless but then over time finding out that this flat mate has become a terror.  The findings from the genetic analyses are consistent with how SARS-CoV2 is currently behaving. The virus is not acting like a bio-weapon right now. The best bio-weapons kill at a much higher rate and can be readily transported and released. Imagine being told that a bio-weapon might take the lives of 1% to 3.4% of the people that it infects but you don’t quite know specifically which ones. The difference between SARS-CoV2 and pathogens like the Ebola Virus or anthrax is like the difference between a bunch of sofas and a collection of missiles. Sure, the former can cause harm but not in a predictable and consistent manner. If someone actually decided to develop SARS-CoV2 as a bio-weapon, that person needs to find a new job.  So there you have it: scientific evidence trumping conspiracy theories. Will all of these scientific findings finally quash the “virus-was-made-in-a-lab-and-it-is-your-fault” rhetoric between the politicians and on social media? Probably not. Since when has science stopped such political rhetoric. Maybe, though, it will get more people to focus on the much more important matter at hand: trying to control this pandemic together.

As of Saturday morning 3-21-2020:

** There are 19,775 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US.

** There are 276 deaths blamed on the coronavirus.

** The current mortality rate from confirmed cases is 1.3%

** There are no official numbers that include the number of citizens who had the virus but were not sick enough to seek medical attention.

** There are an estimated 22,000 flu deaths and 36 million cases in the US each year.

On Thursday President Trump announced the breaking news that the US will immediately begin using chloroquine to treat coronavirus.

TRENDING: The Man who Correctly Predicted President Trump's 2016 Win Predicts President Trump has a 91% Chance of Being Reelected in 2020

President Trump called the news of chloroquine’s effectiveness in treating the COVID-19 virus a “game changer.”

This came after three international studies found chloroquine along with Azithromycin was successful in treating the coronavirus.

Dr. Anthony Fauci immediately rebuked President Trump on his claims on chloroquine saying, “There is no magic drug out there right now.”

Dr. Fauci questioned chloroquine as an effective treatment for the coronavirus.

But this should not have surprised the the coronavirus experts.

Back in 2005 the National Institutes of Health published on choloquine’s effectiveness in treating coronavirus in primates!

This was a study on primates that should have been discussed earlier after the virus was identified in China.

Obviously, it was an important study on likely coronavirus treatments.

From the article.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. Results

We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Conclusion

Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.

The study even includes a picture.

Chloroquine has been known to treat coronavirus, at least in primates, since 2005.

Why did it take months for US doctors and international scientists to figure this out?

This is a shocking development.

This post was updated to show chloroquine’s effects on primates.

The drug has been know to treat coronavirus for years.",
https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/,"A nurse holds swabs and a test tube to test people for Covid-19 at a drive-through station set up in the parking lot of the Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.

The current coronavirus disease, Covid-19, has been called a once-in-a-century pandemic. But it may also be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco.

At a time when everyone needs better information, from disease modelers and governments to people quarantined or just social distancing, we lack reliable evidence on how many people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who continue to become infected. Better information is needed to guide decisions and actions of monumental significance and to monitor their impact.

Draconian countermeasures have been adopted in many countries. If the pandemic dissipates — either on its own or because of these measures — short-term extreme social distancing and lockdowns may be bearable. How long, though, should measures like these be continued if the pandemic churns across the globe unabated? How can policymakers tell if they are doing more good than harm?

Vaccines or affordable treatments take many months (or even years) to develop and test properly. Given such timelines, the consequences of long-term lockdowns are entirely unknown.

The data collected so far on how many people are infected and how the epidemic is evolving are utterly unreliable. Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. Three months after the outbreak emerged, most countries, including the U.S., lack the ability to test a large number of people and no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in a representative random sample of the general population.

This evidence fiasco creates tremendous uncertainty about the risk of dying from Covid-19. Reported case fatality rates, like the official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, cause horror — and are meaningless. Patients who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 are disproportionately those with severe symptoms and bad outcomes. As most health systems have limited testing capacity, selection bias may even worsen in the near future.

The one situation where an entire, closed population was tested was the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its quarantine passengers. The case fatality rate there was 1.0%, but this was a largely elderly population, in which the death rate from Covid-19 is much higher.

Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%). It is also possible that some of the passengers who were infected might die later, and that tourists may have different frequencies of chronic diseases — a risk factor for worse outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection — than the general population. Adding these extra sources of uncertainty, reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.

That huge range markedly affects how severe the pandemic is and what should be done. A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza. If that is the true rate, locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.

Could the Covid-19 case fatality rate be that low? No, some say, pointing to the high rate in elderly people. However, even some so-called mild or common-cold-type coronaviruses that have been known for decades can have case fatality rates as high as 8% when they infect elderly people in nursing homes. In fact, such “mild” coronaviruses infect tens of millions of people every year, and account for 3% to 11% of those hospitalized in the U.S. with lower respiratory infections each winter.

These “mild” coronaviruses may be implicated in several thousands of deaths every year worldwide, though the vast majority of them are not documented with precise testing. Instead, they are lost as noise among 60 million deaths from various causes every year.

Although successful surveillance systems have long existed for influenza, the disease is confirmed by a laboratory in a tiny minority of cases. In the U.S., for example, so far this season 1,073,976 specimens have been tested and 222,552 (20.7%) have tested positive for influenza. In the same period, the estimated number of influenza-like illnesses is between 36,000,000 and 51,000,000, with an estimated 22,000 to 55,000 flu deaths.

Note the uncertainty about influenza-like illness deaths: a 2.5-fold range, corresponding to tens of thousands of deaths. Every year, some of these deaths are due to influenza and some to other viruses, like common-cold coronaviruses.

In an autopsy series that tested for respiratory viruses in specimens from 57 elderly persons who died during the 2016 to 2017 influenza season, influenza viruses were detected in 18% of the specimens, while any kind of respiratory virus was found in 47%. In some people who die from viral respiratory pathogens, more than one virus is found upon autopsy and bacteria are often superimposed. A positive test for coronavirus does not mean necessarily that this virus is always primarily responsible for a patient’s demise.

If we assume that case fatality rate among individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 is 0.3% in the general population — a mid-range guess from my Diamond Princess analysis — and that 1% of the U.S. population gets infected (about 3.3 million people), this would translate to about 10,000 deaths. This sounds like a huge number, but it is buried within the noise of the estimate of deaths from “influenza-like illness.” If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with PCR tests, the number of total deaths due to “influenza-like illness” would not seem unusual this year. At most, we might have casually noted that flu this season seems to be a bit worse than average. The media coverage would have been less than for an NBA game between the two most indifferent teams.

Some worry that the 68 deaths from Covid-19 in the U.S. as of March 16 will increase exponentially to 680, 6,800, 68,000, 680,000 … along with similar catastrophic patterns around the globe. Is that a realistic scenario, or bad science fiction? How can we tell at what point such a curve might stop?

The most valuable piece of information for answering those questions would be to know the current prevalence of the infection in a random sample of a population and to repeat this exercise at regular time intervals to estimate the incidence of new infections. Sadly, that’s information we don’t have.

In the absence of data, prepare-for-the-worst reasoning leads to extreme measures of social distancing and lockdowns. Unfortunately, we do not know if these measures work. School closures, for example, may reduce transmission rates. But they may also backfire if children socialize anyhow, if school closure leads children to spend more time with susceptible elderly family members, if children at home disrupt their parents ability to work, and more. School closures may also diminish the chances of developing herd immunity in an age group that is spared serious disease.

This has been the perspective behind the different stance of the United Kingdom keeping schools open, at least until as I write this. In the absence of data on the real course of the epidemic, we don’t know whether this perspective was brilliant or catastrophic.

Flattening the curve to avoid overwhelming the health system is conceptually sound — in theory. A visual that has become viral in media and social media shows how flattening the curve reduces the volume of the epidemic that is above the threshold of what the health system can handle at any moment.

Yet if the health system does become overwhelmed, the majority of the extra deaths may not be due to coronavirus but to other common diseases and conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, trauma, bleeding, and the like that are not adequately treated. If the level of the epidemic does overwhelm the health system and extreme measures have only modest effectiveness, then flattening the curve may make things worse: Instead of being overwhelmed during a short, acute phase, the health system will remain overwhelmed for a more protracted period. That’s another reason we need data about the exact level of the epidemic activity.

One of the bottom lines is that we don’t know how long social distancing measures and lockdowns can be maintained without major consequences to the economy, society, and mental health. Unpredictable evolutions may ensue, including financial crisis, unrest, civil strife, war, and a meltdown of the social fabric. At a minimum, we need unbiased prevalence and incidence data for the evolving infectious load to guide decision-making.

In the most pessimistic scenario, which I do not espouse, if the new coronavirus infects 60% of the global population and 1% of the infected people die, that will translate into more than 40 million deaths globally, matching the 1918 influenza pandemic.

The vast majority of this hecatomb would be people with limited life expectancies. That’s in contrast to 1918, when many young people died.

One can only hope that, much like in 1918, life will continue. Conversely, with lockdowns of months, if not years, life largely stops, short-term and long-term consequences are entirely unknown, and billions, not just millions, of lives may be eventually at stake.

If we decide to jump off the cliff, we need some data to inform us about the rationale of such an action and the chances of landing somewhere safe.

As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making decisions without reliable data    By  John P.A. Ioannidis  March 17, 2020   Reprints                                                    A nurse holds swabs and a test tube to test people for Covid-19 at a drive-through station set up in the parking lot of the Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.  Paul Sancya/AP                                                T he current coronavirus disease, Covid-19, has been called a once-in-a-century pandemic . But it may also be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco.  At a time when everyone needs better information, from disease modelers and governments to people quarantined or just social distancing, we lack reliable evidence on how many people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who continue to become infected. Better information is needed to guide decisions and actions of monumental significance and to monitor their impact.  Draconian countermeasures have been adopted in many countries. If the pandemic dissipates — either on its own or because of these measures — short-term extreme social distancing and lockdowns may be bearable. How long, though, should measures like these be continued if the pandemic churns across the globe unabated? How can policymakers tell if they are doing more good than harm?  advertisement    Vaccines or affordable treatments take many months (or even years) to develop and test properly. Given such timelines, the consequences of long-term lockdowns are entirely unknown.    Related:    We know enough now to act decisively against Covid-19. Social distancing is a good place to start    The data collected so far on how many people are infected and how the epidemic is evolving are utterly unreliable. Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. Three months after the outbreak emerged, most countries, including the U.S., lack the ability to test a large number of people and no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in a representative random sample of the general population.  advertisement    This evidence fiasco creates tremendous uncertainty about the risk of dying from Covid-19. Reported case fatality rates, like the official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, cause horror — and are meaningless. Patients who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 are disproportionately those with severe symptoms and bad outcomes. As most health systems have limited testing capacity, selection bias may even worsen in the near future.  The one situation where an entire, closed population was tested was the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its quarantine passengers. The case fatality rate there was 1.0%, but this was a largely elderly population, in which the death rate from Covid-19 is much higher.  Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%).

It seems most likely.”  If you want to know why then read more of the readers comments and you will see why. The contagion factor is excluded from the authors analysis, which makes his theory just as incomplete as the missing data he complains about.  The contagion factor of this virus is far greater than influenza- so if you don’t take measures to slow the spread you get a higher death rate because you can’t treat all the sick at once. Italy versus China is an actual example of what happens- they are already surpassing China’s death rate even though their population pales in comparison (60 million versus 1.35 billion)         Will  says:     March 19, 2020 at 11:59 am      In the same article that you use the Diamond Princess cruise ship as a case study for fatality rates, you estimate that 1% of the U.S population might be infected. The Diamond Princess cruise ship saw nearly 25% of the ship’s passengers infected. Perhaps multiple your “lost in the noise” 10,000 influenza-like deaths by 20+.         DP  says:     March 19, 2020 at 11:50 am      The author’s choice of influenza and cruise ship results as points of comparison as basis are… just as bad, if not worse, than proceeding with incomplete data.  There is a point to not having the data, but this article is irresponsible and biased against in its assumptions. Stating ‘we don’t know if these measures work’ isn’t completely accurate either, as we see first hand the difference between what happens in some instances as opposed to others (Italy’s death toll will surpass China’s).  For those touting this author’s expertise, know there are others with greater experience indicating otherwise.  The author uses 1918 as a reference, so note Frank Macfarlane Burnet (more knowledgeable about influenza than this author ever will be) indicates the actual death toll from influenza was much higher, and that these viruses can mutate and come in multiple waves- the second wave in 1918 was far deadlier.  This author fails to take that into consideration, as well as the contagion factor. Th fact that COVID19’s viral shed factor is 1,000 times greater than influenza, and it’s peak shed is during incubation when many times there are no symptoms (as opposed to influenza, which peaks after it settles into the lungs).

https://www.dailywire.com/news/stanford-professor-data-indicates-were-overreacting-to-coronavirus,"In an analysis published Tuesday, Stanford’s John P.A. Ioannidis — co-director of the university’s Meta-Research Innovation Center and professor of medicine, biomedical data science, statistics, and epidemiology and population health — suggests that the response to the coronavirus pandemic may be “a fiasco in the making” because we are making seismic decisions based on “utterly unreliable” data. The data we do have, Ioannidis explains, indicates that we are likely severely overreacting.

“The current coronavirus disease, Covid-19, has been called a once-in-a-century pandemic. But it may also be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco,” Ioannidis writes in an opinion piece published by STAT on Tuesday.

“Draconian countermeasures have been adopted in many countries. If the pandemic dissipates — either on its own or because of these measures — short-term extreme social distancing and lockdowns may be bearable,” the statistician writes. “How long, though, should measures like these be continued if the pandemic churns across the globe unabated? How can policymakers tell if they are doing more good than harm?”

The woefully inadequate data we have so far, the meta-research specialist argues, indicates that the extreme measures taken by many countries are likely way out of line and may result in ultimately unnecessary and catastrophic consequences. Due to extremely limited testing, we are likely missing “the vast majority of infections” from COVID-19, he states, thus making reported fatality rates from the World Health Organization “meaningless.”

“Patients who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 are disproportionately those with severe symptoms and bad outcomes,” Ioannidis explains. With very limited testing in many health systems, he suggests, that “selection bias” may only get worse going forward.

Ioannidis then zooms in on the “one situation” where “an entire, closed population was tested”: the Diamond Princess cruise ship’s quarantined passengers. While the fatality rate was 1.0%, he points out, the population was largely elderly, the most at-risk demographic. Projected out onto the age structure of the U.S. population, he calculates, the death rate is more like 0.125%, with a range of 0.025% to 0.625% based on the sample size:

Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%). It is also possible that some of the passengers who were infected might die later, and that tourists may have different frequencies of chronic diseases — a risk factor for worse outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection — than the general population. Adding these extra sources of uncertainty, reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.

“That huge range markedly affects how severe the pandemic is and what should be done,” Ioannidis stresses. “A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza. If that is the true rate, locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.”

For those who argue that the high fatality rate among elderly people indicates that the death rate cannot be as low as 0.05%, the professor notes that “even some so-called mild or common-cold-type coronaviruses that have been known for decades can have case fatality rates as high as 8% when they infect elderly people in nursing homes.” (Read the full opinion piece here.)

https://truepundit.com/cover-up-fauci-approved-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine-15-years-ago-to-treat-nobody-needed-to-die/,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak – caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV – the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.

The Virology Journal – the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health – published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading – get ready for this – “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report…that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”

Dr. Anthony FauciThis means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”

Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.

He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”

The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.

But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.

Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.

On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.

“Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”

Said Dr. Zelenko:

“If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.

All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.”

The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.

While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”

So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died. READ MORE:

Study enrolling Seattle-based healthy adult volunteers.

NIH

A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID’s Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium. The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.

The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.

The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”

Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of March 15, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.

Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.

The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort. The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.

Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits between vaccinations and for additional visits across the span of a year after the second shot. Clinicians will monitor participants for common vaccination symptoms, such as soreness at the injection site or fever as well as any other medical issues. A protocol team will meet regularly to review safety data, and a safety monitoring committee will also periodically review trial data and advise NIAID. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points, which investigators will test in the laboratory to detect and measure the immune response to the experimental vaccine.

“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus,” Dr. Jackson said. “We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007.”

Israeli scientists are on the cusp of developing the first vaccine against the novel coronavirus , according to Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis. If all goes as planned, the vaccine could be ready within a few weeks and available in 90 days, according to a release. (Akunis made his statement at the end of February.)“Congratulations to MIGAL [The Galilee Research Institute] on this exciting breakthrough,” Akunis said. “I am confident there will be further rapid progress, enabling us to provide a needed response to the grave global COVID-19 threat,” Akunis said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.For the past four years, a team of MIGAL scientists has been developing a vaccine against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes a bronchial disease affecting poultry. The effectiveness of the vaccine has been proven in preclinical trials carried out at the Veterinary Institute.MIGAL is located in the Galilee.“Our basic concept was to develop the technology and not specifically a vaccine for this kind or that kind of virus,” said Dr. Chen Katz, MIGAL’s biotechnology group leader. “The scientific framework for the vaccine is based on a new protein expression vector, which forms and secretes a chimeric soluble protein that delivers the viral antigen into mucosal tissues by self-activated endocytosis, causing the body to form antibodies against the virus.”Endocytosis is a cellular process in which substances are brought into a cell by surrounding the material with cell membrane, forming a vesicle containing the ingested material.In preclinical trials, the team demonstrated that the oral vaccination induces high levels of specific anti-IBV antibodies, Katz said.“Let’s call it pure luck,” he said. “We decided to choose coronavirus as a model for our system just as a proof of concept for our technology.”But after scientists sequenced the DNA of the novel coronavirus causing the current worldwide outbreak, the MIGAL researchers examined it and found that the poultry coronavirus has high genetic similarity to the human one, and that it uses the same infection mechanism, which increases the likelihood of achieving an effective human vaccine in a very short period of time, Katz said.“All we need to do is adjust the system to the new sequence,” he said. “We are in the middle of this process, and hopefully in a few weeks we will have the vaccine in our hands. Yes, in a few weeks, if it all works, we would have a vaccine to prevent coronavirus.”MIGAL would be responsible for developing the new vaccine, but it would then have to go through a regulatory process, including clinical trials and large-scale production, Katz said.Akunis said he has instructed his ministry’s director-general to fast-track all approval processes with the goal of bringing the human vaccine to market as quickly as possible.“Given the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development,” MIGAL CEO David Zigdon said. The vaccine could “achieve safety approval in 90 days,” he said.It will be an oral vaccine, making it particularly accessible to the general public, Zigdon said.“We are currently in intensive discussions with potential partners that can help accelerate the in-human trials phase and expedite completion of final-product development and regulatory activities,” he said."," (function (a, d, o, r, i, c, u, p, w, m) {

https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/news/covid-19-vaccine-candidate-shows-promise-first-peer-reviewed-research,"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine scientists announced a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. When tested in mice, the vaccine, delivered through a fingertip-sized patch, produces antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 at quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralizing the virus.

The paper appeared April 2 in eBioMedicine, which is published by The Lancet, and is the first study to be published after critique from fellow scientists at outside institutions that describes a candidate vaccine for COVID-19. The researchers were able to act quickly because they had already laid the groundwork during earlier coronavirus epidemics.

“We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus,” said co-senior author Andrea Gambotto, associate professor of surgery at the Pitt School of Medicine. “That’s why it’s important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from.”

“Our ability to rapidly develop this vaccine was a result of scientists with expertise in diverse areas of research working together with a common goal,” said co-senior author Louis Falo, professor and chair of dermatology at Pitt’s School of Medicine and UPMC.

Compared to the experimental mRNA vaccine candidate that just entered clinical trials, the vaccine described in this paper—which the authors are calling PittCoVacc, short for Pittsburgh CoronaVirus Vaccine—follows a more established approach, using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity. It’s the same way the current flu shots work.

The researchers also used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency. This array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. The patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles—which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces—simply dissolve into the skin.

“We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,” Falo said. “And it’s actually pretty painless—it feels kind of like Velcro.”

The system is also highly scalable. The protein pieces are manufactured by a “cell factory”—layers upon layers of cultured cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein—that can be stacked further to multiply yield. Purifying the protein can also be done at industrial scale. Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mold using a centrifuge. Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it’s needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.

“For most vaccines, you don’t need to address scalability to begin with,” Gambotto said. “But when you try to develop a vaccine quickly against a pandemic that’s the first requirement.”

When tested in mice, PittCoVacc generated a surge of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the microneedle prick.

Those animals haven’t been tracked long term yet, but the researchers point out that mice who got their MERS-CoV vaccine produced a sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the virus for at least a year, and so far the antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals seem to be following the same trend.

Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 microneedle vaccine maintains its potency even after being thoroughly sterilized with gamma radiation—a key step toward making a product that’s suitable for use in humans.

The authors are now in the process of applying for an investigational new drug (IND) approval from the Food and Drug Administration in anticipation of starting a phase I human clinical trial in the next few months.

“Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,” Falo said. “This particular situation is different from anything we’ve ever seen, so we don’t know how long the clinical development process will take. Recently announced revisions to the normal processes suggest we may be able to advance this faster.”

https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-for-30-million-by-september-if-trial-succeeds-says-sharma-11990039,"Plans are in place to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine to 30 million people by September if trials are successful, Business Secretary Alok Sharma has said.

It comes as the UK announced a further 170 deaths of people with coronavirus - the lowest since the day after lockdown began.

Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street news conference, which was delayed due to technical difficulties, the cabinet minister said work by the University of Oxford to find an effective drug was ""progressing well"".

But while pointing out the government had now committed more than a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, Mr Sharma warned there was no certainty one would ever be found.

He said: ""In order to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.

""Last month I announced a new vaccine task force to co-ordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.

""I'm very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts developing a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.""

He added: ""The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well with all phase one participants having received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.

""The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.""

Sophy Ridge On Sunday highlights

The secretary of state also said Imperial College London was ""making good progress"" and would look to move into clinical trials for a vaccine by mid-June, with larger scale trials in October.

So far the government has invested £47m in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes. Mr Sharma announced a further £84m in new funding ""to help accelerate their work"".

He added: ""This new money will help mass-produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.""

He said the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford University with government support, and added: ""This means that if the vaccine is successful AstraZeneca will work to make 30 million doses available by September for the UK as part of an agreement for over 100 million doses in total.""

He said ""the UK will be first to get access"" but that the government would also ensure that ""we're able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost"".

Mr Sharma also announced the UK's first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre is expected to open in summer 2021, a year ahead of plan, after receiving an extra £93m in government cash.

He said: ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months.""

But with no guarantee of a successful vaccine being found, he also stressed the need to look at other drug treatments for those who get the virus.

He reported that six drugs have entered initial live clinical trials, which could be expanded if the results were positive.","   Skip to content           Watch Live     Menu         Home   UK   World   Politics   US   Climate   Science & Tech   Business   Ents & Arts   Travel   Offbeat   Analysis   Opinion   Videos   Weather     More   Home   UK   World   Politics   US   Climate   Science & Tech   Business   Ents & Arts   Travel   Offbeat   Analysis   Opinion   Videos   Weather        Watch Live                        Coronavirus vaccine for 30 million Britons by September if trial succeeds   Work by the University of Oxford to find an effective drug is ""progressing well"" but there are no guarantees, warns a minister.            xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?

https://theconversation.com/we-found-and-tested-47-old-drugs-that-might-treat-the-coronavirus-results-show-promising-leads-and-a-whole-new-way-to-fight-covid-19-136789,"The more researchers know about how the coronavirus attaches, invades and hijacks human cells, the more effective the search for drugs to fight it. That was the idea my colleagues and I hoped to be true when we began building a map of the coronavirus two months ago. The map shows all of the coronavirus proteins and all of the proteins found in the human body that those viral proteins could interact with.

In theory, any intersection on the map between viral and human proteins is a place where drugs could fight the coronavirus. But instead of trying to develop new drugs to work on these points of interaction, we turned to the more than 2,000 unique drugs already approved by the FDA for human use. We believed that somewhere on this long list would be a few drugs or compounds that interact with the very same human proteins as the coronavirus.

We were right.

Our multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, called the QCRG, identified 69 existing drugs and compounds with potential to treat COVID-19. A month ago, we began shipping boxes of these drugs off to Institut Pasteur in Paris and Mount Sinai in New York to see if they do in fact fight the coronavirus.

In the last four weeks, we have tested 47 of these drugs and compounds in the lab against live coronavirus. I’m happy to report we’ve identified some strong treatment leads and identified two separate mechanisms for how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings were published on April 30 in the journal Nature.

The testing process

The map we developed and the FDA drug catalog we screened it against showed that there were potential interactions between the virus, human cells and existing drugs or compounds. But we didn’t know whether the drugs we identified would make a person more resistant to the virus, more susceptible or do anything at all.

To find those answers we needed three things: the drugs, live virus and cells in which to test them. It would be optimal to test the drugs in infected human cells. However, scientists don’t yet know which human cells work best for studying the coronavirus in the laboratory. Instead we used African green monkey cells, which are frequently used in place of human cells to test antiviral drugs. They can be readily infected with the coronavirus and respond to drugs very closely to the way human cells do.

After infecting these monkey cells with live virus, our partners in Paris and New York added the drugs we identified to half and kept the other half as controls. They then measured the amount of virus in the samples and the number of cells that were alive. If the samples with drugs had a lower virus count and more cells alive compared to the control, that would suggest the drugs disrupt viral replication. The teams were also looking to see how toxic the drugs were to the cells.

After sorting through the results of hundreds of experiments using 47 of the predicted drugs, it seems our interaction predictions were correct. Some of the drugs do in fact work to fight the coronavirus, while others make cells more susceptible to infection.

It is incredibly important to remember that these are preliminary findings and have not been tested in people. No one should go out and buy these drugs.

But the results are interesting for two reasons. Not only did we find individual drugs that look promising to fight the coronavirus or may make people more susceptible to it; we know, at a cellular level, why this is happening.

We identified two groups of drugs that affect the virus and they do it two different ways, one of which has never been described.

Disrupting translation

At a basic level, viruses spread by entering a cell, hijacking some of the cell’s machinery and using it to make more copies of the virus. These new viruses then go on to infect other cells. One step of this process involves the cell making new viral proteins out of viral RNA. This is called translation.

When going through the map, we noticed that several viral proteins interacted with human proteins involved in translation and a number of drugs interacted with these proteins. After testing them, we found two compounds that disrupt the translation of the virus.

The two compounds are called ternatin-4 and zotatifin. Both of these are currently used to treat multiple myeloma and seem to fight COVID-19 by binding to and inhibiting proteins in the cell that are needed for translation.

Plitidepsin is a similar molecule to ternatin-4 and is currently undergoing a clinical trial to treat COVID-19. The second drug, zotatifin, hits a different protein involved in translation. We are working with the CEO of the company that produces it to get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.

Sigma receptors

The second group of drugs we identified work in an entirely different way.

Cell receptors are found both inside of and on the surface of all cells. They act like specialized switches. When a specific molecule binds to a specific receptor, this tells a cell to do a specific task. Viruses often use receptors to infect cells.

Our original map identified two promising MV cell receptors for drug treatments, SigmaR1 and SigmaR2. Testing confirmed our suspicions.

We identified seven drugs or molecules that interact with these receptors. Two antipsychotics, haloperidol and melperone, which are used to treat schizophrenia, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two potent antihistamines, clemastine and cloperastine, also displayed antiviral activity, as did the compound PB28 and the female hormone progesterone.

Remember, all these interactions have so far only been observed in monkey cells in petri dishes.

At this time we do not know exactly how the viral proteins manipulate the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. We think the virus uses these receptors to help make copies of itself, so decreasing their activity likely inhibits replication and reduces infection.

Interestingly, a seventh compound – an ingredient commonly found in cough suppressants, called dextromethorphan – does the opposite: Its presence helps the virus. When our partners tested infected cells with this compound, the virus was able to replicate more easily, and more cells died.

This is potentially a very important finding, but, and I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.

All these findings, while exciting, need to undergo clinical trials before the FDA or anyone else should conclude whether to take or stop taking any of these drugs in response to COVID-19. Neither people nor policymakers nor media outlets should panic and jump to conclusions.

Another interesting thing to note is that hydroxychloroquine – the controversial drug that has shown mixed results in treating COVID-19 – also binds to the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. But based on our experiments in both labs, we do not think hydroxychloroquine binds to them efficiently.

Researchers have long known that hydroxychloroquine easily binds to receptors in the heart and can cause damage. Because of these differences in binding tendencies, we don’t think hydroxychloroquine is a reliable treatment. Ongoing clinical trials should soon clarify these unknowns.

Treatment sooner rather than later

Our idea was that by better understanding how the coronavirus and human bodies interact, we could find treatments among the thousands of drugs and compounds that already exist.

Our idea worked. We not only found multiple drugs that might fight SARS-CoV-2, we learned how and why.

But that is not the only thing to be excited about. These same proteins that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect and replicate in human cells and that are targeted by these drugs are also hijacked by related coronaviruses SARS-1 and MERS. So if any of these drugs do work, they will likely be effective against COVID-22, COVID-24 or any future iterations of COVID that may emerge.

Are these promising leads going to have any effect?

The next step is to test these drugs in human trials. We have already started this process and through these trials researchers will examine important factors such as dosage, toxicity and potential beneficial or harmful interactions within the context of COVID-19.

That was the idea my colleagues and I hoped to be true when we began building a map of the coronavirus two months ago. The map shows all of the coronavirus proteins and all of the proteins found in the human body that those viral proteins could interact with.  In theory, any intersection on the map between viral and human proteins is a place where drugs could fight the coronavirus . But instead of trying to develop new drugs to work on these points of interaction, we turned to the more than 2,000 unique drugs already approved by the FDA for human use. We believed that somewhere on this long list would be a few drugs or compounds that interact with the very same human proteins as the coronavirus.  We were right.  Our multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, called the QCRG , identified 69 existing drugs and compounds with potential to treat COVID-19 . A month ago, we began shipping boxes of these drugs off to Institut Pasteur in Paris and Mount Sinai in New York to see if they do in fact fight the coronavirus.  In the last four weeks, we have tested 47 of these drugs and compounds in the lab against live coronavirus. I’m happy to report we’ve identified some strong treatment leads and identified two separate mechanisms for how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings were published on April 30 in the journal Nature.     Every place that a coronavirus protein interacts with a human protein is a potential druggable site.  QBI Coronavirus Research Group , CC BY-ND    The testing process  The map we developed and the FDA drug catalog we screened it against showed that there were potential interactions between the virus, human cells and existing drugs or compounds. But we didn’t know whether the drugs we identified would make a person more resistant to the virus, more susceptible or do anything at all.  To find those answers we needed three things: the drugs, live virus and cells in which to test them. It would be optimal to test the drugs in infected human cells. However, scientists don’t yet know which human cells work best for studying the coronavirus in the laboratory. Instead we used African green monkey cells, which are frequently used in place of human cells to test antiviral drugs. They can be readily infected with the coronavirus and respond to drugs very closely to the way human cells do.  After infecting these monkey cells with live virus, our partners in Paris and New York added the drugs we identified to half and kept the other half as controls. They then measured the amount of virus in the samples and the number of cells that were alive. If the samples with drugs had a lower virus count and more cells alive compared to the control, that would suggest the drugs disrupt viral replication. The teams were also looking to see how toxic the drugs were to the cells.     With dozens of drugs each needing full testing, to get results in four weeks required round-the-clock effort.  Quantitative Biosciences Institute , CC BY-ND    After sorting through the results of hundreds of experiments using 47 of the predicted drugs, it seems our interaction predictions were correct. Some of the drugs do in fact work to fight the coronavirus, while others make cells more susceptible to infection.  It is incredibly important to remember that these are preliminary findings and have not been tested in people. No one should go out and buy these drugs.  But the results are interesting for two reasons. Not only did we find individual drugs that look promising to fight the coronavirus or may make people more susceptible to it; we know, at a cellular level, why this is happening.  We identified two groups of drugs that affect the virus and they do it two different ways, one of which has never been described.  Disrupting translation  At a basic level, viruses spread by entering a cell, hijacking some of the cell’s machinery and using it to make more copies of the virus. These new viruses then go on to infect other cells. One step of this process involves the cell making new viral proteins out of viral RNA. This is called translation.  When going through the map, we noticed that several viral proteins interacted with human proteins involved in translation and a number of drugs interacted with these proteins. After testing them, we found two compounds that disrupt the translation of the virus.  The two compounds are called ternatin-4 and zotatifin . Both of these are currently used to treat multiple myeloma and seem to fight COVID-19 by binding to and inhibiting proteins in the cell that are needed for translation.  Plitidepsin is a similar molecule to ternatin-4 and is currently undergoing a clinical trial to treat COVID-19 . The second drug, zotatifin , hits a different protein involved in translation. We are working with the CEO of the company that produces it to get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.     The coronavirus attacks human cells using dozens of devious tricks.  narvikk/iStock Getty Images Plus via Getty Images    Sigma receptors  The second group of drugs we identified work in an entirely different way.  Cell receptors are found both inside of and on the surface of all cells. They act like specialized switches . When a specific molecule binds to a specific receptor, this tells a cell to do a specific task. Viruses often use receptors to infect cells .  Our original map identified two promising MV cell receptors for drug treatments, SigmaR1 and SigmaR2. Testing confirmed our suspicions.  We identified seven drugs or molecules that interact with these receptors. Two antipsychotics, haloperidol and melperone , which are used to treat schizophrenia, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two potent antihistamines, clemastine and cloperastine , also displayed antiviral activity, as did the compound PB28 and the female hormone progesterone .  Remember, all these interactions have so far only been observed in monkey cells in petri dishes.  At this time we do not know exactly how the viral proteins manipulate the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. We think the virus uses these receptors to help make copies of itself, so decreasing their activity likely inhibits replication and reduces infection.  Interestingly, a seventh compound – an ingredient commonly found in cough suppressants, called dextromethorphan – does the opposite: Its presence helps the virus. When our partners tested infected cells with this compound, the virus was able to replicate more easily, and more cells died.     Laboratory testing is excellent at generating leads but clinical trials must be done to know if these findings translate to the real world.  Quantitative Biosciences Institute , CC BY-ND    This is potentially a very important finding, but, and I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.  All these findings, while exciting, need to undergo clinical trials before the FDA or anyone else should conclude whether to take or stop taking any of these drugs in response to COVID-19. Neither people nor policymakers nor media outlets should panic and jump to conclusions .  Another interesting thing to note is that hydroxychloroquine – the controversial drug that has shown mixed results in treating COVID-19 – also binds to the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. But based on our experiments in both labs, we do not think hydroxychloroquine binds to them efficiently.

https://onenewsnow.com/perspectives/bryan-fischer/2020/04/27/fauci-knew-about-hcq-in-2005-nobody-needed-to-die,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.

The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”

This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”

Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.

He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”

The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.

But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.

Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.

On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.

“Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”

Said Dr. Zelenko:

""If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.

All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.""

The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.

While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”

So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.

This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.

Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.

So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.

Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.

It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?

There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.

Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.","                 CATEGORIES   BUSINESS  CHURCH  CULTURE  EDUCATION  LEGAL-COURTS  MEDIA  MISSIONS  NATIONAL SECURITY  PERSECUTION  POLITICS-GOVT  PRO-LIFE  SCIENCE & TECH  PERSPECTIVES    PODCASTS  APP  SYNDICATION  POLICIES  FAQ  CONTACT US  RSS FEED  DONATE                      CATEGORIES        BUSINESS  CHURCH  CULTURE  EDUCATION  LEGAL-COURTS  MEDIA  MISSIONS  NATIONAL SECURITY  PERSECUTION  POLITICS-GOVT  PRO-LIFE  SCIENCE & TECH  PERSPECTIVES         PODCASTS  APP  SYNDICATION  POLICIES  FAQ  CONTACT US  RSS FEED                  BREAKING   Trump: Economy 'roaring back' after jobs report        BRYAN FISCHER   Fauci knew about HCQ in 2005 -- nobody needed to die    Monday, April 27, 2020  |  Bryan Fischer - Guest Columnist  http://on.fb.me/1pFPvvd           Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.  But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.  Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.  On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.  “Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”  Said Dr. Zelenko :  ""If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.  All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.""  The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.  While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”  So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.  This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.  Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.  So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.  Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.  It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?  There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.  Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.

Study enrolling adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the United States.

NIAID

A clinical trial has begun to evaluate whether the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, given together with the antibiotic azithromycin, can prevent hospitalization and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring the trial, which is being conducted by the NIAID-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). Teva Pharmaceuticals is donating medications for the study.

The Phase 2b trial will enroll approximately 2,000 adults at participating ACTG sites across the United States. Study participants must have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and be experiencing fever, cough and/or shortness of breath. The investigators anticipate that many of those enrolled will be 60 years of age or older or have a comorbidity associated with developing serious complications from COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive short-term treatment with either hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or matching placebos. People living with HIV and pregnant and breastfeeding women also are eligible to participate in the study. The first participant enrolled today in San Diego, California.

“We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Repurposing existing drugs is an attractive option because these medications have undergone extensive testing, allowing them to move quickly into clinical trials and accelerating their potential approval for COVID-19 treatment,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “Although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.”

As of May 13, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 4.17 million cases of and 287,399 deaths from COVID-19 worldwide. In the United States, 1.36 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 82,246 deaths have been reported as of May 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Currently, there are no specific therapeutics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is FDA-approved to prevent and treat malaria, as well as to treat the autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some preliminary reports have suggested that hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with the FDA-approved antibiotic azithromycin, may benefit people with COVID-19. Numerous clinical trials are planned or underway, including a recently launched study supported by NIH’s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluating the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. On March 28, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine and medical-grade chloroquine to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized adolescents and adults with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.

Participants in the ACTG study, called A5395, will receive oral medications to take at home. Those randomly assigned to the experimental treatment group will take 400 milligrams (mg) of hydroxychloroquine twice on the first day and 200 mg twice daily for an additional six days. They also will take 500 mg of azithromycin on the first day and 250 mg daily for an additional four days. The control group will receive equivalent numbers of placebo pills. Neither the participants nor the study team will know who received experimental treatment or placebo until the end of the trial.

Participants will record their symptoms, adherence to treatment, and major events such as hospitalizations in a diary for 20 days. Study staff will follow up with participants by telephone during this period. When possible, participants will come to the clinical research site for an in-person visit at day 20. Additional follow-ups will be conducted by telephone three and six months after treatment starts.

The main objective of the study is to determine whether hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can prevent hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. Additionally, investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the experimental treatment for people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are both considered safe in most people, they can cause side effects ranging from headache and nausea to, rarely, heart rhythm problems that can be life-threatening. Because of the risk of heart problems when hydroxychloroquine is used alone or combined with azithromycin, FDA cautions that use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 should be limited to clinical trials or for treating certain hospitalized patients under EUA so clinicians can monitor patients for adverse effects.

“This study will provide key data to aid responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said ACTG Chair Judith Currier, M.D., of the University of California, Los Angeles. “We are pleased to be able to leverage ACTG’s existing infrastructure for HIV treatment clinical trials to quickly implement this important study.”

The study team is led by Protocol Chair Davey Smith, M.D., of the University of California, San Diego. David Wohl, M.D., of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Kara W. Chew, M.D., and Eric S. Daar, M.D., both of the University of California, Los Angeles, serve as protocol vice-chairs. The trial is expected to enroll quickly given the high incidence of COVID-19, and initial results may be available later this year.

https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-antibody/cheap-antibody-test-sent-for-validation-in-coronavirus-fight-idUKKBN21D1W9,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British company behind a 10-minute coronavirus antibody test, which will cost about a $1, has begun sending prototypes to laboratories for validation, which could be a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic.

Health technology firm Mologic, which created one of the first at-home pregnancy tests, is aiming for the test to be rolled out by as early as June if the trials are successful.

Antibody tests are designed to establish whether people have previously been infected, as opposed to antigen tests which show if someone actually has the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus.

Mologic said assessment and validation of its COVID-19 diagnostic test had begun this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St Georges hospital, and that global partners would also examine the prototypes.

Joe Fitchett, Mologic medical director, said that while many companies were working on virus diagnostics, the aim was to create cheap, widely available tests.

“They must be made available to the vulnerable and most precious in society, in the UK or elsewhere,” he told Reuters.

“I would be really disappointed to see a good test that is shown to work to be sold on Amazon only be used by a tiny proportion of the population.”

GAME-CHANGER

Britain has bought 3.5 million antibody testing kits from different suppliers, and is currently making sure they work before distributing them.

A health official told lawmakers on Wednesday that such test kits would be available within days to be sent to households, perhaps via Amazon, saying that an unnamed prototype was being validated in Oxford this week.

But officials are cautious about the trade-off between producing something as quickly as possible and making sure that the tests work.

Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty later dampened expectations of quick widespread availability for the tests, saying inaccurate tests would be dangerous.

“(The) technology is quite close, and it’s being evaluated this week, but it’s not there... The one thing that’s worse than no test is a bad test,” Whitty said.

“I do not think... that this is something we’ll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week.”

Asked why Britain bought 3.5 million tests which might not work, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “If we are able to find an antibody test which works that could be a game-changer.”

“For that reason you will understand that government is doing everything that it can to seek to find a test which works,” he added.

Mologic, which is based near Bedford, north of London, said that after assessment in Britain, the prototypes would be shipped to validation partners in China, the United States, Malaysia, Spain, Brazil and Senegal.

Fitchett said his company had not received any orders from the UK government and was cautious that other tests may be ready to roll out in Britain in days.

“Where the confusion has been, it has been made to sound like it is confirmed or imminent.

REUTERS/Toby Melville Health technology firm Mologic, which created one of the first at-home pregnancy tests, is aiming for the test to be rolled out by as early as June if the trials are successful. Antibody tests are designed to establish whether people have previously been infected, as opposed to antigen tests which show if someone actually has the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus. Mologic said assessment and validation of its COVID-19 diagnostic test had begun this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St Georges hospital, and that global partners would also examine the prototypes. Joe Fitchett, Mologic medical director, said that while many companies were working on virus diagnostics, the aim was to create cheap, widely available tests. “They must be made available to the vulnerable and most precious in society, in the UK or elsewhere,” he told Reuters. “I would be really disappointed to see a good test that is shown to work to be sold on Amazon only be used by a tiny proportion of the population.” GAME-CHANGER Britain has bought 3.5 million antibody testing kits from different suppliers, and is currently making sure they work before distributing them. A health official told lawmakers on Wednesday that such test kits would be available within days to be sent to households, perhaps via Amazon, saying that an unnamed prototype was being validated in Oxford this week. But officials are cautious about the trade-off between producing something as quickly as possible and making sure that the tests work. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty later dampened expectations of quick widespread availability for the tests, saying inaccurate tests would be dangerous. “(The) technology is quite close, and it’s being evaluated this week, but it’s not there... The one thing that’s worse than no test is a bad test,” Whitty said. “I do not think... that this is something we’ll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week.” Asked why Britain bought 3.5 million tests which might not work, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “If we are able to find an antibody test which works that could be a game-changer.” “For that reason you will understand that government is doing everything that it can to seek to find a test which works,” he added. Mologic, which is based near Bedford, north of London, said that after assessment in Britain, the prototypes would be shipped to validation partners in China, the United States, Malaysia, Spain, Brazil and Senegal. Fitchett said his company had not received any orders from the UK government and was cautious that other tests may be ready to roll out in Britain in days. “Where the confusion has been, it has been made to sound like it is confirmed or imminent. And for me that is very problematic,” he said. “You need to be clear about the validation requirements.” Reporting by Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill, additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by Stephen Addison and Alexandra Hudson Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy Do Not Sell My Personal Information All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days,"Test to be validated this week, then made available to healthcare workers and general public

Millions of 15-minute home coronavirus tests are set to be available on the high street or for Amazon delivery to people self-isolating, according to Public Health England (PHE), in a move that could restore many people’s lives to a semblance of pre-lockdown normality.

Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at PHE, told MPs on the science and technology committee that mass testing in the UK would be possible within days, saying evaluation of the fingerprick tests should be completed this week. The government later took a more cautious line, saying that the tests would not be available so quickly.

The UK government has bought 3.5m tests – which reveal whether someone has had the virus and is therefore thought to have some immunity – and is ordering millions more, it has said.

At the prime minister’s daily press conference on Wednesday, the government’s medical and scientific advisers said they needed to be certain the tests worked before they could be made available.

“The key thing for us to do is evaluate – are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?” said Chris Whitty, chief medical officer. “If they are incredibly accurate, we will work out the quickest way to release them. If they are not accurate, we will not release any of them.”

The tests would, he said, “completely transform what we can do” – but were not as important as the antigen tests which are used to diagnose Covid-19 in sick hospital patients.

Boris Johnson said they would make the antibody tests available when they could. “We will do it as soon as possible,” he said. “We are massively ramping up our testing programme.”

The home test, which looks like a pregnancy test, involves pricking a finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by the device.

“Several million tests have been purchased for use. These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do,” Peacock said. “Once they have been tested this week and the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community.”

Amazon has agreed to carry out distribution and the tests are also set to go on sale in chemist shops.

Quick guide What to do if you have coronavirus symptoms in the UK Show Hide Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.

If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days. If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days. If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible. After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine. If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal. If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.

Staying at home means you should: not go to work, school or public areas

not use public transport or taxis

not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home

not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people. If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.

Asked if they would be available in days rather than weeks or months, Peacock said: “Yes, absolutely.” If there was a charge for them, she thought it would be minimal, she added.

Widespread availability of a fingerprick test that produces results in 10 to 15 minutes would be a game-changer. NHS doctors and nurses with symptoms would know immediately whether they have had Covid-19, enabling them to get back to work sooner.

NHS workers or anyone else would be able to know if they have had the virus and are therefore immune, which means they could resume their normal lives, no longer having to work from home or keep their distance from other people. It is widely thought that having had Covid-19 makes people immune to the disease. There have been cases of apparent reinfection, though they are rare.

The test detects the presence of IgM, an antibody that arises very early on in the infection, and IgG, which is increased in the body’s response to the virus. The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.

The UK is not the only country ordering the antibody tests. “Tests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,” said Peacock.

Amazon had agreed to deliver the home tests, Peacock told the committee. There was no suggestion from her that the Royal Mail might be given the contract.

The antibody home tests are part of a programme of increased testing, she said. The number of nasal swab tests, which are currently being used in hospitals to find out whether very sick patients have Covid-19, will be increased within the next couple of days.

The government has promised that these tests, for current viral infection, will reach 25,000. Last week, the numbers tested topped 8,000 but since then have fallen to a low of 5,522, recovering yesterday to 6,491.

Peacock reiterated that they would get to 25,000 a day. It is understood that a deal has been struck with the pharmaceutical giant Roche to increase the numbers to that level.

Peacock said there were also plans to be able to test up to 100,000 key workers a day. “There is urgent work going on,” she said. A test processing centre that has just been opened in Milton Keynes would allow a much bigger laboratory of these standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests.

The home-based test kits would be the third plank of the testing programme. The fourth was seroprevalence testing – blood tests to establish how widespread the virus was in the country.

A Boots spokesperson said: “We are keen to work with the government to explore opportunities to support Covid-19 testing and to support the NHS in any way we can. However we do not have any type of Covid-19 tests in our stores. Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.”

The CDC stopped publishing anything resembling a complete database of daily test results on February 29. When it resumed publishing test data last week, a page of its website explaining its new COVID Data Tracker said that only viral tests were included in its figures. “These data represent only viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data,” the page said as recently as May 18.

Yesterday, that language was changed. All reference to disaggregating the two different types of tests disappeared. “These data are compiled from a number of sources,” the new version read. The text strongly implied that both types of tests were included in the count, but did not explicitly say so.

The CDC’s data have also become more favorable over the past several days. On Monday, a page on the agency’s website reported that 10.2 million viral tests had been conducted nationwide since the pandemic began, with 15 percent of them—or about 1.5 million—coming back positive. But yesterday, after the CDC changed its terms, it said on the same page that 10.8 million tests of any type had been conducted nationwide. Yet its positive rate had dropped by a percent. On the same day it expanded its terms, the CDC added 630,205 new tests, but it added only 52,429 positive results.

This is what concerns Jha. Because antibody tests are meant to be used on the general population, not just symptomatic people, they will, in most cases, have a lower percent-positive rate than viral tests. So blending viral and antibody tests “will drive down your positive rate in a very dramatic way,” he said.

The absence of clear national guidelines has led to widespread confusion about how testing data should be reported. Pennsylvania reports negative viral and antibody tests in the same metric, a state spokesperson confirmed to us on Wednesday. The state has one of the country’s worst outbreaks, with more than 67,000 positive cases. But it has also slowly improved its testing performance, testing about 8,000 people in a day. Yet right now it is impossible to know how to interpret any of its accumulated results.

Texas, where the rate of new COVID-19 infections has stubbornly refused to fall, is one of the most worrying states (along with Georgia). The Texas Observer first reported last week that the state was lumping its viral and antibody results together. On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott denied that the state was blending the results, but the Dallas Observer reports that it is still doing so.

While the number of tests per day has increased in Texas, climbing to more than 20,000, the combined results mean that the testing data are essentially uninterpretable. It is impossible to know the true percentage of positive viral tests in Texas. It is impossible to know how many of the 718,000 negative results were not meant to diagnose a sick person. The state did not return a request for comment, nor has it produced data describing its antibody or viral results separately. (Some states, following guidelines from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, report antibody-test positives as “probable” COVID-19 cases without including them in their confirmed totals.)

Georgia is in a similar situation. It has also seen its COVID-19 infections plateau amid a surge in testing. Like Texas, it reported more than 20,000 new results on Wednesday, the majority of them negative. But because, according to The Macon Telegraph, it is also blending its viral and antibody results together, its true percent-positive rate is impossible to know.

Pennsylvania, Georgia, Texas, and other states are doing the same.  Alexis C. Madrigal Robinson Meyer   May 21, 2020     Getty / The Atlantic     Link Copied     Editor’s Note:  The Atlantic is making vital coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. Find the collection here .  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conflating the results of two different types of coronavirus tests, distorting several important metrics and providing the country with an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic. We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government’s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country’s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. The agency confirmed to The Atlantic on Wednesday that it is mixing the results of viral and antibody tests, even though the two tests reveal different information and are used for different reasons. This is not merely a technical error. States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points. Several states—including Pennsylvania, the site of one of the country’s largest outbreaks, as well as Texas, Georgia, and Vermont—are blending the data in the same way. Virginia likewise mixed viral and antibody test results until last week, but it reversed course and the governor apologized for the practice after it was covered by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Atlantic . Maine similarly separated its data on Wednesday; Vermont authorities claimed they didn’t even know they were doing this.        The widespread use of the practice means that it remains difficult to know exactly how much the country’s ability to test people who are actively sick with COVID-19 has improved. Read: There’s one big reason the U.S. economy can’t reopen “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Ashish Jha , the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told us when we described what the CDC was doing. “How could the CDC make that mistake? This is a mess.” Viral tests, taken by nose swab or saliva sample, look for direct evidence of a coronavirus infection. They are considered the gold standard for diagnosing someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past. A negative test result means something different for each test. If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now ; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus. (Or they may have been given a false result—antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.) The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting. Read: Pools will test the limits of social distancing Mixing the two tests makes it much harder to understand the meaning of positive tests, and it clouds important information about the U.S. response to the pandemic, Jha said. “The viral testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror. The two tests are totally different signals,” he told us. By combining the two types of results, the CDC has made them both “uninterpretable,” he said. The public-radio station WLRN, in Miami, first reported that the CDC was mixing viral and antibody test results. Pennsylvania’s and Maine’s decisions to mix the two tests have not been previously reported. Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, told us that the inclusion of antibody data in Florida is one reason the CDC has reported hundreds of thousands more tests in Florida than the state government has. The agency hopes to separate the viral and antibody test results in the next few weeks, she said in an email. But until the agency does so, its results will be suspect and difficult to interpret, says William Hanage , an epidemiology professor at Harvard. In addition to misleading the public about the state of affairs, the intermingling “makes the lives of actual epidemiologists tremendously more difficult.”        “Combining a test that is designed to detect current infection with a test that detects infection at some point in the past is just really confusing and muddies the water,” Hanage told us. Read: Why the coronavirus is so confusing The CDC stopped publishing anything resembling a complete database of daily test results on February 29. When it resumed publishing test data last week, a page of its website explaining its new COVID Data Tracker said that only viral tests were included in its figures. “These data represent only viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data,” the page said as recently as May 18 . Yesterday, that language was changed . All reference to disaggregating the two different types of tests disappeared. “These data are compiled from a number of sources,” the new version read. The text strongly implied that both types of tests were included in the count, but did not explicitly say so. The CDC’s data have also become more favorable over the past several days.

(The governor’s office did not return a request for comment.)        These results damage the public’s ability to understand what is happening in any one state. On a national scale, they call the strength of America’s response to the coronavirus into question. The number of tests conducted nationwide each day has more than doubled in the past month, rising from about 147,000 a month ago to more than 413,000 on Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic , which compiles data reported by state and territorial governments. In the past week, the daily number of tests has grown by about 90,000. At the same time, the portion of tests coming back positive has plummeted, from a seven-day average of 10 percent at the month’s start to 6 percent on Wednesday. “The numbers have outstripped what I was expecting,” Jha said. “My sense is people are really surprised that we’ve moved as much as we have in such a short time period. I think we all expected a move and we all expected improvement, but the pace and size of that improvement has been a big surprise.” The intermingling of viral and antibody tests suggests that some of those gains might be illusory. If even a third of the country’s gain in testing has come by expanding antibody tests, not viral tests, then its ability to detect an outbreak is much smaller than it seems. There is no way to ascertain how much of the recent increase in testing is from antibody tests until the most populous states in the country—among them Texas, Georgia, and Pennsylvania—show their residents everything in the data.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests.

A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.

An antibody test might tell you if you had a past infection. An antibody test might not show if you have a current infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19 on a viral or an antibody test, you still should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/coronavirus-no-evidence-that-recovered-patients-are-immune-says-who-1.4238216,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Saturday that there was currently “no evidence” that people who have recovered from coronavirus and have antibodies are protected from a second coronavirus infection.

In a scientific brief, the United Nations agency warned governments against issuing “immunity passports” or “risk-free certificates” to people who have been infected as their accuracy could not be guaranteed.

The practice could actually increase the risks of continued spread as people who have recovered from the illness, also known as Covid-19, may ignore advice about taking standard precautions against the virus, it said.

“Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, could serve as the basis for an ‘immunity passport’ or ‘risk-free certificate’ that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection,” the WHO said.

“There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,” it said.

Chile said last week it would begin handing out “health passports” to people deemed to have recovered from the illness. Once screened to determine if they have developed antibodies to make them immune to the virus, they could immediately rejoin the workforce.

The WHO said it continued to review the evidence on antibody responses to the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Some 2.8 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 196,298 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

Most studies have shown that people who have recovered from infection have antibodies to the virus, the WHO said. However, some of them have very low levels of neutralizing antibodies in their blood, “suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery”, it added.-Reuters","                                                                      Search     Newsletters   Crossword   Notices        My Account        Subscribe      Sign In                           The Irish Times   Fri, Jul 3, 2020                                   The Irish Times  News  Sport  Business  Opinion  Life & Style  Culture  More  Video  Podcasts  Executive Jobs     Search      Subscribe     My Account        Sign In                   News  World   Brexit   UK   Europe   US   Africa   Middle East   Asia-Pacific     All News                     Ireland    Irish News      World    UK    Europe    US    Africa    Middle East    Asia-Pacific      Politics    Election2020    Oireachtas    Poll    Elections      Crime & Law    Social Affairs    Religion & Beliefs      Health    Coronavirus      Education    Student Hub    2nd Level Hub    Parents      Subscriber Only    Brexit    Courts      Environment    Climate Change    Heritage & Habitat      Science    Space      Consumer    Offbeat    Highlights      Specials   Coronavirus   Democratic Primaries   China Cables      Podcasts   Confronting Coronavirus   Inside Politics   World View      Subscriptions   ePaper   Newspaper Archive                                 Coronavirus: No evidence that recovered patients are immune, says WHO  Health agency warns governments against issuing ‘immunity passports’     Sat, Apr 25, 2020, 11:00  Updated: Sat, Apr 25, 2020, 14:55      A medical worker administers a Covid-19 test at a testing site in Berkeley, California.

However, some of them have very low levels of neutralizing antibodies in their blood, “suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery”, it added.-Reuters                                    Topics:   Coronavirus    Un    World Health Organisation        Read More    Ireland’s official coronavirus death toll likely to have been overstated, report finds    Wage subsidy could continue until end of year, says Paschal Donohoe    Coronavirus: Kim Jong Un tells officials to stay alert    Ryanair pilots accept 20% pay cut, airline says    Coronavirus: Doctors ‘concerned’ over child abuse risk during pandemic     Dublin city centre streets to be closed to weekend traffic    Revealed: The secret to flapjacks that don’t fall apart    Public transport operators struggle to enforce face mask rules    Ireland faces 'deep downturn' this year and may not rebound until 2024 if there is a second wave    Keep our money if you must, Ryanair.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763854,"Tests for IgG and IgM antibodies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became available in February 2020. On March 4, 2020, the seventh edition of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Protocol for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was released by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China and added serological diagnostic criteria.1 A previous study of 9 pregnant women and their infants found no maternal-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).2 We applied these new criteria to 6 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 and their infants because serologic criteria would allow more detailed investigation of infection in newborns.

Methods

Clinical records and laboratory results were retrospectively reviewed for 6 pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 16 to March 6, 2020, confirmed based on symptoms, chest computed tomography, and positive RT-PCR results.

Blood samples were collected from the mothers at delivery and neonatal blood and throat swab samples were collected at birth. Quantitative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RT-PCR Kit, BioGerm) was conducted on neonatal serum and throat swabs. Inflammatory cytokines (CBA Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit II, BD Biosciences) were tested on neonatal serum. Maternal and neonatal sera samples were used to test for IgG and IgM antibodies. All tests were performed by 2 researchers (Y.T. and Q.D.), with SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM samples from infants double checked (CLIA assays Kit, YHLO). Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testing followed guidance from the World Health Organization.3 The sensitivity and specificity reported by the manufacturer for IgM are 88.2% and 99.0% respectively, and for IgG are 97.8% and 97.9%.4

This study was approved by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University institutional review board, which waived informed consent for this retrospective study.

Results

All 6 mothers had mild clinical manifestations. All had cesarean deliveries in their third trimester in negative pressure isolation rooms. All mothers wore masks, and all medical staff wore protective suits and double masks. The infants were isolated from their mothers immediately after delivery.

All 6 infants had 1-minute Apgar scores of 8 to 9 and 5-minute Apgar scores of 9 to 10. Neonatal throat swabs and blood samples all had negative RT-PCR test results. All 6 infants had antibodies detected in their serum. Two infants had IgG and IgM concentrations higher than the normal level (<10 AU/mL). One infant had an IgG level of 125.5 and IgM level of 39.6 AU/mL; the second infant, had an IgG level of 113.91 AU/mL and IgM level of 16.25 AU/mL (Table 1). Their mothers also had elevated levels of IgG and IgM (Table 2). Three infants had elevated IgG levels (75.49, 73.19, 51.38 AU/mL) but normal IgM levels; all 3 mothers had elevated IgG and 2 also had elevated IgM levels. Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly increased in all infants. None of the infants presented any symptoms as of March 8, 2020.

Discussion

Among 6 mothers with confirmed COVID-19, SARS-CoV-19 was not detected in the serum or throat swab by RT-PCR in any of their newborns. However, virus-specific antibodies were detected in neonatal blood sera samples. The IgG concentrations were elevated in 5 infants. IgG is passively transferred across the placenta from mother to fetus beginning at the end of the second trimester and reaches high levels at the time of birth.5 However, IgM, which was detected in 2 infants, is not usually transferred from mother to fetus because of its larger macromolecular structure. In a study6 of mothers with SARS, the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS-CoV infection in the third trimester of pregnancy had abnormal weights and pathology. Whether the placentas of women in this study were damaged and abnormal is unknown. Alternatively, IgM could have been produced by the infant if the virus crossed the placenta.

This study is limited by the small sample size, lack of cord blood, amniotic fluid, and breast milk and by incomplete information on the outcome of the infants. These findings are important for understanding the serological characteristics of infants whose mothers are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and further study is necessary.

(NIAID-RML via AP)             By   Sandi Doughton    Seattle Times staff reporter     Testing for the novel coronavirus in the Seattle area will get a huge boost in the coming weeks as a project funded by Bill Gates and his foundation begins offering home-testing kits that will allow people who fear they may be infected to swab their noses and send the samples back for analysis. Results, which should be available in one to two days, will be shared with local health officials who will notify those who test positive. Via online forms, infected people can answer questions about their movements and contacts, making it easier for health officials to locate others who may need to be tested or quarantined, as well as to track the virus’ spread and identify possible hot spots. The goal is to eventually be able to process thousands of tests a day, said Scott Dowell, leader of coronavirus response at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The project is ramping up as quickly as possible, but it’s not clear exactly when it will launch, he added. Among other things, software needs to be upgraded to handle the expected crush of requests, and a detailed questionnaire finalized for people who request tests. “Although there’s a lot to be worked out, this has enormous potential to turn the tide of the epidemic,” Dowell said. While Public Health – Seattle & King County has confirmed 71 cases and 15 deaths as of Saturday,  modeling by Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, estimated on Wednesday that the actual number of cases in the Seattle area was about 600. Unchecked, that could theoretically increase to 12,000 cases – and possibly as many as 30,000 – by the end of March, according to projections from Mike Famulare at the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue. But steps to slow transmission can significantly reduce the number of new infections, underscoring the importance of acting quickly to protect people from the virus. The new effort aims to leverage the formidable resources and expertise of the Gates Foundation, known for fighting disease and epidemics around the globe, to assist local health agencies struggling to keep up with a fast-moving outbreak. The Seattle area has emerged as an epicenter of the new disease, with far more cases and deaths than any other U.S. city.  Advertising      “One of the most important things from our perspective, having watched and worked on this in other parts of the world, is the identification of people who are positive for the virus, so they can be safely isolated and cared for, and the identification of their contacts, who can then be quarantined,” Dowell said. But testing has been limited until now, leaving many people frustrated — and frightened. Last week, a laboratory at UW Medicine got approval to begin processing specimens collected by physicians and other health care providers. The Gates-funded project will reduce the need for sick people to visit a doctor’s office or clinic, lowering the chance of exposing others. The initiative grew out of the Seattle Flu Study , a 2-year-old research project based at the University of Washington to track the spread of infectious diseases like influenza. Funded with $20 million from Bill Gates’ private office, the project recruited thousands of volunteers and sent them self-test kits. The focus has now shifted to the new coronavirus, using similar methods to aid the public-health response. The expanded testing program to deliver kits to the public will be supported by a separate group within the Gates Foundation. When the system is up and running, people in the Seattle area who think they might be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the scientific name for the new coronavirus, can fill out a questionnaire online. If their symptoms are consistent, they can request a test kit, which will be delivered to their home within two hours. The swabs will be collected and delivered to a lab for processing. In the meantime, the Seattle Flu Study itself will be increasing its testing capacity to help public health staff investigating the outbreak understand how coronavirus is moving through the community. The Gates Foundation recently announced it’s committing $5 million for coronavirus response in the Seattle area, and much of that will go for expanded testing and analysis. While the initial focus of the test-kit effort will be on the Seattle area, it could eventually expand statewide – and beyond, Dowell said. Outside of King County, one person has died and more than 30 infections have been confirmed as of Saturday.  Advertising     A major goal of the project is to collect as much information as possible online, which will ease the burden on health officials who are stretched thin and hard-pressed to investigate every new case. Local resources have been focused on Life Care Center , the Kirkland nursing home that accounts for the majority of deaths . “They simply don’t have enough epidemiologists to do the shoe-leather epidemiology, the house-to-house case identification,” Dowell said. The Seattle Flu Study already has contributed greatly to the understanding of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. As the outbreak started in China, the scientific team, co-led by Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious-disease specialist at UW Medicine, quickly developed a genetic test for the virus, similar to one they used for flu. A physician who knew about the work sent in a sample from a teenage patient suspected of having the disease, and the lab was able to identify what was only the second case in the state at that time. The flu-project scientists also did the first genetic analyses of new coronavirus cases in Washington, and will continue that work. Bedford, the computational biologist, used those first genomes to analyze changes in the virus over time and concluded that it had probably started circulating in the state earlier than anyone realized.  Advertising     The Seattle Flu Study has also already been collecting nasal swabs from volunteers for a research study on the new coronavirus. People can still sign up for that study, but they cannot get their individual results yet and home-testing kits are not yet available from the new Gates-funded program. The Seattle Flu Study is led by the Brotman Baty Institute in collaboration with UW Medicine, Fred Hutch and Seattle Children’s hospital. The Gates Foundation has also committed $100 million to the global coronavirus response, with an emphasis on vaccine and drug development and improved testing, treatment and control in vulnerable parts of Africa and South Asia.   Note: This story has been updated to reflect additional information provided by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, distinguishing between the Seattle Flu Study and a new project offering home test kits to the public for the new coronavirus, which will be supported by a separate group in the foundation. The story has also been updated to clarify that projections of a possible 30,000 infections in the Seattle area by the end of March represent the upper end of modeling results for unchecked spread, with 12,000 cases as a more likely number. The researcher who did the modeling is also identified.  (Anika Varty / The Seattle Times) How is this outbreak affecting you? What has changed about your daily life?

https://time.com/5805953/home-covid-19-test-everlywell/,"Everlywell, a home testing company that offers dozens of lab tests to consumers, is adding a COVID-19 test beginning on March 23.

Given the slow roll out of testing for COVID-19 in the U.S., and concerns about spreading the disease, at-home testing could help to diagnose more cases. After initially limiting testing to one provided by the Centers for Disease Control and conducted at state and local public health labs, the Food and Drug Administration allowed certified labs, including commercial lab testing companies, to develop and distribute COVID-19 tests on Feb. 29. Though other private companies have been involved with creating tests for COVID-19, this is the first company to offer its test directly to consumers.

The Austin-based Everlywell offers a range of validated tests for everything from cholesterol levels to fertility and infectious diseases like STDs.

People can order the Everlywell COVID-19 test on the company’s website, after first answering questions about their basic health, symptoms and risk factors for the coronavirus disease. A doctor still needs to prescribe the test, so telemedicine doctors from PWNHealth, a national network of physicians who prescribe diagnostic tests, then reviews these answers to determine if a person qualifies for testing, based on criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, because COVID-19 tests are not plentiful in the U.S., doctors are trying to rule out other respiratory diseases like flu first, and only ordering tests for people with symptoms who also have other risk factors for infection, such as being in close contact with others who have been diagnosed.

Explore TIME’s special issue on the coronavirus pandemic

If the telemedicine doctor decides to prescribe an Everlywell COVID-19 test, the company says it will send the $135 test kit in two days (customers can pay $30 more to receive the kit overnight). The kit comes with a special swab that is long enough to take samples from the back of the nose and throat area, along with instructions for how to seal the swab sample to send it back to the company. People can also provide both spit and sputum samples as backups. (For now, the Food and Drug Administration only validates samples from nasoparyngeal swabs, but companies have applied to test spit and sputum.).

The sample is sent in a pre-paid overnight package, and processed at one of several labs approved by the FDA to perform the test around the country within 72 hours. As with many of the commercially available tests, this one extracts SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, from the sample and then probes for specific genetic signatures of the virus.

The company says it will then send results by text and email, and doctors may advise people to self-isolate until they receive them. If the test is positive, the company also provides a full telemedicine consultation with one of around 200 physicians that is included in the cost of the test. That physician also reports the result as a positive case to the appropriate state health departments, as is required by health authorities.

Everlywell says it is ready to ship 30,000 COVID-19 tests, and plans to expand the number of labs processing the samples. But CEO and founder Julia Cheek says that scaling up the number of testing kits will depend on the availability of swabs for collecting samples. Three major manufacturers make the swabs, but the main producer, it turns out, is a company based in Italy. Because the country is under lockdown, limited supplies from there, as well as the surge in demand as more COVID-19 testing is conducted around the world, are leading to a global shortage of swabs for any lab performing the test. That’s why Everlywell’s first kits will contain only one swab, and Everlywell will limit kits to one per household until the supply of swabs becomes more plentiful.

“We’re working hard to ramp up weekly capacity to test 250,000 Americans,” says Cheek. “Our goal is to continue to refresh capacity but with the global swab shortage we don’t have a confirmed timeline for that yet. Ultimately, she says, the testing kits could be designed for a household so everyone in a family could be tested if needed to know what protective measure they might need to take.

https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-turkey-faulty-chinese-kits-not-use,"The Turkish government has cast aside a sample of Chinese-made coronavirus rapid testing kits after finding out that they gave inaccurate results, a Turkish official confirmed to Middle East Eye on Friday.

""We have received some samples from the company,"" the official said. ""We didn’t find them viable and ordered some other testing kit models from a separate Chinese company.""

The official did not say how many kits were concerned, while noting that they hadn't yet been used with the wider public.

The news comes as Spain revealed on Thursday that it had withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made kits after realising that they had only 30 percent accuracy. A Czech media outlet also reported that up to 80 percent of the 150,000 portable quick tests that China delivered to the republic earlier this month were faulty.

Spanish officials told the media that the testing kits were also manufactured by the same company that had supplied the Turkish government.

""I cannot confirm whether the ones we received are the same as the ones in Spain,"" the Turkish official added.

'We have tried them. They don't work. Spain has made a huge mistake by using them' - Ates Kara, Turkish health ministry special science board on coronavirus

Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca confirmed later on Friday that Turkey had tried some rapid antigen tests arrived from China, but authorities ""weren't happy about them.""

""We didn't release them for public use,"" he said in a televised presser.

Koca also said that Turkey had received a different and viable testing kits that are based on antibodies from China. ""We have 350,000 of them now,"" he said.

A member of the Turkish health ministry special science board on coronavirus said that the batch of testing kits were only 30 to 35 percent accurate.

""We have tried them. They don't work. Spain has made a huge mistake by using them,"" Professor Ates Kara said on CNNTurk.

Kara said Turkey was among three countries able to produce their own real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that can give results in six hours.

Coronavirus toll rises

Also on Friday, Turkey announced 16 new deaths from the disease, bringing the total number to 92. Koca said the total number of confirmed infections had reached 5,698, after 7,533 tests were conducted earlier in the day.

He also said that the special science board advised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to further increase the measures in the country by putting cities in isolation as number of patients in the country has increased 50 percent in a single day.

Meanwhile, around 1,500 foreigners - mainly from Algeria - were taken to a dormitory in northern Turkey after being stranded at Istanbul airport due to the pandemic.

Istanbul Airport operator IGA said on Tuesday that the government had tried to persuade the Algerian government to grant landing rights for the affected flights. Algeria has suspended the flights since 19 March.

Since the virus reached Turkey, the government has unleashed an array of measures aimed at curbing its spread, including closing down schools, universities, cafes, congressional prayers, indefinitely postponing sporting events and suspending flights to many countries.

The Interior Ministry also announced that grocery store and supermarket hours would be limited to between 9am and 9pm, with a maximum of one customer for every 10 square metres of shop space.

Turkish authorities have ordered those aged 65 and above and those with chronic illnesses to stay at home, while most public spaces have been temporarily closed.

Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Friday that intercity bus travel would be restricted beginning on midnight as parks, forests and shores would be closed in the weekends to minimise the contagion.",
https://www.axios.com/cdc-lab-coronavirus-contaminated-6dc9726d-dea3-423f-b5ad-eb7b1e44c2e2.html,"A top federal scientist sounded the alarm about what he feared was contamination in an Atlanta lab where the government made test kits for the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the situation in Atlanta.

Driving the news: The Trump administration has ordered an independent investigation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab, and manufacturing of the virus test kits has been moved, the sources said.

Why it matters: At the time the administration is under scrutiny for its early preparations for the virus, the potential problems at the lab became a top internal priority for some officials. But the Trump administration did not talk publicly about the Food and Drug Administration’s specific concerns about the Atlanta lab.

Senior officials are still not saying exactly what the FDA regulator found at the Atlanta lab.

The CDC lab in Atlanta developed the testing formula for the coronavirus test — which the government says works — and was manufacturing relatively small amounts of testing kits for laboratories around the country. This is where the lab ran into problems, per sources familiar with the situation.

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, in a statement to Axios, that government agencies have already worked together to resolve the problems with the coronavirus tests.

“Upon learning about the test issue from CDC, FDA worked with CDC to determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue,” he said.

“We worked hand in hand with CDC to resolve the issues with manufacturing. FDA has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test that already have and are continuing to be distributed. These tests have passed extensive quality control procedures and will provide the high-level of diagnostic accuracy we need during this coronavirus outbreak.”

The big picture: The FDA says it now has full confidence in the coronavirus diagnostic kit, but a slew of new cases announced over the weekend suggest the virus has spread throughout the country while the U.S. government tested only a narrow subset of the population for it.

The U.S. government had admitted to problems with its diagnostic tests — which have put the U.S. well behind China and South Korea in doing large-scale testing of the American public for the coronavirus.

But the U.S. has now tested more than 3,600 people for the virus, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

The big question: It was not immediately clear if or how possible contamination in the Atlanta lab played a role in delays or problems with testing. Nor was it clear how significant or systemic the contamination concerns may be; whether it was a one-time issue that’s easily resolved, or a broader concern involving protocols, safeguards or leadership.

Behind the scenes: The FDA official who visited the Atlanta lab, Timothy Stenzel, is the director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.

About a week ago, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar was under extreme pressure over the delays in getting coronavirus testing kits to market, Stenzel traveled to Atlanta to help troubleshoot whatever technical problems might have been occurring with the tests.

Stenzel was alarmed by the procedures he witnessed in the Atlanta laboratory and raised concerns with multiple CDC officials, per a source familiar with the situation in Atlanta.

Stenzel is a highly-regarded scientist and diagnostics expert. He was on the ground in Atlanta to deal with technical issues and happened to stumble upon the inappropriate procedures and possible contaminants. He is not a laboratory inspector and thus was not charged with producing an inspection report on the lab conditions.

But he raised the concerns and they have been taken seriously and risen to the highest levels of the U.S. government.

On Thursday afternoon, the concerns about the Atlanta laboratory were raised in a conference call that included senior government officials from multiple agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.

The call’s purpose was to figure out ways to mass produce the testing kits and get them to market quickly.

The Trump administration says it’s now figured out how to get over those hurdles. An HHS spokesperson promised that by the end of this week, “we will have the capacity to test up to 75,000 individuals” for the coronavirus

What's next: The FDA’s manufacturing concerns — which include the possible contamination of testing kits — have also resulted in the Trump administration ordering an independent investigation of the CDC’s Atlanta laboratory, according to senior officials.

“HHS has launched an investigation and is assembling a team of non-CDC scientists to better understand the nature and source of the manufacturing defect in the first batch of COVID-19 test kits that were distributed to state health departments and others,” said an HHS spokesperson.

“HHS/CDC have been transparent with the American people regarding the issue with the manufacturing of the diagnostic and will be transparent with the findings of this investigation.” (But the administration was not transparent about the senior FDA official's concerns about the conditions and procedures in the Atlanta laboratory.)

A senior administration official added that the government also moved the manufacturing of the coronavirus tests out of the Atlanta laboratory of CDC.

The official said that the CDC engaged with a third party contractor on Feb. 20 to help manufacture the testing kits. The official added that the FDA regulator, Stenzel, visited the Atlanta laboratory on Feb. 22.

Between the lines: Until Thursday, the CDC’s guidance was to only test Americans for the coronavirus if they’d recently traveled to China — or had close contact with someone known to have the virus — and were symptomatic.

Under this policy, the CDC initially refused to test a California patient who didn’t fit this criteria but had the coronavirus, although the CDC disputes that it denied doctors’ testing request.

As of Friday, South Korea had tested 65,000 people for the coronavirus; the U.S. had tested only 459, per Science Magazine. China can reportedly conduct up to 1.6 million tests a week.

Although the World Health Organization has sent testing kits to 57 other countries, the U.S. decided to make its own.

There have also been problems with the tests themselves. On Feb. 12, the FDA announced that health labs across the country were having problems validating the CDC's diagnostic test, Science reports in an in-depth account of what went wrong with the tests.

The FDA announced yesterday that public health labs can create their own diagnostic test. Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told Science that he expects that public health labs will be able to do 10,000 tests a day by the end of the week.

https://economicstrategygroup.org/resource/economic-strategy-group-statement-covid19/,"The COVID-19 pandemic is at once threatening American lives, the sustainability of our nation’s health care system, and our economic prosperity. Our paramount concern at this moment should be to slow the spread of this virus and equip our health care system to effectively respond. Saving lives and saving the economy are not in conflict right now; we will hasten the return to robust economic activity by taking steps to stem the spread of the virus and save lives.

Public and private sector actors must work together to provide more tests, more ventilators, more personal protective equipment, and more support for hospitals and health care facilities. Only when we have made progress on these fronts will US businesses and consumers be able to resume normal economic activity without inducing a resurgent spread that leads to even more severe health and economic effects.

We are deeply troubled by the prospect of a sustained recession that would erode the economic livelihood of millions of Americans. While Americans practice social distancing and medical professionals work to save lives, policy makers should put measures in place to support households and businesses through this difficult period. These collective efforts will allow more businesses to get up and running again as soon as possible and minimize the severity of the economic hardship on the American people.

https://theintercept.com/2020/04/09/nyc-coronavirus-deaths-race-economic-divide/,"The death rate from Covid-19 for black and Latino New Yorkers is roughly twice that of white New Yorkers, according to the latest city data. The death rate among Latino New Yorkers is 22.8 for every 100,000 people. Among African Americans, it is 19.8. In contrast, 10.2 of every 100,000 white New Yorkers has died from the new coronavirus.

The numbers, which were released on Wednesday, are based on 63 percent of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in New York City. They are consistent with reporting from Louisiana, Illinois, Milwaukee, and Michigan, as well as preliminary national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which show that black people are dying in greater numbers from the virus. They are also in line with long-established health disparities in New York City, where the poor and people of color tend to die earlier and suffer worse health outcomes.

The new numbers show the virus ravaging the city’s communities of color and spreading along the edges of New York’s vast economic divide. The five ZIP codes with the highest rates of positive tests for the coronavirus — in Corona, Cambria Heights, East Elmhurst, Queens Village, and Jackson Heights — have an average per capita income of $26,708, while residents in the five with the lowest rates — in Lower Manhattan, Tribeca, Battery Park City, and the east side of Midtown — had an average income of $118,166, according to an analysis of New York City data by The Intercept.

While the data is still incomplete and factors contributing to the spread of the coronavirus are not yet fully understood, some experts caution against interpreting the racial disparity as caused by race itself. “It can make sense to point to race as a proxy for other causal factors, such as greater rates of poverty and poorer access to health care,” said Adolph Reed, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. But Reed warned of the danger of “neatly tying up the specific epidemiological factors for coronavirus or other bad health outcomes with the ribbon of race.”

“Insofar as people insist on race as the framework, then it clouds what the causal mechanisms are,” said Reed. Race correlates with poverty, a lack of sick leave, exposure to pollution, jobs that leave employees exposed to the coronavirus, and a need to take subways and buses, which can be a source of exposure.",
https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-to-spend-1-billion-combating-covid-19-spread-economic-impacts-1.4848070,"OTTAWA -- The federal government is putting more than $1 billion into its plan to combat and mitigate the impacts of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a handful of key cabinet ministers announced the ""comprehensive"" coronavirus response package on Parliament Hill on Wednesday, just hours before the World Health Organization declared the situation a pandemic.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the pandemic declaration ""doesn’t change our approach as a country… It just is an affirmation of what we saw coming.""

The government is emphasizing how it is ""well-prepared"" for both the public health threat and economic impacts of the virus.

""The reality is that the number of people affected by the virus keeps climbing. Canada has been fortunate so far… but I know that people across the country are worried,"" Trudeau said Wednesday morning.

""We have a responsibility to make sure that Canada is ready for all scenarios and we take that responsibility extremely seriously.""

The prime minister said that government is prepared to take additional measures as the situation evolves, should businesses begin feeling a ""cash crunch,"" as Trudeau put it, citing the impacts already on Canada's natural resource and tourism sectors.

""We are pulling out all the stops to make sure Canadians stay safe, healthy, and supported,"" Trudeau said. ""We will get through what comes next together.""

The announcement includes three new major spending commitments—a more than ten-fold increase in funding for research, more support for provinces shoring up their regional health authorities and stockpiles in anticipation of a worsened spread of the virus, and waiving the waiting period for employment insurance assistance for workers who are in quarantine.

The government's package encompasses the new economic and health supports, as well as those already underway, totalling $1.101 billion.

Here's how the government is allocating those funds:

Support for provinces and territories: $500 million

Investing in research: $275 million

Immediate and additional public health response, including funding for Indigenous Services Canada: $150 million

Sustained communications and public education: $50 million

Personal protective equipment: $50 million

International assistance: $50 million

A work sharing program: $12 million

Repatriation of Canadians: $7 million

Employment Insurance sickness benefits: $5 million

Initial support to the World Health Organization: $2 million

The prime minister was accompanied by Hajdu, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos at the press conference. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam was also present.

The federal government says its response plan is based on expert guidance around pandemic preparedness, but is also leaning on lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003.

The Liberals say their approach to tackling the virus is focused on: cross-government and cross-institution collaboration, evidence-based decision-making, a proportional response to the level of threat, and flexibility as the situation evolves.

How the funding is being spent

The $500 million being earmarked for the provinces and territories will be going towards ""critical health care system needs"" and to ensure that the premiers are all taking necessary measures to make sure hospitals and health services have enough equipment and staff. ""Financial considerations should not and will not be an obstacle"" in preparing, the government said.

In co-ordination with this the government is also bulk purchasing personal protective equipment including: rubber gloves, surgical masks, respirators, face shields, isolation gowns and coveralls.

For workers, the government will waive the one one-week waiting period for people who are placed in quarantine to receive their employment insurance right away, which is estimated to cost $5 million. As well, the $12 million for a work-sharing plan will help employers who are experiencing a business downturn.

The Liberals are ""exploring additional measures"" such as income support for Canadians who are not eligible for EI sickness benefits.

""No one should have to worry about their job if they have to be quarantined. No employer should feel like they have to lay off a worker because of the virus. We can support you, and we will,"" Trudeau said.

Hajdu said that the intent of the EI changes so far is to allow for Canadians to claim the support “without undue effort on behalf of the person to go out and get a note,” if they have received advice from a public health official to self-isolate.

The communication and public education portion of the government's efforts includes the coronavirus information line, available from 7 a.m. to midnight seven days a week (1-833-784-4397); additional funding for the Public Health Agency of Canada's outreach ""to ensure that Canadians can make informed decisions on how best to protect themselves,"" such as infection prevention and attendance at mass gatherings; and targeted funding to address the particular vulnerability of Indigenous population given the state of infrastructure in some communities.

The travel measures Canada is taking include information and screening at all Canadian borders, regularly updating travel advice and providing 24/7 consular services, and assisting Canadians in being evacuated from coronavirus hotspots. That’s already happened with repatriating Canadians from Wuhan in China, and from two cruise chips. Questions remain about additional help for those currently in places like Iran, where the COVID-19 spread is rampant.

The government says that since early February it has sent 16 tonnes of personal protective equipment to China, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus.

So far, Canada has not closed its borders to travellers.

The Liberals are also considerably increasing the amount of money they are putting into research, earmarking on Wednesday another $248 million on top of the $27 million in research funding already announced by the federal government.

This money will focus on research on the virus being done by 47 teams across the country, aimed at speeding up the creation and testing of measures to combat the outbreak, such as a vaccine and antiviral drugs. This comes in addition to ongoing increases to lab testing capacity and Canada-wide health surveillance.

The special cabinet committee focused on the federal response to COVID-19 will continue to meet, with the focus on rapid decision making as the situation continues to escalate.

Stakeholder, Hill reaction

On his way into a Conservative caucus meeting as the prime minister's announcement was still underway, Conservative MP and finance critic Pierre Poilievre described Trudeau's announcement as ""lots of dollars but few details.""

""It is becoming increasingly clear that the Trudeau government does not have a plan to respond to either the health or economic crisis that Canada now faces,"" he said.

Poilievre also said that his party thinks the government should have had a better plan in place earlier to set up self-quarantine to limit community transmission and ""better screening at points of entry for people coming from high risk areas.""

Later, fellow Conservative MP and health critic Matt Jeneroux said that while this is a first step, the opposition still wants more involvement and access to the high-level government decisions being made around coronavirus.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the plan is still not enough for workers who don’t qualify for EI.

“We need to fund them directly and there’s other countries that have figured that out, I believe Canada must and can solve this by giving direct funds to people so that they can stay home,” Singh said.

The funding package is set to be a key topic of conversation when Trudeau and his federal cabinet meets with the premiers during the first ministers' meeting happening in Ottawa over Thursday evening and on Friday.

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is calling the government's announcement a ""positive and pragmatic approach to the global risks of the spreading virus,"" while the Canadian Labour Congress wants to see additional assurances that workers' jobs will be protected.

	The federal government is putting more than $1 billion into its plan to combat and mitigate the impacts of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a handful of key cabinet ministers announced the ""comprehensive"" coronavirus response package on Parliament Hill on Wednesday, just hours before the World Health Organization declared the situation a pandemic.  Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the pandemic declaration ""doesn’t change our approach as a country… It just is an affirmation of what we saw coming.""    Coronavirus newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox   The government is emphasizing how it is ""well-prepared"" for both the public health threat and economic impacts of the virus.  ""The reality is that the number of people affected by the virus keeps climbing. Canada has been fortunate so far… but I know that people across the country are worried,"" Trudeau said Wednesday morning.  ""We have a responsibility to make sure that Canada is ready for all scenarios and we take that responsibility extremely seriously.""    Keep up with the minority Parliament: Sign up for our Capital Dispatch newsletter   The prime minister said that government is prepared to take additional measures as the situation evolves, should businesses begin feeling a ""cash crunch,"" as Trudeau put it, citing the impacts already on Canada's natural resource and tourism sectors.  ""We are pulling out all the stops to make sure Canadians stay safe, healthy, and supported,"" Trudeau said. ""We will get through what comes next together.""  The announcement includes three new major spending commitments—a more than ten-fold increase in funding for research, more support for provinces shoring up their regional health authorities and stockpiles in anticipation of a worsened spread of the virus, and waiving the waiting period for employment insurance assistance for workers who are in quarantine.  The government's package encompasses the new economic and health supports, as well as those already underway, totalling $1.101 billion.  Here's how the government is allocating those funds:   Support for provinces and territories: $500 million  Investing in research: $275 million  Immediate and additional public health response, including funding for Indigenous Services Canada: $150 million  Sustained communications and public education: $50 million  Personal protective equipment: $50 million  International assistance: $50 million  A work sharing program: $12 million  Repatriation of Canadians: $7 million  Employment Insurance sickness benefits: $5 million  Initial support to the World Health Organization: $2 million   The prime minister was accompanied by Hajdu, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos at the press conference. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam was also present.  The federal government says its response plan is based on expert guidance around pandemic preparedness, but is also leaning on lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003.  The Liberals say their approach to tackling the virus is focused on: cross-government and cross-institution collaboration, evidence-based decision-making, a proportional response to the level of threat, and flexibility as the situation evolves.   How the funding is being spent    Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walks with Chief Medical Officer Theresa Tam and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Chrystia Freeland to a news conference on the coronavirus situation, in Ottawa, Wednesday, March 11, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld  The $500 million being earmarked for the provinces and territories will be going towards ""critical health care system needs"" and to ensure that the premiers are all taking necessary measures to make sure hospitals and health services have enough equipment and staff. ""Financial considerations should not and will not be an obstacle"" in preparing, the government said.  In co-ordination with this the government is also bulk purchasing personal protective equipment including: rubber gloves, surgical masks, respirators, face shields, isolation gowns and coveralls.  For workers, the government will waive the one one-week waiting period for people who are placed in quarantine to receive their employment insurance right away, which is estimated to cost $5 million.

The financial impact of the coronavirus is hitting Americans hard: thirty-three percent of voters have already lost their job, been furloughed, placed on temporary leave, or had hours reduced, with 41 percent of those who’ve lost a job already reporting having trouble covering basic costs.

Black Americans are feeling the worst of the financial crisis with almost half (45 percent) reporting they’ve lost jobs, hours, or been put on leave.","             ⌃                                                         Cart                  0                  Issues    Projects   Memos  Blog   About     Support Our Work       Back   Green New Deal  Homes Guarantee  Justice for All  The Future of the Party  All Issues     Back   Foreign Policy  Green New Deal For Public Housing  Primaries for Progress  A Clean Jumpstart for America  Automatic Voter Registration Now  The New Progressive Agenda Project  Building the Movement  Reports  All Projects     Back   What is Data for Progress?

https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-updates-fda-ftc-warn-infowars-selling-products/story?id=70078277&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"US surpasses half a million coronavirus cases In the U.S., more than 18,000 people have died.

The global novel coronavirus death toll has climbed over 102,000.

The virus has killed more people in the U.S. in a matter of months than those who died in recent years from homicide, according to FBI data.

In the U.S., over 500,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. At least 18,693 people in the U.S. have died.

Worldwide, more than 1.69 million people have been diagnosed since the virus emerged in China in December. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.

Today's biggest developments:

US cases now over half a million

Los Angeles stay-at-home order extended to May 15

Boris Johnson 'at an early stage' of recovery

Here's how the news is developing. All times Eastern. Please refresh this page for updates.

9:25 p.m.: US cases now over 500,000

The U.S. now has half a million confirmed cases of COVID-19, three times more than Spain, the country with the second-most infections.

The country's case total rose to 500,399 on Friday night, the same day the world death toll crossed into six digits.

There have been over 18,000 deaths in the U.S.

4:40 p.m.: Los Angeles stay-at-home order extended to May 15

Los Angeles County's ""safer at home"" order is being extended until at least May 15, officials said Friday.

4:22 p.m.: Antiviral drug may help patients with COVID-19

A small study of the antiviral drug remdesivir showed that it was associated with clinical improvement in 68% of patients with COVID-19, according to a report Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Gilead Sciences, the makers of remdesivir, analyzed patients who received the drug from Jan. 25 through March 7 in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Japan.

Of the 53 patients studied, 36, or 68%, saw clinical improvement in their conditions.

Researchers categorized clinical improvement as a discharge from the hospital or decreased oxygen support. Eight of 53 patients (15%) got worse, according to the study.

3:40 p.m.: Some shops in Italy will be allowed to open next week

In hard-hit Italy -- the nation suffering the most coronavirus fatalities -- the entire country has been on lockdown since March 9.

While the lockdown continues until May 3, some stores -- including stationary shops, bookshops and children clothing stores -- can begin to reopen on April 14, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Friday.

3:15 p.m.: Louisiana 'in a better place today' than this time last week

Despite a slight increase in number of hospitalizations and number of patients on ventilators, Louisiana is ""in a better place today than we were at this time last week,"" Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday.

""It is because of you,"" he said. ""It is because of the people of Louisiana and your compliance with the stay-at-home order.""

Louisiana has over 19,000 people diagnosed with COVID-19. The state has lost 755 lives, including state Rep. Reggie Bagala.

In the wake of data revealing a major racial disparity in COVID-19 deaths, the governor said a Health Equity Task Force will be put in place.

The recently released data showed that while African Americans make up roughly 32% of Louisiana's population, they account for 70% of the deaths in the state.

""We want to make sure that we have better health outcomes on the other side of this pandemic, as well,"" the governor said. ""So we need to answer the question: 'What are the social determinants of health disparity and how do we ensure health equity for all of our citizens?' And this task force will be meeting this charge.""

Edwards said his state has received additional federal funding for continuing testing sites in the state, some of which were scheduled to close as soon as today. Edwards said he still isn't satisfied with the testing within the state and that is another issue the task force will tackle.

""There is no region of our state that isn't currently testing, but we don't believe that we have adequate testing anywhere,"" he said.

2:30 p.m.: Government addressing racial disparity, surgeon general says

Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, cautioned Friday, ""We have not reached the peak.""

“You can see for the first time that in the United States we’re starting to level on the logarithmic phase, like Italy did about a week ago,” Birx said at the White House briefing.

""This gives us great heart,"" she said, adding, ""Everyday we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that.""

As data shows that COVID-19 disproportionately kills people of color, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said the government is ""taking steps now"" to combat the ""alarming"" trend.

The government is working ""on data collection, targeted outreach, and increasing financial employment, education, housing, social and health support so everyone has an equal chance to be healthy,"" Adams said at Friday's briefing.

12:15 p.m.: New York sees fewer ICU admissions for 1st time

In New York, the state hit hardest by the pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is ""cautiously optimistic we are slowing the infection rate.""

The three-day average hospitalization rate is down, and for the first time, New York has registered a negative number of ICU admissions, Cuomo said at his Friday press briefing. There were 17 fewer people in intensive care units statewide than there were previously, Cuomo said.

In New York state, over 160,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 -- that's more than any other state in the U.S. and country in the world.

Over 7,000 people in the state have died.

""The death toll is going up. And I understand the logic to that,"" Cuomo told ""Good Morning America"" anchor Michael Strahan Friday.

As preliminary data showed the largest percentage of coronavirus deaths in New York City was among Hispanics, the governor on Wednesday called for more testing in minority communities.

Hispanics accounted for 34% of COVID-19 deaths though they make up 29% of the population. Twenty-eight percent of those who have died from COVID-19 in NYC have been African-American.

""Are we shocked that the rates are higher in the African-American/Latino community? We shouldn't be, Michael, if we're being honest,"" Cuomo told ""GMA."" ""We know that there's inequality in the health care system. We know that the poorer communities often pay the highest price for these types of emergency situations because they're really just bringing to light that systemic racism and discrimination in the system.""

""Let's learn from this moment,"" Cuomo said. ""It's testing and understanding why the minority community has a higher rate. Is it because they work in public sector jobs and they were essential workers and they didn't have the luxury, Michael, of staying home? And they didn't have the luxury of going to stay at their second house? Or staying with a relative in their home in the suburbs?""

""There has to be some lesson that we take from this,"" he said.

11:40 a.m.: Boris Johnson 'at an early stage' of recovery

Johnson, 55, remains ""in very good spirits,"" the statement added.

“The Prime Minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest,"" a spokesman said. “He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received.""

A spokesman said Friday, ""I am told he was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward.""

Johnson has been hospitalized since Sunday evening due to ""persistent symptoms"" of the novel coronavirus. He was transferred to the intensive care unit on Monday after his condition ""worsened,"" and released from intensive care on Thursday, a spokesperson said.

The U.K. death toll on Friday increased by 980 for a total of 8,958 fatalities.

11:20 a.m.: DOJ investigating conditions at nursing home where more than 30 died

""The federal Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act specifically protects the rights of those confined in state facilities like the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home,"" located in Holyoke, said U.S. attorney Andrew Lelling.

""It would be difficult to overstate our obligation to the health and well-being of elderly and disabled military veterans and, by extension, to their families,"" Lelling said in a statement.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker called for an independent investigation into the Soldiers’ Home. This probe is the first publicly-announced federal investigation of a nursing home since the start of the coronavirus crisis.

""Today we are confronted with a crisis like no other. COVID-19 has disrupted our social and economic order at lightning speed and on a scale that we have not seen in living memory,"" Kristalina Georgieva, IMF managing director, said in a statement Thursday.

Three months ago, the IMF said it expected at least 160 countries would see positive per capita income growth in 2020. As of Thursday, the organization now predicts over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.

""The bleak outlook applies to advanced and developing economies alike. This crisis knows no boundaries. Everybody hurts,"" Georgieva said. ""In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.""

In the U.S., more than 16 million people have filed for unemployment insurance in just three weeks, according to data released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor.

The 2020 World Economic Outlook event is scheduled for Tuesday, April 14.

4:25 a.m.: FDA, FTC send warning to Infowars

The Food and Drug Administration, along with the Federal Trade Commission has sent a notice to Alex Jones' Infowars website to stop selling products it claims can help ""mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19.""

Officials not only warned against selling alleged treatments for coronavirus, but it also asked consumers not to use the products since none are approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19.

Among the items the FDA said the conspiracy theory website was selling include, “Superblue Silver Immune Gargle,” “SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste,” “SuperSilver Wound Dressing Gel” and “Superblue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.” The products were sold on the website and promoted on Infowars videos, the FTC letter said.

The FDA has sent 26 warning letters to companies and organizations claiming to have COVID-19 treatments since March 6. Of those, 14 have been labeled as corrected.

While there are trials running across the world, there is no known treatments or vaccines to cure or prevent COVID-19.

In the U.S., over 500,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. At least 18,693 people in the U.S. have died. Worldwide, more than 1.69 million people have been diagnosed since the virus emerged in China in December.

https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-announces-economic-relief-package-small-businesses-impacted-novel-coronavirus,"LOS ANGELES — Mayor Eric Garcetti today announced an $11 million economic relief package for small businesses impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we’ll do everything possible to help them survive this crisis,” said Mayor Garcetti. “This program will offer the support they urgently need to be in a better position to stay in business, retain employees, and thrive again when we get past this very difficult moment.”

As part of the program, which was approved by the Los Angeles City Council, the Economic and Workforce Development Department will provide $11 million in no-fee microloans of $5,000 to $20,000 — which may be used to cover working capital. Since cash flow is critical at this unprecedented time, the program will offer relaxed underwriting with no credit score minimum, a generous allowance to meet debt service, and a 100% Loan to Value ratio. The interest rate can either be 0% for a term of six months to one year, or 3% to 5% for a term of up to five years.

“Small businesses across the city are already taking a significant hit from this crisis,” said Councilmember Paul Krekorian. “This motion allows these businesses to access loans that can keep them functioning over the next critical weeks and months.”

“As the Chair of the Economic Development Committee, I’m especially concerned for what this public health crisis means for our small businesses, in particular for underserved areas such as in my District,” said Councilmember Curren Price. “It’s important not only to support but also maintain our current businesses. This initiative can go a long way in alleviating the concerns that are weighing heavily on our business community.”

The microloan program is being paired with a Small Business Resilience Toolkit, which is being distributed as a digital guidebook and includes vital information covering Federal, State, County, and City emergency policies and programs impacting small businesses. It also offers strategies for adjusting to the effects that COVID-19 is having on businesses — including ways to keep employees safe, maintain operations at maximum possible capacity, and prepare business continuity plans.

Considering the average revenue of Korean midsized firms of 159.17 billion won, BTS’ impact will be almost 26-fold larger.



The researchers expect BTS to attract an average of 796,000 foreign tourists to Korea every year, about 7.6 percent of the total 10.41 million people who visited the country last year.



Exports of products based on BTS are estimated to reach US$1.117 billion, including US$233.98 million of clothing, US$426.64 million cosmetics and 456.49 million food items -- about 1.17 percent of the nation’s total consumer goods exports every year.



“The group’s economic impact has exceeded Psy and Bae Yong-joon (the first-generation Korean Wave actor who gained huge popularity in Japan in the early 2000s),” said Jeong Min, an analyst at the Hyundai think tank.



“More efforts should be made to maximize the BTS effect in the K-pop sector and other industries overall.”

No Canadian should have to worry about whether they can pay their rent or buy groceries during this difficult time.

That’s why the Liberal government is taking strong action to stabilize our economy, and help those impacted by COVID-19.

Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a plan that will quickly provide $27 billion in direct support to Canadian workers, families, and businesses — and $55 billion to meet the liquidity needs of businesses & households, through tax deferrals to help stabilize our economy.

Combined, that’s $82 billion in support for Canadians at this important moment.

The Liberal government’s COVID-19 economic response plan will put more money in the pockets of parents, people facing unemployment, people who are sick or can’t work, small employers, low and medium income families, and more.

Here’s a quick summary of today’s announcements:

Boosting Canada Child Benefit payments for families New Emergency Response Benefit*

$500 per week for up to 16 weeks for Canadians who lose income due to COVID-19 (More info here) 75% wage subsidy for qualifying businesses through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy

Backdated to March 15 — to support businesses, and help keep Canadian workers on the payroll. For companies whose revenue has decreased by at least 30% due to COVID-19. This subsidy is applicable to the first $58,700 of an employee's salary - which means up to $847 per week** 6-month, interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments Top-up payments for low & modest income Canadians, with the GST credit Extended tax filing deadline to June 1

And taxpayers can defer until Aug. 31 income tax that becomes owing before Sept. 21 Waiving the mandatory 1-week wait-period for EI sickness benefits, for a minimum of 6 months

For those in quarantine/self-isolation Waiving requirement for medical certificates to access EI sickness benefits Helping seniors access retirement savings

For full details, see the Prime Minister’s full news release or the Government of Canada’s backgrounder.

Last week, Justin Trudeau also announced a $1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund. This will provide money to provinces and territories to support our healthcare system & workers, support public health preparedness and research, and help limit the spread of the virus.

Leading pharmaceutical companies have seen their combined market capitalizations increase by more than $50 billion in 2020 as they scramble to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, according to data compiled by finance blog AksjeBloggen.

Gilead Sciences is the frontrunner among six pharma companies, seeing a $15.7 billion gain in market value, helped by its trials of the antiviral medication Remdesivir.

Moderna, one of the companies furthest along in its vaccine development, has seen its market value jump by $15.5 billion amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Major pharmaceutical companies invested in COVID-19 research have seen their market values shoot up by over $50 billion in the first half of 2020, according to data compiled by finance blog AksjeBloggen.

These companies made significant market capitalization gains in the last six months, according to the blog, as their stock prices rallied amid a broad market surge, and a boost for the pharma industry as it seeks coronavirus treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine.

Gilead came out as the top winner in market value and shot to the public spotlight during the pandemic, seeing about a $15.7 billion increase in the period.

By the end of January alone, its market value stood at $79 billion, according to data from MacroTrends.

Less than two months later, the figure jumped by almost 30% to $101 billion.

Gilead's pinnacle position among other pharma companies was aided by trials of its antiviral medication Remdesivir, which was touted as a possible treatment for the Covid-19 disease.

Last week its value stood at about $94 billion, a 20% jump since the start of the year.

Moderna, one of the companies furthest along in its vaccine development, has seen its market value jump by $15.5 billion amid the coronavirus outbreak.

""We do know that Moderna's vaccine is also going to go into phase three clinical trials, probably from the middle of July, and so that vaccine candidate is not far behind,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said last week.

Moderna's market value stood at $22.2 billion last week, up from $6.7 billion at the beginning of January.

On May 18, the company's market capitalization peaked at $28.3 billion as its stock climbed after receiving a financial boost of $483 million from US agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to spur development of a vaccine.

British drugmaker AstraZeneca saw a $12.2 billion increase in market value in the same period.

Last week, the combined value of its shares rose to $142.4 billion from $130.3 billion at the end of January.

On May 13, its value peaked at $145 billion after announcing a collaboration with Oxford University to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

AstraZeneca is perhaps the most advanced in its pursuit of a vaccine, Swaminathan said.

""Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate,"" she told a news conference, according to Reuters.

Market values for Roche, Sanofi, and BioNTech rose by $3.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.8 billion respectively in the first half of the year.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/blackrock-sees-risks-for-us-stocks-in-the-second-half-from-virus-and-politics.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain,"BlackRock's global chief investment strategist said after the market's strong gains, he is more cautious on U.S. stocks into the second half of the year because of risks from fading fiscal stimulus and potential election volatility.

The BlackRock Investment Institute, in its second-half outlook, said it retains equities at neutral, or benchmark weight in portfolios. Within that, it has an overweight on European stocks, underweight on emerging markets and neutral, or more cautious view on U.S. equities. It also favors higher-quality names across the board.

""We entered the year overweight equities and credit. At the very end of February, as the storms gathering around the coronavirus became apparent, we cut those investments back to neutral weight,"" said Mike Pyle, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. But when he returned to an overweight in risk in early April, it was just in credit, an asset class the Fed and other central banks are purchasing.

""The strong policy backstop was going to mean credit assets are going to have a smoother and more resilient ride ... versus equity assets,"" Pyle said.

At the same time, aggressive central bank policies have made Treasurys and other sovereign bonds less attractive because of low and negative interest rates.

Pyle said the call on U.S. stocks is not very negative, just cautious and he expects U.S. equities to perform in line with global markets in the back half of the year, after outperforming.

Stocks sold off in the past week, as investors reacted to a resurgence of the coronavirus in some states and concerns that could hurt the economic recovery. The S&P 500 fell 2.9% for the week to 3,009, and it is now up about 16% for the second quarter, off from a more than 20% gain.

""I would say we are cautious on the U.S. market overall because of the fiscal story, and the remaining challenges around the public health response and what we think is a pretty volatile election season with policy uncertainty on the back of that"" said Pyle. He said the tensions between the U.S. and China could also be a negative, and they are likely to continue regardless of who wins the U.S. election.

Pyle said strong policy responses in March supported the economy and helped U.S. markets rebound. However, Pyle said he is concerned about the future path of fiscal stimulus.

""We're worried about a fiscal cliff in late July around unemployment insurance and support for small businesses,"" he said. Pyle said it is also unclear how much support Congress will be willing to provide for state and local governments.

""I think it's likely we do see congressional action. The question mark: is it going to be enough? Is it going to be composed in the right way to support the economy,"" said Pyle.

""With $2 trillion plus of support fiscally as well as a monetary policy response from the Fed, as we look ahead, our concern is the U.S. runs a risk in the back half of the year of retrenching too quickly on fiscal policy,"" he said.

Pyle said he is concerned about the broader U.S. market facing headwinds, as companies try to recover. ""I would say on the positive side we are still inclined towards tech, still inclined towards parts of health care,"" he said.

European stocks, however, have better prospects because of a strong policy response, and the economy is responding.

""We think that gives a lot of tail winds for Europe to outperform for the second half of the year, relative to broad emerging markets,"" he said. ""While risks remain, it's a much more robust policy framework than we thought two or three months ago,"" he said.

Pyle said there are broader trends that investors need to watch, and they have been accelerated by the coronavirus and the response to it. Deglobalization is one, and the trend should continue.

""Deglobalization we see as a very significant issue on the strategic horizon. We think you are increasingly seeing countries and regions delink their economies from one another, which over time reduces correlations across the economies and reduces correlations for financial markets across those economies,"" he said.

Another is the flow of capital into ESG investments, or strategies that take into consideration a company's environmental, social and governance factors.

""One of the interesting things about 2020, taken as a whole, is that flows into ESG oriented funds, or portfolios has continued to grow even during the period of the drawdowns in March and through the retracement as well,"" he said. ""It's been noteworthy that we've seen historic volatility, but one of the constants has been clients continue to allocate capital into sustainable strategies.""","× LOG IN SIGN UP Keep Me Logged In Skip Navigation SIGN IN Pro Watchlist Make It Select USA INTL Markets Pre-Markets U.S. Markets Europe Markets China Markets Asia Markets World Markets Currencies Cryptocurrency Futures & Commodities Bonds Funds & ETFs Watchlist Business Economy Finance Health & Science Media Real Estate Energy Transportation Industrials Retail Wealth Small Business Investing Invest In You Personal Finance Financial Advisors Trading Nation Options Action ETF Street Buffett Archive Earnings Trader Talk Tech Cybersecurity Enterprise Internet Media Mobile Social Media Venture Capital Tech Guide Politics White House Policy Defense Congress 2020 Elections Europe Politics China Politics Asia Politics World Politics CNBC TV Live Audio Latest Video Top Video CEO Interviews Europe TV Asia TV Digital Originals Menu SEARCH QUOTES Markets Pre-Markets U.S. Markets Europe Markets China Markets Asia Markets World Markets Currencies Cryptocurrency Futures & Commodities Bonds Funds & ETFs Watchlist Business Economy Finance Health & Science Media Real Estate Energy Transportation Industrials Retail Wealth Small Business Investing Invest In You Personal Finance Financial Advisors Trading Nation Options Action ETF Street Buffett Archive Earnings Trader Talk Tech Cybersecurity Enterprise Internet Media Mobile Social Media Venture Capital Tech Guide Politics White House Policy Defense Congress 2020 Elections Europe Politics China Politics Asia Politics World Politics CNBC TV Live Audio Latest Video Top Video CEO Interviews Europe TV Asia TV Digital Originals Menu Market Insider BlackRock sees risks for U.S. stocks in the second half from virus and politics Published Mon, Jun 29 2020 7:15 AM EDT Updated Mon, Jun 29 2020 2:10 PM EDT Patti Domm @in/patti-domm-9224884/ @pattidomm Key Points BlackRock Investment Institute is neutral on U.S. equities, or benchmark weight, going into the second half, after the U.S. market's outperformance since late March.

Leading pharmaceutical companies have seen their combined market capitalizations increase by more than $50 billion in 2020 as they scramble to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, according to data compiled by finance blog AksjeBloggen.

Gilead Sciences is the frontrunner among six pharma companies, seeing a $15.7 billion gain in market value, helped by its trials of the antiviral medication Remdesivir.

Moderna, one of the companies furthest along in its vaccine development, has seen its market value jump by $15.5 billion amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Major pharmaceutical companies invested in COVID-19 research have seen their market values shoot up by over $50 billion in the first half of 2020, according to data compiled by finance blog AksjeBloggen.

These companies made significant market capitalization gains in the last six months, according to the blog, as their stock prices rallied amid a broad market surge, and a boost for the pharma industry as it seeks coronavirus treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine.

Gilead came out as the top winner in market value and shot to the public spotlight during the pandemic, seeing about a $15.7 billion increase in the period.

By the end of January alone, its market value stood at $79 billion, according to data from MacroTrends.

Less than two months later, the figure jumped by almost 30% to $101 billion.

Gilead's pinnacle position among other pharma companies was aided by trials of its antiviral medication Remdesivir, which was touted as a possible treatment for the Covid-19 disease.

Last week its value stood at about $94 billion, a 20% jump since the start of the year.

Moderna, one of the companies furthest along in its vaccine development, has seen its market value jump by $15.5 billion amid the coronavirus outbreak.

""We do know that Moderna's vaccine is also going to go into phase three clinical trials, probably from the middle of July, and so that vaccine candidate is not far behind,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said last week.

Moderna's market value stood at $22.2 billion last week, up from $6.7 billion at the beginning of January.

On May 18, the company's market capitalization peaked at $28.3 billion as its stock climbed after receiving a financial boost of $483 million from US agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to spur development of a vaccine.

British drugmaker AstraZeneca saw a $12.2 billion increase in market value in the same period.

Last week, the combined value of its shares rose to $142.4 billion from $130.3 billion at the end of January.

On May 13, its value peaked at $145 billion after announcing a collaboration with Oxford University to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

AstraZeneca is perhaps the most advanced in its pursuit of a vaccine, Swaminathan said.

""Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate,"" she told a news conference, according to Reuters.

Market values for Roche, Sanofi, and BioNTech rose by $3.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.8 billion respectively in the first half of the year.

Between the lines: Some of these drugs are directly related to the pandemic. And the hikes occurred against the backdrop of economic calamity hitting many American families.

The average price increase was 23.8%.

By the numbers: 61 of the drugs with price hikes were being used to treat the coronavirus, while another 30 were undergoing clinical trials for use against it.

Some of the drugs — like those used to sedate ventilated patients — saw both a surge in demand and an increase in price.

""Although some price hikes may be attributable to interruptions in global manufacturing supply chains, others can be attributed to opportunistic hikes in the face of steep increases in demand,"" the authors write.

Another 118 drugs that saw price increases are used to manage chronic conditions.

These patients are generally more vulnerable to severe coronavirus infections, and thus may be facing harder decisions about returning to work.

Susie Lee trust made favorable stock trades before COVID-19

Las Vegas Review-Journal

Rory Appleton

A trust belonging to Nevada Rep. Susie Lee and her husband, Full House Resorts CEO Dan Lee, made several favorable stock trades as Congress underwent early briefings on the coronavirus pandemic in late January, financial disclosures filed by the congresswoman show. …

On Jan. 29, DSL Living Trust sold part of between $1,001-15,000 worth of stock in Graphic Packaging Holding Company, a sustainable paper packaging manufacturer, and between $2,002-30,000 in shares of Targa Resources Inc., a natural gas company.

The trust also purchased between $2,002-30,000 in Grocery Outlet stock on Jan. 28 and Jan. 30.

Early congressional briefings on the pandemic ran from Jan. 24, when the Senate met with top officials, to Jan. 29, when the House did the same. …

Gas and oil have been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, while grocery store sales surged as worried customers began to stock up.

Targa’s stock fell from $38.05 per share on Jan. 29 to a March 18 low of $4.73 before climbing back to $18.18 as of Friday. Graphic Packaging fell from $16.08 on Jan. 29 to $10.57 in March and $13.30 as of Friday.

Grocery Outlet’s stock price has risen from $32.61 on Jan. 30 to $39.40 as of Friday.

Lee’s trust continued to make similar sales and purchases in the days leading up to the Feb. 20 market crash.

These included a Feb. 5 partial sale of $1,001-15,000 worth of Nexstar Media Group, Inc. stock, which fell from $125.09 per share on Feb. 5 to March 23 low of $46.26. The price is currently $79.57. Nexstar owns Las Vegas CBS affiliate KLAS-TV, Channel 8.

Lee was not included in a Campaign Legal Center analysis that found 12 senators and 37 House representatives traded stock between Feb. 2 and April 8.

The Department of Justice is investigating whether Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., committed insider trading after allegedly selling between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stock on Feb. 13⁠, one week before the stock market crashed.

Three other senators were also investigated, but no charges were filed.

The LVRJ reports this weekend that following closed-door briefings to Members of Congress on coronavirus, Congresswoman Susie Lee “made several favorable stock trades,” and that “Lee’s trust continued to make similar sales and purchases in the days leading up to the Feb. 20 market crash.”  The eye-popping report raises new questions after reports surfaced in recent weeks about Lee’s unethical efforts to help her husband secure millions of dollars from the coronavirus relief programs for his out-of-state business interests.  In case you missed it…  Susie Lee trust made favorable stock trades before COVID-19  Las Vegas Review-Journal  Rory Appleton  June 26th, 2020  https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/susie-lee-trust-made-favorable-stock-trades-before-covid-19-2062387/  A trust belonging to Nevada Rep. Susie Lee and her husband, Full House Resorts CEO Dan Lee, made several favorable stock trades as Congress underwent early briefings on the coronavirus pandemic in late January, financial disclosures filed by the congresswoman show. …  On Jan. 29, DSL Living Trust sold part of between $1,001-15,000 worth of stock in Graphic Packaging Holding Company, a sustainable paper packaging manufacturer, and between $2,002-30,000 in shares of Targa Resources Inc., a natural gas company.  The trust also purchased between $2,002-30,000 in Grocery Outlet stock on Jan. 28 and Jan. 30.  Early congressional briefings on the pandemic ran from Jan. 24, when the Senate met with top officials, to Jan. 29, when the House did the same. …  Gas and oil have been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, while grocery store sales surged as worried customers began to stock up.  Targa’s stock fell from $38.05 per share on Jan. 29 to a March 18 low of $4.73 before climbing back to $18.18 as of Friday. Graphic Packaging fell from $16.08 on Jan. 29 to $10.57 in March and $13.30 as of Friday.  Grocery Outlet’s stock price has risen from $32.61 on Jan. 30 to $39.40 as of Friday.  Lee’s trust continued to make similar sales and purchases in the days leading up to the Feb. 20 market crash.  These included a Feb. 5 partial sale of $1,001-15,000 worth of Nexstar Media Group, Inc. stock, which fell from $125.09 per share on Feb. 5 to March 23 low of $46.26. The price is currently $79.57. Nexstar owns Las Vegas CBS affiliate KLAS-TV, Channel 8.  Lee was not included in a Campaign Legal Center analysis that found 12 senators and 37 House representatives traded stock between Feb. 2 and April 8.  The Department of Justice is investigating whether Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., committed insider trading after allegedly selling between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stock on Feb. 13⁠, one week before the stock market crashed.

Had you invested $1,000 in Spotify in the midst of market-zapping pandemic uncertainty in March, you’d have more than doubled your money.

Last Thursday, Spotify’s market cap soared to an all-time high of $49.7 billion — well above what shares traded at when it went public two years ago.

At first glance, Spotify’s rapid share boom appears excellent news for the commercial status of music, and especially for music’s biggest company, Universal Music Group (UMG). After SPOT started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2018, UMG resisted the temptation to dump its reported 3.5% holding in the streaming company. Its rivals bailed: Within 90 days of Spotify going public, indie label group Merlin sold its entire stake, worth around $100 million; Warner Music Group sold its entire stake, worth $504 million; and Sony Music Entertainment hedged by selling 50% of its stake, collecting $768 million. Universal held on, and its stake is now worth $1.74 billion, while Sony Music’s remaining stake (around 2.9%) is worth $1.42 billion.

But while Universal and Sony might be getting rich off Spotify’s rise in the short-term, they’re doing so for reasons that could be harming their own businesses in the long term — because Spotify’s buoyant run in the market actually has nothing to do with music.

Spotify’s stock price has doubled in three months for a simple reason: It’s doubled down on its podcast play. Within this, there have been two key catalysts: 1. Spotify’s May acquisition of exclusive rights to the Joe Rogan Experience, Apple’s biggest podcast of last year, in a reported $100 million deal; 2. Spotify’s June success of two more exclusive deals, one with Kim Kardashian West for a program focusing on criminal justice, and one with superhero giant DC Entertainment and Warner Bros, which will hand over scripted podcasts set in the DC universe.

Top analysts immediately nudged up their price targets for Spotify, driving investor enthusiasm and sending the market cap spiraling ever-upward. One of the most telling of these analyst notes came on June 19th from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz, who increased his Spotify share price target to $275. (Shares had hovered around $140 pre-COVID.) In addition to “attractive monetization potential” from these podcast deals, Zgutowicz suggested that Spot could also create “future leverage to premium subscription pricing and label negotiations.”

Zgutowicz is hinting that, as podcasts become an increasingly bigger entity on Spotify, they could loosen record labels’ command of future deal terms — i.e. how much Spotify pays the music industry. Interestingly, Spotify’s previous global licensing deal with Universal Music Group expired early last year, and a successor agreement has still not been announced. One sticking point: What happens to a Spotify subscriber’s cash if they’re solely listening to podcasts and not music on the app? Another inevitable question: What share, if any, should the labels get of Spotify advertising dollars associated with podcast plays? Especially those generated via Spotify’s own ‘Streaming Ad Insertion’ technology?

Other Wall Street analysts have chimed in with similar rosy outlooks, all linked to the streaming service’s big-spending podcast strategy. Last Wednesday (June 24th), Goldman Sachs’ Heath Terry upped his price target to $280, espousing his optimism over Spotify’s “stream of exclusive podcast deals, acquisitions, and new podcast monetization functionality” — and contributing to a 7% boost in market cap. In his research note, Terry added: “We believe the exclusivity potential in the category creates a meaningful opportunity to differentiate [Spotify] in a way that has proven more difficult in Recorded Music, even though it may take years to generate meaningful financial returns.”

I have written at length about the serious threat podcasts pose to music royalties on services like Spotify, which ultimately comes down to talk content’s growing share of listening hours on the service. Per an oft-cited Edison study, more than 100 million Americans listened to a podcast in the last month; according to MusicWatch, just 79.7 million Americans were paying for music streaming by the close of 2019.

Spotify’s aim with podcasts, as pointed out by Zgutowicz, is to improve its profitability by tilting the balance of power away from the record labels, which today suck out so much of Spotify’s revenue via royalty payments that the streaming company still isn’t consistently profitable. Spotify’s key tactic in this mission is to draw listening away from royalty-bearing content (music) towards non-royalty-bearing content (podcasts).

But will the labels put up with it much longer? That depends on leverage — specifically, how dominant Spotify can stay in the music marketplace while storming ahead with podcasts, and whether Universal, Sony and Warner will continue considering the company peerlessly essential to their own bottom lines.

Spotify’s big advantage: It remains, by some margin, the largest subscription music service on the planet. Recent stats from Midia Research suggest that, at the close of March this year, Spotify claimed 32% of 400 million paying music streaming subscribers worldwide. That was not far off double Apple Music’s haul (at Number Two, with 72 million).

For the record labels to gain negotiating power with Spotify, they need its dominance gradually ebbed away by a fiercely competitive global marketplace. So they will doubtlessly be pleased that — according to my reading of Midia’s numbers — Apple Music, YouTube Music and Amazon Music combined grew by 38 million paying subscribers in the year to end of Q1 2020; in the same time period, according to its own financials, Spotify grew by a lesser volume of 30 million.

Playing on Spotify’s mind will be the fact that the record labels also have unused emergency tactics to call on. They could each decide to pull their content off Spotify’s free tier in certain countries, for example, suddenly slowing down SPOT’s subscriber growth potential. Or even choose a more nuclear option.

In 2018, Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer was asked whether a Sony-owned music streaming platform could ever enter the global market to challenge Spotify. Stringer replied: “Do we want to take all our stuff off a major streaming platform? No — we have an arrangement that is working for both of us. But the next chapter might be in five years. Who knows?”

https://news.sky.com/story/london-stock-exchange-in-talks-to-buy-stake-in-retail-shares-star-primarybid-12017923,"The owner of the London Stock Exchange is in talks to buy a stake in the British technology start-up which has helped ordinary investors access billions of pounds of corporate fundraisings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sky News has learnt that London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) is in detailed negotiations about becoming a shareholder in PrimaryBid, an app which pools stock orders from small investors, aggregating them into one substantial application.

PrimaryBid has become a prominent player in London's equity market in the last few months as major companies have rushed to shore up their balance sheets because of the coronavirus crisis.

It already has a commercial agreement with LSEG, struck last November, which involves the two businesses working together to improve the digital infrastructure required for individual investors to access public share offerings.

The tech company's big breakthrough came in May, when Compass Group, the FTSE 100 catering giant, chose it to run the retail component of its £2bn share placing - the largest such equity fundraising to emerge so far during the pandemic.

PrimaryBid has since been involved in smaller deals for dozens of companies, including the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and SSP Group, the transport food concessions operator behind the Ritazza brand.

Image: PrimaryBid's big breakthrough came during the Compass share placing last month

The company's explosive growth has been aided by shrewd marketing: in April, it published an open letter calling for listed company bosses to accommodate retail investors when raising capital.

Concerns had emerged that ordinary savers were being short-changed by being denied the chance to participate in heavily discounted share sales, compounding the pain after seeing the value of their stock portfolios shrink during the market downturn.

The open letter was signed by top City figures such as Anne Richards, Fidelity International chief executive, and Peter Hargreaves, a co-founder of Hargreaves Lansdown.

PrimaryBid was also assisted by changes to the pre-emption rules at the start of the crisis, enabling companies to increase the amount of money they could raise without having to go through protracted shareholder approval processes.

People close to PrimaryBid said the last quarter had been ""a game changer"" for the company.

While it was in a healthy cash position, they said, it was exploring a large fundraising to help fuel its growth internationally.

One source said that the London Stock Exchange's parent was not the only suitor for a stake in PrimaryBid.

Others are said to include large venture capital funds and private equity firms.

LSEG is, however, said to be in advanced discussions, with a deal possible as soon as the coming weeks.

In a statement issued to Sky News, Anand Sambasivan, PrimaryBid's chief executive, said: ""The last three months have been transformative for PrimaryBid and we are excited by the tremendous new interest in our capital markets technology.

""Our partnership with the London Stock Exchange is built on respect and admiration for its incredible history, and for our shared desire to empower retail investors.""

The size of its likely funding round is expected to be several times larger than the roughly £7m it raised last year from investors such as Outward VC and Hambro Perks.

An LSEG spokesman declined to comment on the discussions about the purchase of an equity stake in PrimaryBid.

Charlie Walker, head of equity primary markets at the London Stock Exchange, said last November that their commercial partnership was ""part of our ongoing commitment to broaden the services available to retail investors.

""Individual investors and issuers will benefit from the additional capital and liquidity available through PrimaryBid's platform, helping to make markets more accessible for all.""","   Skip to content           Watch Live     Menu         Home   UK   World   Politics   US   Climate   Science & Tech   Business   Ents & Arts   Travel   Offbeat   Analysis   Opinion   Videos   Weather     More   Home   UK   World   Politics   US   Climate   Science & Tech   Business   Ents & Arts   Travel   Offbeat   Analysis   Opinion   Videos   Weather        Watch Live                        London Stock Exchange in talks to buy stake in retail shares star PrimaryBid   LSEG is in talks with a retail share-buying app which has grown rapidly during the COVID-19 crisis, Sky News learns.

Advertisement         PrimaryBid has since been involved in smaller deals for dozens of companies, including the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and SSP Group, the transport food concessions operator behind the Ritazza brand.            Image:  PrimaryBid's big breakthrough came during the Compass share placing last month     The company's explosive growth has been aided by shrewd marketing: in April, it published an open letter calling for listed company bosses to accommodate retail investors when raising capital.

The open letter was signed by top City figures such as Anne Richards, Fidelity International chief executive, and Peter Hargreaves, a co-founder of Hargreaves Lansdown. PrimaryBid was also assisted by changes to the pre-emption rules at the start of the crisis, enabling companies to increase the amount of money they could raise without having to go through protracted shareholder approval processes. People close to PrimaryBid said the last quarter had been ""a game changer"" for the company. While it was in a healthy cash position, they said, it was exploring a large fundraising to help fuel its growth internationally. One source said that the London Stock Exchange's parent was not the only suitor for a stake in PrimaryBid. Others are said to include large venture capital funds and private equity firms. LSEG is, however, said to be in advanced discussions, with a deal possible as soon as the coming weeks. In a statement issued to Sky News, Anand Sambasivan, PrimaryBid's chief executive, said: ""The last three months have been transformative for PrimaryBid and we are excited by the tremendous new interest in our capital markets technology. ""Our partnership with the London Stock Exchange is built on respect and admiration for its incredible history, and for our shared desire to empower retail investors."" The size of its likely funding round is expected to be several times larger than the roughly £7m it raised last year from investors such as Outward VC and Hambro Perks. An LSEG spokesman declined to comment on the discussions about the purchase of an equity stake in PrimaryBid. Charlie Walker, head of equity primary markets at the London Stock Exchange, said last November that their commercial partnership was ""part of our ongoing commitment to broaden the services available to retail investors. ""Individual investors and issuers will benefit from the additional capital and liquidity available through PrimaryBid's platform, helping to make markets more accessible for all.""

The Dow, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq ended the day all positive after positive news from home sales and the rising shares of Boeing from approval to test its 737 Max.

TheStreet's Katherine Ross discussed breaking news in the stock market on StreetLightning with Jim Cramer. Cramer spoke about selling Facebook shares, Disney stock hurting, and what it will take for President Trump to wear a mask.

Facebook Stock: Buy or Sell?

Facebook shares were up despite more companies are pulling their advertising spending from the social media giant in July. Investors must believe this is an opportunity to buy Facebook stock after it fell almost 10% in trading last week. TheStreet gave investors a guide on how to trade Facebook shares while companies continue to boycott spending on advertising with Facebook.

Cramer has finally had enough with Mark Zuckerberg's stance on hate speech on his platform and believes it's time to sell some shares until Facebook addresses this issue.

Disney Stock: Buy or Sell?

Disney can't seem to catch a break since the coronavirus pandemic hit and investors are probably wondering when to buy or sell Disney shares. Disney relies on large crowds at its amusement parks and large crowds going to movie theatres for its feature films and the coronavirus pandemic is preventing either of those two scenarios from occurring. The successful launch of Disney+ is helping reduce the pain and the upcoming release of the Hamilton musical on the streaming service could give the company another boost in sign-ups.

What does Cramer believe needs to happen for Disney to get some relief in this market?

When Will President Trump Wear a Mask?

Cramer has spoken at length about the need to start wearing masks when in public places. Cramer also debunked some of the myths that peddlers of misinformation started spreading once mask mandates were starting in places around the world. So what will it take President Trump to buy into the idea of wearing a mask to help his supporters take this necessary safety measure?

Cramer talks about why President Trump needs to start wearing a mask, so America can move on and start flattening the curve.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/breakdown-church-and-state/613498/,"But religious and nonreligious groups are not being treated equally under the program. Far from it. The Small Business Administration has granted a special exemption from its eligibility rules. Those rules are designed to guarantee that PPP loans support only small business and nonprofits, defined as those with fewer than 500 employers. To that end, one of the rules denies aid to organizations that are affiliated with larger entities. For religious nonprofits, however, the SBA has waived that rule.

As a result, many religious organizations, including thousands of local congregations, received hundreds of millions, and likely billions, of dollars in PPP loans—even though they are affiliated with large organizations that altogether have more than 500 employees.

Yet secular nonprofits—such as the Boys and Girls Club, the YMCA, and Goodwill—that may have similar affiliation structures are not eligible for this exemption. In fact, they may be entirely excluded from receiving PPP loans. Many local chapters of national nonprofits may not have applied for federal aid because they feared they were ineligible, while others requested and received aid. Now these large nonprofits are facing legal risks that religious entities are not. The SBA’s implementation of the program thus privileges nationally affiliated religious organizations over their nonreligious counterparts. The extent of this disparity should become clearer when the SBA discloses more detailed data about PPP loans and their recipients, which it has now promised to do, reversing its earlier refusal to release such information.

For now, the SBA’s discrimination in favor of religious organizations is most visible in the case of Planned Parenthood. When PPP funding became available, 38 local Planned Parenthood centers requested and received federal loans totaling about $80 million. But the SBA is now demanding that those Planned Parenthood affiliates return the money they received. It claims that these local centers are ineligible because they are controlled by a national umbrella organization, Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

A group of 27 Republican senators, led by Tom Cotton and Mitch McConnell, latched on to this argument. In a May 21 letter, they called on Attorney General William Barr to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and suggested that the affiliates should be subjected to civil and criminal penalties for filing fraudulent loan applications. Senator Marco Rubio, who chairs the Senate committee that oversees the SBA, also demanded that the agency cancel PPP loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates and investigate them for wrongdoing. In response, Senate Democrats charged the SBA with attacking Planned Parenthood for partisan, ideological purposes. For its part, Planned Parenthood released a statement saying that its local centers satisfy the SBA’s existing eligibility requirements.","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe     More in This Series More From The Battle for the Constitution  See Project  Social Conservatives Are Learning All the Wrong Lessons From Trump   Mary Ziegler       The Senate Filibuster Is Another Monument to White Supremacy   David Litt       The Supreme Court Didn’t Have to Rely on Xenophobic Logic   Leah Litman       The Trans Future I Never Dreamed Of   Chase Strangio           Ideas   The Separation of Church and State Is Breaking Down Under Trump   Religious groups are getting special treatment from the government’s pandemic-relief efforts.   June 29, 2020  Micah Schwartzman Law professor at the University of Virginia Richard Schragger Law professor at the University of Virginia Nelson Tebbe Law professor at Cornell University      Getty / The Atlantic     Link Copied    The separation of Church and state is supposed to prevent government favoritism of religion in the United States. For most of the past century, the Supreme Court interpreted the establishment clause of the First Amendment to mean that government cannot “pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another.” Under this principle of disestablishment, at the very least, the government cannot give special privileges to religious organizations beyond what is available to similarly situated nonreligious groups. But the past few months have seen a near-complete collapse of this principle at the national level, at least with respect to government funding of religion. Under the Payment Protection Program, which has allocated $669 billion in subsidies to support small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, the government has extended funding to churches and other houses of worship. This program is unprecedented in terms of the sheer amount of money involved and the religious nature of the activities, including payment of clergy salaries, that the government is subsidizing. As we recently wrote in The New York Times , this funding of faith-based organizations has received little attention, in part because of the sense that churches, like other groups, have been harmed by government-ordered shutdowns. If churches have to comply with public-health restrictions like other businesses and nonprofits, then they should also be compensated, the thinking goes. In short, they should receive equal treatment when it comes to PPP funding.        But religious and nonreligious groups are not being treated equally under the program. Far from it. The Small Business Administration has granted a special exemption from its eligibility rules. Those rules are designed to guarantee that PPP loans support only small business and nonprofits, defined as those with fewer than 500 employers. To that end, one of the rules denies aid to organizations that are affiliated with larger entities. For religious nonprofits, however, the SBA has waived that rule . As a result, many religious organizations, including thousands of local congregations, received hundreds of millions, and likely billions , of dollars in PPP loans—even though they are affiliated with large organizations that altogether have more than 500 employees. Yet secular nonprofits—such as the Boys and Girls Club, the YMCA, and Goodwill—that may have similar affiliation structures are not eligible for this exemption. In fact, they may be entirely excluded from receiving PPP loans. Many local chapters of national nonprofits may not have applied for federal aid because they feared they were ineligible, while others requested and received aid . Now these large nonprofits are facing legal risks that religious entities are not. The SBA’s implementation of the program thus privileges nationally affiliated religious organizations over their nonreligious counterparts. The extent of this disparity should become clearer when the SBA discloses more detailed data about PPP loans and their recipients, which it has now promised to do, reversing its earlier refusal to release such information. For now, the SBA’s discrimination in favor of religious organizations is most visible in the case of Planned Parenthood.

Senator Marco Rubio , who chairs the Senate committee that oversees the SBA, also demanded that the agency cancel PPP loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates and investigate them for wrongdoing. In response, Senate Democrats charged the SBA with attacking Planned Parenthood for partisan, ideological purposes. For its part, Planned Parenthood released a statement saying that its local centers satisfy the SBA’s existing eligibility requirements.        This back-and-forth between Republican and Democratic senators is only the latest iteration of political conflicts over abortion. Conservative politicians have long sought to defund Planned Parenthood because of its support for women’s reproductive rights, including abortion services; liberals and progressives have in turn defended the organization. So the Republicans’ motivation for targeting Planned Parenthood is no mystery. There is, however, a more fundamental problem with these recent attacks on Planned Parenthood—a constitutional defect that even critics of the organization should recognize. By privileging religious organizations over secular nonprofits, the SBA and GOP senators are advancing a position that contravenes the establishment clause, which forbids the government from giving special subsidies to religious organizations. One might have thought that the separation of Church and state would bar churches from receiving PPP loans to fund clergy salaries. But even as the Supreme Court has moved away from a principle of separation, initially by allowing public funding of religious organizations and now more and more toward requiring equal treatment, a policy of favoring religious groups would turn the establishment clause completely on its head. And indeed, one important and longstanding objection to a regime of equal funding is that it leads precisely to this result, namely, preferential treatment for religion. The SBA’s implementation of PPP funding shows how equal treatment can devolve into such favoritism. The Trump Administration has claimed that churches must receive federal funding on equal terms with secular nonprofits. But the SBA’s religious waiver of its affiliation rules means that religious groups are not, in fact, being treated equally—they are being favored, and on a massive scale. Religious groups that would otherwise be excluded from funding under neutral affiliation rules can receive billions of dollars in federal aid, while organizations like Planned Parenthood receive nothing. Why should secular nonprofits be treated one way and religious groups another? The SBA waived its affiliation rules for faith-based organizations because it believed that those rules would “substantially burden” groups that are religiously committed to hierarchical forms of organization, and because it thought the affiliation rules would entangle courts in determinations about how religious organizations are structured. According to the SBA, its religious exemption is authorized under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the federal government from imposing substantial burdens on religion, and perhaps under the First Amendment, which has been interpreted to limit government interference with the internal decisions of religious organizations.        There is reason to be skeptical about these arguments. Neutral affiliation rules, which limit the size of loan recipients, do not obviously trigger protection under the RFRA or interfere with the internal decision making of religious organizations. But if those dangers exist, they can be addressed by exempting all nonprofits from the affiliation rules—by treating all such employers equally. What cannot be justified is granting religious groups an accommodation that enables federal funding while disadvantaging secular organizations that are similarly structured and that have been burdened by the same pandemic-related public-health regulations. The SBA’s unequal application of its rules conflicts with existing legal doctrine under the establishment clause. The Supreme Court held in a crucial 1989 case, Texas Monthly v. Bullock , that Texas could not exempt religious periodicals from its sales tax while taxing secular ones like Texas Monthly . In a controlling concurring opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that “a State may not give a tax break to those who spread the gospel that it does not also give to others who actively might advocate disbelief in religion.” But here the SBA has done much the same thing. The Supreme Court recently emphasized the importance of treating religious organizations like nonreligious groups in granting public benefits. Last month, in the first Supreme Court decision involving churches during the COVID-19 outbreak, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a dissenting opinion that “the Church and its congregants simply want to be treated equally to comparable secular businesses.” But when it comes to PPP funding, some churches don’t want equality. They want to be treated more favorably than their secular counterparts. Planned Parenthood affiliates have constitutional grounds for resisting demands to return their PPP loans. If small religious nonprofits are eligible to receive PPP funds, even though they are affiliates of large national organizations, then the same eligibility rules must apply to secular nonprofits such as Planned Parenthood. There cannot be two sets of funding rules—one that sends billions of dollars to local religious congregations and one that denies the same support to secular nonprofits. If those rules are constitutional, even as they allow more direct financial support for churches than at any other point in American history, then the establishment clause has lost its meaning. At the very least, it must stand for the proposition that the government cannot pick out religious organizations for special privileges. If that principle collapses, the country will be witnessing not only the end of the separation of church and state with respect to public funding but also a subversion of the commitment to equal treatment that is said to be replacing it. Instead, what will exist is a regime that favors religious organizations above others.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gao-t-solve-2-7-103042904.html,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last week, the Government Accountability Office issued the first comprehensive analysis of how trillions of dollars of taxpayer money is being spent to protect Americans, the economy and public services from the ravages of Covid-19. Its broad conclusions aren’t reassuring.

The report paints a picture of a federal government that is managing a gargantuan effort, at best, haphazardly. The government is either unable or reluctant to provide enough data and financial information to put clothing on what this $2.7 trillion effort truly looks like — and whether the funds are being deployed in a broadly successful way.

We’re fortunate to have the GAO at this moment because other watchdog groups meant to keep an eye on the biggest bailout in U.S. history — particularly an inspector general appointed by the president and a special bipartisan committee set up by Congress — haven’t produced any robust public assessments. That leaves the door open to possible abuses. For example, as the Washington Post reported on Friday, the White House has made it easier for government insiders to obtain bailout loans from the Small Business Administration, creating a raft of conflicts of interest.

While most Americans are aware that the federal government has undertaken this rescue, few know where the money is landing and what impact it’s having because details have been scarce.

As we wrote previously, Congress, the White House and the Federal Reserve should be commended for the speed and boldness of their response to the crisis. But speed alone isn’t a virtue if the money is wasted. Funds that go to the wrong people, groups, companies or public services in the name of timeliness may not achieve their intended goals. And it’s impossible to assess that without more information. So the GAO – a nonpartisan federal agency that provides auditing and analysis to Congress — is an important addition to the conversation. The GAO is also populated with experienced employees who have waded into complex tasks like this before, such as its audits of the 2008 financial bailout.

Yet even the GAO said it has had difficulty obtaining all the information it needs to assess money allotted through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act three months ago. Some of this is due to federal guidelines. The report notes, for example, that total federal spending data “are not readily available” because the Office of Management and Budget doesn’t require federal agencies to report Covid-19 related spending until July.

Nevertheless, the GAO found numerous problems with the various financial rescue programs. The Paycheck Protection Program, for example, was intended to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll during the shutdown by channeling government-backed loans through banks and other private lenders. But eligibility criteria for PPP funds was fuzzy, which created confusion for borrowers and lenders and resulted in money landing in the wrong hands.

The SBA, which has already been widely criticized for how poorly it rolled out payments to distressed entrepreneurs, gets a similar drubbing in the GAO report. In its haste to disburse funds, the SBA allowed lenders to rely on borrowers’ certifications that they were eligible for a PPP loan — opening the door to possible fraud and other shenanigans that put hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money at risk. More broadly, the SBA still doesn’t appear to have measures in place to ensure that PPP functions properly. The GAO describes the SBA as hindered by problems with communication, processing capabilities, information technology and financial insight.

Federal agencies also ran into problems trying to deliver one-time payments to average Americans under the CARES Act. The money failed to reach some people, while others received funds to which they weren’t entitled. In one of the more tragicomic missteps the GAO outlined, the Treasury Department sent 1.1 million payments worth $1.4 billion to dead people. Why? Treasury doesn’t have access to “death data” that the Social Security Administration maintains. The fix? Simply give Treasury that data. The GAO said that Treasury officials became aware that the funds went to the dead only after it was reported in the media.

Story continues There are also concerns that the various stimulus programs are undermining one another. The CARES Act provides extra unemployment insurance to laid-off workers, and by last month states had already received a staggering 42 million unemployment claims. But the GAO says the Department of Labor has left states in the dark about bailout recipients who may have improperly double-dipped by receiving both PPP funds and unemployment benefits. The GAO found other shortfalls that could imperil the public’s well-being. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, acknowledged that it had provided limited Covid-19 testing data to the GAO’s analysts — apparently because it possesses limited data. The consequences of that? Well: “The absence of complete and consistent Covid-19 testing data reported through May 31, 2020, has made it more difficult to track and know the infection rate, mitigate the effect of infections, and inform decisions on reopening communities.” Testing remains a core competency during a pandemic. But the GAO reports that laboratories and public health industry groups complained of shortages of testing machines and highlighted “the need for centralized federal coordination for procurement of needed supplies.” When the GAO assesses the availability of medical supplies the federal government is meant to stockpile for national emergencies, similar alarm bells ring. “While agencies have taken actions to provide medical equipment and supplies, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, to states and other entities to help health care workers to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, concerns have been reported about the distribution, acquisition, and adequacy of supplies.” Demand for medical gear, PPE, pharmaceuticals and other necessities quickly outpaced the supply when the coronavirus took hold in the spring, causing mayors and governors across the country to ask the White House to coordinate the federal response more effectively. That has yet to happen. And the GAO said that it had requested information from the government about the status of emergency stockpiles but hadn’t received it as of mid-June. This isn’t a new problem, by the way. The GAO said that the government’s emergency supply gaps have been worrisome for years. “In 2003, we reported that urban hospitals lacked the necessary equipment, such as PPE, to respond to a large influx of patients experiencing respiratory problems caused by a bioterrorism event requiring a similar response to a naturally occurring disease outbreak.” Effectively delivering housing assistance to the needy is a concern, too. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development received a relatively modest amount of bailout funding, $12.4 billion, the GAO pointed out “persistent management challenges” at the agency Secretary Ben Carson oversees. Those shortcomings, which include turnover in HUD’s senior leadership and “shifting priorities,” haven’t helped “ensure effective management” at the agency. The GAO specifically noted that such problems could ultimately hurt low-income Americans who rely on bailout funds to stay in their homes. Some of the report’s conclusions are particularly bracing. It notes, for example, that the “federal government continues to lack a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks” — leaving the country at risk both now and during any possible future pandemics. The GAO’s report is also useful because it can help build a better blueprint for how future bailouts are orchestrated. With the number of new coronavirus cases surging again, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the pandemic won’t end quickly and that more stimulus will likely be needed. The GAO offers recommendations about how to fix some of the problems it identified. It says, for example, that the SBA should monitor possible fraud more carefully in the PPP program. It also recommends that the Internal Revenue Service tell ineligible recipients of stimulus checks how they can return the money. But these are mechanical improvements. Other problems and recommendations the GAO lays out expose a more fundamental issue: The rescue effort needs a unifying framework that would allow it to be more easily administered, documented and reported to taxpayers (something we’ve written about here.) Instead, as the GAO lays bare, the bailout is a patchwork of programs run by far-flung federal agencies that don’t seem to communicate with one another very effectively. While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is meant to be a primary coordinating force in the bailout effort, there is not much coordination on display in the GAO report. Ultimately, the rescue effort should preserve individuals’ well-being and the foundations of the economy so life can return to normal once the virus abates. That doesn’t require a hodgepodge of numerous programs. It requires targeting the money where it’s most needed. In our opinion, individuals and families should be prioritized now and in the future. But regardless of how the programs are built, the efforts have to have transparency and accountability. And the GAO report is a reminder that our government is currently providing neither of those.

Credit... Rich Tu By  Kerry Hannon Published June 11, 2020 Updated June 18, 2020 This article is part of Owning the Future , a series on how small businesses across the country are coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The pain and insecurity of the shock of the coronavirus on small-business owners have been overwhelming. Entrepreneurs have taken extreme steps to stay operational, and many are deeply worried about their prospects in the coming months and beyond. But help is out there. Federal, state and local governments, as well as communities, corporations and foundations have stepped up with financial resources. For a small business trying to stay afloat during the shock of the coronavirus, every little bit of financial aid can have a bearing on their future. For Amy Bass, owner of Nota Bene , a fine-paper boutique in Pittsburgh, her lifeline was a small loan from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. “It helped by getting one of my full-time employees off unemployment and paying one month’s rent,” she said. It has been a rough ride as she worked through the two-month closure. “We are now open, but pretty much all events throughout the end of the year, including holiday parties have been canceled,” Ms. Bass said. “It will be a long year for us.” Here’s a rundown of what are available, but keep in mind that the rules continue to change. Small Business Administration The agency is providing grants and low-interest loans for small-business owners financially affected as a result of the coronavirus. But a warning: Demand is high, and the process may not be swift.   The Paycheck Protection Program provides a loan that is fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities (a portion of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll). No collateral or personal guarantees are required. Neither the government nor lenders will charge businesses any fees. Forgiveness is based on the employer’s maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels. Forgiveness will be reduced if the full-time head count of the business declines, or if salaries and wages decrease, according to the S.B.A. website. The S.B.A.’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program offers an advance of up to $10,000 to provide economic relief. Applications are limited to provide loans to U.S. agricultural businesses with 500 or fewer employees. The interest rate is 3.75 percent. Loans can have repayments of up to 30 years. The agency is also providing small businesses that have a relationship with an S.B.A. Express Lender to access a bridge loan of up to $25,000. Apply online at the S.B.A.’s website or call the agency at 800-659-2955. The site has a directory to find its local offices. State and Local Governments They also have small-business assistance programs of their own. The New York City Department of Small Business Services, for example, can help businesses apply for loans and other financial products. There are free small-group and one-on-one consultations to help businesses evaluate and apply for financing and access to city-sponsored special loans and grants. In San Francisco, Mayor London N. Breed and the Office of Economic and Workforce Development recently announced the opening of the application process for $6.5 million in funds to support small businesses affected by the coronavirus. This includes $1.5 million for San Francisco’s Small Business Resiliency Fund grant program to provide at least 190 businesses up to $10,000 in aid. An additional $5 million is earmarked for the Hardship Emergency Loan Program (SF HELP) in the form of up to $50,000 in zero-percent interest loans to around 100 small businesses.         The Coronavirus Outbreak                Frequently Asked Questions and Advice  Updated June 30, 2020    What are the symptoms of coronavirus?  Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.      What’s the best material for a mask?  Scientists around the country have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles.      Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask?  A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.” Masks do alter exercise , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.      I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work?  The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.      What is pandemic paid leave?  The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.      Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?  So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,” but she later walked back that statement.      What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?  Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals . But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.      How does blood type influence coronavirus?  A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19 , the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.      How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?  The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.      How can I protect myself while flying?  If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)      What should I do if I feel sick?  If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.                            Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania recently announced a $225 million statewide grant program to support small businesses that were affected by coronavirus and business-closure orders. Check with your mayor’s or governor’s office for resources and updates. Companies, Crowdfunding and Foundations Governments are not the only ones helping out. Foundations, websites and other entrepreneurs have jumped in. Here are some. Local Chambers of Commerce are also supporting their small-business owners. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation has a state-by-state guide that outlines the different loans, grants and funds that state and local governments — as well as private organizations — are offering. Hello Alice , a platform that helps entrepreneurs connect with other business owners, government resources, potential funders and mentors, is offering $10,000 grants to small businesses, supplied by Silicon Valley Bank, the eBay Foundation, UBS and other partners. The first rounds are complete, but the group will provide more rounds of funding through July 16. The Red Backpack Fund , which is backed by Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, is donating $5,000 grants to 1,000 female entrepreneurs. The fund is accepting applications in cycles. The most recent started June 1; future cycles will begin on July 6 and Aug. 3. The LISC Small Business Relief Grants program offers up to $10,000 to small businesses affected by the coronavirus, especially entrepreneurs of color, women-owned businesses and other enterprises that don’t have access to flexible, affordable capital. The program is funded by Verizon, Sam’s Club and others. Its next application round is scheduled to open on June 11. GoFundMe, the fund-raising platform , has started the Small Business Relief Initiative , partnering with Yelp, Intuit QuickBooks, Bill.com and GoDaddy to provide owners with grants and resources. GoFundMe, QuickBooks and Yelp have each donated $500,000 to the Small Business Relief Fund , and it is open for anyone to make a donation. There will also be $500 matching grants to qualifying businesses that raise at least $500 on GoFundMe. IFundWomen, a crowdfunding platform, is giving microgrants to women-run businesses, issued on a rolling basis. “Start a campaign” to be considered for a coronavirus relief grant.

June 29, 2020

Governor Tom Wolf announced that beginning tomorrow small businesses across Pennsylvania can apply for grants to offset lost revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shutdown order.

“In unprecedented times, like those we are currently facing, collaboration is imperative to getting help to those who need it most, as quickly and effectively as possible,” said Gov. Wolf. “This joint effort between my administration, the legislature, and The Pennsylvania CDFI Network will provide critical assistance to Pennsylvania’s small businesses, putting them on better financial footing as they begin to reopen.”

The COVID-19 Relief Statewide Small Business Assistance program, announced earlier this month, will provide $225 million in grants ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 to eligible businesses through Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding.

Beginning tomorrow, June 30, eligible businesses may begin applying for the COVID-19 Relief Statewide Small Business Assistance program here.

The first application window will remain open for ten days. Applications will continue to be accepted after 10 business days but will be considered for future rounds of funding, as this is not a first-come, first-served program. Applications will be prioritized and selected for funding based on the program criteria.

The Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) will distribute the funds to the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which will then administer the funding in the form of grants.

Today, DCED Secretary Dennis Davin joined state Senate Democratic Leader Jay Costa, Senator Vincent Hughes, Senator John Blake, Representative Jordan Harris, Mark Masterson of Northside Community Development Fund, Leslie Benoliel of Entrepreneur Works, Jim Burnett of West Philadelphia Financial Services, and Dan Betancourt from the Community First Fund at a virtual press conference to announce the opening of the first of four application windows.

Eligible businesses will be able to use the grants to cover operating expenses during the shutdown and transition to re-opening, and for technical assistance including training and guidance for business owners as they stabilize and relaunch their businesses.

The funds will be available through three programs:

$100 million for the Main Street Business Revitalization Program for small businesses that experienced loss as a result of the governor’s March 19, 2020 order relating to the closure of all non-life-sustaining businesses and have or will incur costs to adapt to new business operations related to COVID-19;

$100 million for the Historically Disadvantaged Business Revitalization Program for small businesses that experienced loss as a result of the business closure order, have or will incur costs to adapt to new business operations related to COVID-19, and in which socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51 percent interest and also control management and daily business operations.

$25 million for the Loan Payment Deferment and Loss Reserve Program, which will allow the CDFIs the opportunity to offer forbearance and payment relief for existing portfolio businesses that are struggling due to the impact of COVID, as well as shore up the financial position of the CDFIs that are experiencing significant increased defaults in their existing loan portfolios.

This project is financed by a grant from the federal Department of U.S. Treasury, under the administration of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania CDFI Network. The PA CDFI Network is a group of 17 PA-based community development financial institutions that primarily provide financing options for small businesses.

https://www.blackenterprise.com/small-businesses-have-until-june-30-to-apply-for-the-128-billion-left-in-ppp-loans/,"If you are a small business owner who has not applied for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding you can still do so. But you need to act now.

That is because the deadline for PPP applications is Tuesday, June 30. There was a whopping, more than $128 billion of funding not claimed based on loan approvals through June 20, data from the U.S. Small Business Administration shows. The federal agency runs the program working with the U.S. Treasury.

At the same time, it has not been determined if the PPP deadline for applications will be extended if money is left on the table.

Since being launched in early April in two rounds, the SBA has approved more than $514 billion in funding covering over 4.6 million loans. The latest average overall loan size was $114,000.

The PPP keeps small business employees on payroll by offering critical capital. The lending program for firms with up to 500 workers became law in late March as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package. All told, the PPP was intended to provide more than $660 billion in PPP loans to help small businesses deal with the crushing blow of COVID-19.

“Eligible borrowers still have time to take advantage of these forgivable loans that aim to sustain business and keep employees on payroll,” SBA spokesperson Carol Wilkerson told Black Enterprise.

On June 19, the SBA launched an online tool for small businesses and nonprofits to be matched with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Certified Development Companies (CDCs), Farm Credit System lenders, Microlenders, as well as traditional smaller asset size lenders in the PPP.

The SBA’s Lender Match is an extra resource for pandemic-affected small businesses who have not applied for or received an approved PPP loan to connect with lenders.

“The SBA is focused on assisting eligible borrowers in underserved and disadvantaged communities and connecting them with forgivable PPP loans, especially before the June 30, 2020, application deadline,” SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said in a statement.

“As communities begin to carefully reopen across the country, there are still many more opportunities to provide this assistance to businesses who have yet to access these forgivable loans. SBA is utilizing these partnerships with CDFIs, MDIs, CDCs, Farm Credit System lenders, Microlenders and many other participating small asset lenders to ensure that access to this emergency funding reaches the most small businesses and their employees in need – a key priority for President Trump.”","                                                                            Business   Entrepreneurship  Leadership  Technology  Money  Jobs    News   Politics  Career  Education  Men  Women    Lifestyle   Fashion and Beauty  Travel and Leisure  Sports  Health & Wellness  Arts & Culture    Events   Women of Power Tech  Black Men Xcel  Entrepreneurs Summit  Women of Power Summit    Videos   Series   From The Corner Office  On The Clock  Beyond The Hype  The New Norm  Green Enterprise  In The Studio    Branded Series   Success Beyond Bars  Profiles of Principled Entrepreneurship  The Takeover  On The Tee    Podcasts   SistersInc.

But you need to act now.      That is because the deadline for PPP applications is Tuesday, June 30. There was a whopping, more than $128 billion of funding not claimed based on loan approvals through June 20, data from the U.S. Small Business Administration shows. The federal agency runs the program working with the U.S. Treasury.  At the same time, it has not been determined if the PPP deadline for applications will be extended if money is left on the table.  Since being launched in early April in two rounds, the SBA has approved more than $514 billion in funding covering over 4.6 million loans. The latest average overall loan size was $114,000.  The PPP keeps small business employees on payroll by offering critical capital. The lending program for firms with up to 500 workers became law in late March as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package. All told, the PPP  was intended to provide more than $660 billion in PPP loans to help small businesses deal with the crushing blow of COVID-19.   “Eligible borrowers still have time to take advantage of these forgivable loans that aim to sustain business and keep employees on payroll,” SBA spokesperson Carol Wilkerson told Black Enterprise .

https://dced.pa.gov/newsroom/wolf-administration-cares-act-funding-for-small-businesses-available-tomorrow/,"Harrisburg, PA – Governor Tom Wolf announced that beginning tomorrow small businesses across Pennsylvania can apply for grants to offset lost revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shutdown order.

“In unprecedented times, like those we are currently facing, collaboration is imperative to getting help to those who need it most, as quickly and effectively as possible,” said Gov. Wolf. “This joint effort between my administration, the legislature, and The Pennsylvania CDFI Network will provide critical assistance to Pennsylvania’s small businesses, putting them on better financial footing as they begin to reopen.”

The COVID-19 Relief Statewide Small Business Assistance program, announced earlier this month, will provide $225 million in grants ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 to eligible businesses through Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding.

Beginning tomorrow, June 30, eligible businesses may begin applying for the COVID-19 Relief Statewide Small Business Assistance program online.

The first application window will remain open for ten days. Applications will continue to be accepted after 10 business days but will be considered for future rounds of funding, as this is not a first-come, first-served program. Applications will be prioritized and selected for funding based on the program criteria.

The Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) will distribute the funds to the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which will then administer the funding in the form of grants.

Today, DCED Secretary Dennis Davin joined state Senate Democratic Leader Jay Costa, Senator Vincent Hughes, Senator John Blake, Representative Jordan Harris, Mark Masterson of Northside Community Development Fund, Leslie Benoliel of Entrepreneur Works, Jim Burnett of West Philadelphia Financial Services, and Dan Betancourt from the Community First Fund at a virtual press conference to announce the opening of the first of four application windows.

Eligible businesses will be able to use the grants to cover operating expenses during the shutdown and transition to re-opening, and for technical assistance including training and guidance for business owners as they stabilize and relaunch their businesses.

The funds will be available through three programs:

$100 million for the Main Street Business Revitalization Program for small businesses that experienced loss as a result of the governor’s March 19, 2020 order relating to the closure of all non-life-sustaining businesses and have or will incur costs to adapt to new business operations related to COVID-19;

$100 million for the Historically Disadvantaged Business Revitalization Program for small businesses that experienced loss as a result of the business closure order, have or will incur costs to adapt to new business operations related to COVID-19, and in which socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51 percent interest and also control management and daily business operations.

$25 million for the Loan Payment Deferment and Loss Reserve Program, which will allow the CDFIs the opportunity to offer forbearance and payment relief for existing portfolio businesses that are struggling due to the impact of COVID, as well as shore up the financial position of the CDFIs that are experiencing significant increased defaults in their existing loan portfolios.

This project is financed by a grant from the federal Department of U.S. Treasury, under the administration of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania CDFI Network. The PA CDFI Network is a group of 17 PA-based community development financial institutions that primarily provide financing options for small businesses.

New York  Citi today announced that Citi and the Citi Foundation have committed more than $100 million to date in support of COVID-19-related community relief and economic recovery efforts globally. This includes more than $35 million in new funding, adding to the previously announced $65 million in grants and charitable contributions to deliver ongoing relief and support for longer-term economic recovery in communities impacted by the global pandemic. These contributions include $2 million from Citi employees through a donation matching program.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on communities of color in the U.S., Citi and the Citi Foundation are expanding support for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which play a vital role in expanding access to safe and affordable products and services for these businesses and communities.

Michael Corbat, Citi CEO, said, “COVID-19 has brought to the forefront the racial, economic and social inequalities that exist in our communities. Partnering with community-based financial institutions to support those businesses and populations most impacted helps address the disparities that persist and support our communities in need.""

“During a time of great uncertainty and economic hardship, my colleagues once again showed their generosity and compassion by contributing more than $2 million of their own money to support COVID-19 relief efforts, which Citi matched with an additional $2 million in donations. I couldn’t be more proud or grateful to work with people who put such a high value on supporting their communities and those in need,” Mr. Corbat concluded.

Furthering plans announced in April to donate net profits from Citi’s participation in the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $25 million in initial proceeds from PPP has been donated to the Citi Foundation. The Citi Foundation is deploying $15 million in unrestricted funding of up to $500,000 per CDFI to support small businesses owned by people of color and low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. The remaining $10 million in PPP net profits was deployed by the Citi Foundation to the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) to support the New York Forward Loan Fund, which is enabling CDFIs making loans to small businesses, nonprofits and small landlords for working capital, including payroll, operating and emergency maintenance.

These philanthropic efforts complement Citi’s partnership with the National Banking Association, and the creation of a purchasing facility to assume up to $50 million in Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans from Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs).

Additional immediate relief and investments in longer-term solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world include:

North America

Donated $2.5 million to support World Central Kitchen’s #ChefsForAmerica relief effort, specifically funding 250,000 meals to those in need across the U.S. and also helping the restaurant industry and small businesses keep their doors open

https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/6/29/21306496/chicagos-theaters-streaming-revenue-covid-19-closures-canceled-seasons,"“The future’s uncertain.”

That’s essentially the response you get when you ask Chicago theater company administrators when they’ll be able to welcome back audiences to their “houses.”

For some theaters, digital content has been a means of keeping audiences engaged in lieu of COVID-19-canceled shows. But no matter how many views these streams get, they don’t even come close to making up for lost revenue generated by traditional runs. And while Illinois entered Phase 4 re-opening on June 26 — allowing for gatherings of 50 people or less — it’s a pyrrhic victory for Chicago’s theaters.

“Everybody knows 2020 is over as far as live performances go. The real fear is what’s going to happen in 2021,” said Ellen Placey-Wadey, the Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelley Foundation’s senior program director for arts and collections.

Some theaters already know: So far, COVID-19 casualties include the permanent closure of the Mercury Theatre, the comedy powerhouse iO, and Lou Conte Dance Studio. For those still standing, all planned live 2020 productions are canceled. With loans from the eight-week Payroll Protection Program (PPP) dwindling, and no shows on the horizon before 2021, everyone is on shifting sand. Streaming, theater operators say, doesn’t much improve the terrain.

Consider Theater Wit, where “Teenage Dick” went live online in April, the same week it was slated to open. The stream brought in about $27,000, according to artistic director Jeremy Wechsler. But traditional show runs generate about $55,000, he added, and once the shutdown started, Theater Wit started losing about $7,500 a week. He said he stopped paying rent in May on the company’s Lakeview space. His PPP loan covers staff through June 30, but after that, “we will be furloughing the majority of the staff, including me,” he said. “Even after we furlough the entire staff, projected revenue from streaming and donations do not make up the fixed costs of rent, utilities and insurance.”

Phase 4 provides little relief, Wechsler said: He’d have to limit audiences to 25 people and additional costs — virus testing costs, PPE equipment, cleaning — would make opening prohibitively expensive.

Theater Wit isn’t alone in trying to rise above the financial wreckage.

The House Theatre of Chicago earned $36,000 in one night by streaming their 2002 hit, “The Terrible Tragedy of Peter Pan,” said artistic director Nathan Allen. He’s not celebrating, however. “That success is in context of a roughly $300,000 - $400,000 loss in programming income,” Allen said. That loss represents 14% to 18% of the House’s $2.2 million 2020 budget.

The House and Theater Wit provide a snapshot of a bleak nationwide picture. Nationally, 12% of small arts’ businesses (less than 500 employees) don’t think they’ll ever recover to “normal,” pre-COVID-19 levels, according to a report from the National Endowment for the Arts. Another 57% say it will be at least six months before they’re producing at pre-COVID-19 levels. Between March and April, employment in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector fell from roughly 2.4 million to 1.1 million, a drop of 54.1%, the study said.

The smaller, itinerant theaters might have nominally better survival odds. Sideshow Theatre doesn’t rent or own a space or pay union rates since it’s a non-Equity house. It has only one full-time staffer. The company raised just over $11,000 streaming Kristiana Rae Colon’s “Tilikum,” and about $2,200 streaming Philip Dawkins’ “The Happiest Place on Earth.” (It donated the proceeds from “Tilikum” to the #LetUsBreathe collective.)

“We feel confident we’ll be able to survive the rest of the year,” said Sideshow artistic director Jonathan L. Green. “We will need to beef up our fundraising efforts this fall so we can keep the lights on, but because we’re not paying rent, mortgage or facilities costs, it will be easier for us.”

Porchlight Theatre also anticipates surviving, but not without making draconian cuts. While copyright laws mean the musical theater house can’t stream full shows, it’s been offering a variety of musical-themed streams, including “Musical Mondays,” which takes audience requests that Porchlight luminaries pre-record and dedicate. Other streams have included “Sondheim @90” and “Porchlight by Request.”

A PPP loan has “kept all but front of the house staff at full hours,” but come July, a 25% reduction in pay and hours will be necessary, at least through December, said Porchlight’s artistic director Michael Weber. “We are prepared to make deeper staff reductions and to consider layoffs. We can ensure survival, but not without lowering staff overhead,” he added.

For many theaters, Phase 4 won’t help much. “The economics don’t work” for Porchlight to return to live production in the 200-seat Ruth Page Center where it’s in residence, Weber said. “The big shows we had scheduled for the coming season are being moved to the 2021-2022 season, and we are taking a cautious approach to what we can produce in the 2020-2021 season. We are hoping to present smaller-scale titles in the winter and spring,” he said.

After cancelling the remainder of its 2020 performances, Lyric Opera of Chicago is providing some streamed content (from the Lyric orchestra performing Wagner from their homes to snippets of beloved operas) for its audiences, but it’s all free.

“We’re not viewing streaming as a way of generating revenue,” said Anthony Freud, general director, president and CEO of the Lyric. Its endowment “helps ensure the company’s continued survival,” he said. Since March, the Lyric has raised more than $9.6 million for its “Heroes’ Fund,” which was launched to counter COVID-induced losses.

After fiscal 2020 ends, the Lyric starts up its “For the Love of the Lyric” fund to replace the Heroes’ Fund. The Lyric did not get a PPP loan, although a consortium including the CSO, the Boston Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, The Met and New York City Ballet, is lobbying for a change of rules in order to receive assistance, a spokesperson for the Lyric said.

At the Joffrey, artistic director Ashley Wheater anticipates losing half of the company’s annual earned income due to the cancellation of the remainder of its 2020 performances, including their long-awaited debut at the Lyric Opera House, the troupe’s new home for the next seven years. A PPP loan kept the dancers on payroll through June, Wheater said. The 2020/21 budget has been slashed by 50%, he added, including pay cuts of between 5% and 20%.

Wheater’s working with the New York Public Library to digitize the company’s Joffrey’s archives, but that process could take years. In the meantime, the COVID-19 shutdown will cost the company close to $13.6 million this year. That’s more than half of the Joffrey’s annual revenues, which Guidestar reported at $21.9 million for 2019.

The Neo-Futurists might be the only company in the country making as much streaming as it did with live productions On March 22, they launched “The Infinite Wrench Goes Viral,” available on Patreon starting at $3 a ticket. Live “Wrench” made about $2,200 weekly, and “Wrench Goes Viral” makes the same, said artistic director Kirsten Riiber.

“Are we at risk of losing a whole generation of artists? It’s an existential crisis,” said Greg Reiner, the NEA’s theater and musical theater director/performing arts. “Chicago might be in better shape than most because there are so many small, nimble, itinerant theaters there, and it could be easier for them to navigate this than the larger houses with rent and real estate.”

The Lyric did not get a PPP loan, although a consortium including the CSO, the Boston Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, The Met and New York City Ballet, is lobbying for a change of rules in order to receive assistance, a spokesperson for the Lyric said.  At the Joffrey, artistic director Ashley Wheater anticipates losing half of the company’s annual earned income due to the cancellation of the remainder of its 2020 performances, including their long-awaited debut at the Lyric Opera House, the troupe’s new home for the next seven years. A PPP loan kept the dancers on payroll through June, Wheater said. The 2020/21 budget has been slashed by 50%, he added, including pay cuts of between 5% and 20%.  Wheater’s working with the New York Public Library to digitize the company’s Joffrey’s archives, but that process could take years. In the meantime, the COVID-19 shutdown will cost the company close to $13.6 million this year. That’s more than half of the Joffrey’s annual revenues, which Guidestar reported at $21.9 million for 2019.  The Neo-Futurists might be the only company in the country making as much streaming as it did with live productions On March 22, they launched “The Infinite Wrench Goes Viral,” available on Patreon starting at $3 a ticket. Live “Wrench” made about $2,200 weekly, and “Wrench Goes Viral” makes the same, said artistic director Kirsten Riiber.  “Are we at risk of losing a whole generation of artists? It’s an existential crisis,” said Greg Reiner, the NEA’s theater and musical theater director/performing arts. “Chicago might be in better shape than most because there are so many small, nimble, itinerant theaters there, and it could be easier for them to navigate this than the larger houses with rent and real estate.”   Catey Sullivan is a local freelance writer.

But as the June 30 loan application deadline looms — and after a more recent revamping of several of the program’s initial flaws — more than $130 billion in would-be loans remains untouched. According to an official report, that’s more than three times the amount of money that’s been loaned to restaurants and others in the “accommodation and food service” category, which has been particularly impacted by COVID-19, thus far.

From inception, the loan program has faced criticism. During the first wave of loan approvals, some major chains like Shake Shack and Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse received multi-million dollar loans, while small businesses, which the program was created to support, were hung out to dry. In early June, a bill overhauled the original program as it was written, changing the loan amount restaurants would have to spend on payroll (from 75 percent to 60 percent), and extending the period of time recipients could use the funds, as well as the timeline in which they would have to hire workers back (both were extended from June to December). Those changes were designed to make the loans more reasonable for truly small businesses.

But instead of being depleted, the loan program has “stalled” since May, according to the Washington Post, so that by June 20, $128 billion was still available. Loans that were returned, along with accidental duplicate loans that were cancelled, totaled $38.5 billion by the end of the month. By no means does the current surplus mean restaurant owners have secured the funds they need to weather the COVID-19 crisis; it only points out the program’s inability to distribute loans to those who desperately need them. Among those that have struggled most to secure loans since the economic downturn are Black restaurant owners, who already faced disproportionate challenges and hurdles when attempting to secure funding for their businesses before the pandemic. Even as money was returned in May, Black and Latino restaurant owners continued to have difficulty accessing resources, and the loans they were granted were almost always lower than the ones they requested, according to a study done by the Global Strategy Group.

The loan program likely wouldn’t have stalled — or at least, not so dramatically — if more resources had been put into reaching and supporting communities that have historically been ignored and avoided by major banks and lenders. Instead, these businesses were left to fend for themselves.

So what’s next, when $130 billion is on the line? Lawmakers have expressed intent to tap into the remaining funds, and make further assistance available. On June 18, Senators Ben Cardin, Chris Coons, and Jeanne Shaheen introduced the Prioritized Paycheck Protection Program (P4) Act, which would extend the loan application deadline until December 30, and open new lending for businesses with 100 employees or less, that have exhausted their initial PPP loans. The bill would “provide eligible small businesses with as much as 250 percent of monthly payroll costs.” A portion of funding would be reserved for businesses with 10 employees or fewer, and “small businesses in underserved and rural communities.” On June 24, Coons told Yahoo Finance that he was working on getting a Republican co-sponsor on the bill. Its current status is unclear.

That bill is unrelated to the Real Economic Support That Acknowledges Unique Restaurant Assistance Needed to Survive (RESTAURANTS) Act of 2020, which would allocate $120 billion to assist independent restaurants and has bipartisan support.

With the PPP loan application cutoff tomorrow, and a plan for the remaining funds unclear, business owners are left wondering what will become of the money that hasn’t been distributed. Will another round of funding reach restaurant owners who have yet to see any support? Or will the restaurants that most need assistance continue to struggle and close, as more than $100 billion returns to the Treasury?","        Skip to main content     Cookie banner  We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audiences come from.

https://www.epi.org/blog/nearly-11-of-the-workforce-is-out-of-work-with-zero-chance-of-getting-called-back-to-a-prior-job/,"In May, the official unemployment rate was 13.3%. However, the unemployment rate that takes into account all those who are out of work as a result of the virus was 19.7%, and the unemployment rate that includes only those who are out of work and don’t have a reasonable chance of being called back to a prior job was 10.7%. The official unemployment rate was 13.3% in May. However, if you consider not just the 21.0 million officially unemployed, but all 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work as a result of the virus, that jumps to 19.7%. That is nearly one in five workers. Of the 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work because of the virus, 11.9 million workers, or 7.2% of the workforce, are out of work with no hope of being called back to a prior job; 5.7 million workers, or 3.5% of the workforce, are out of work and expect to get called back to a prior job but likely will not; and 14.8 million workers, or 9.0% of the workforce, are out of work and can reasonably expect to be called back. That means the share of the workforce that is out of work and has no reasonable chance of being called back to a prior job is 10.7% (7.2% + 3.5%).

All three of these unemployment rates are extremely elevated across all demographic groups. However, the highest rates are found among Black and brown workers, women, and particularly Hispanic, Asian, and Black women. Young workers and workers with lower levels of education have also been hit disproportionately hard.

It is important to note that the prospect of even those who can reasonably expect to be called back to a prior job actually getting called back will require Congress to act. For example, if Congress doesn’t extend the extra $600 in weekly unemployment insurance payments, that will cost us 5.1 million jobs over the next year, and if it doesn’t provide fiscal aid to state and local governments to fill in their budget shortfalls, it will cost another 5.3 million jobs by the end of 2021. Key takeaways: In May, the unemployment rate declined to 13.3% from 14.7% in April. That improvement was welcome news, but aside from April, the 13.3% unemployment rate in May was higher than anything we’ve seen since the Great Depression. And, the unemployment rate is not reflecting all coronavirus-related job losses. In May, 21 million workers were counted as officially unemployed. But there were another 4.9 million workers who were out of work because of the virus but who were being misclassified—they had been furloughed and should have been counted as unemployed and on temporary layoff, but were instead counted as “employed but not at work.” If those workers had been correctly counted as being on furlough instead of employed, the unemployment rate would have been 16.4% in May instead of 13.3%. (This misclassification has gotten a lot of attention, with some suggesting that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is cooking the books. That is not the case; BLS was extremely transparent and consistent with their treatment of the data.) Another group of workers who are left out of the official unemployment rate are those who are out of work as a result of the virus but are not actively seeking work. As is always the case, for a jobless worker who is not on furlough to be counted as unemployed, they must be actively seeking work. Today, that remains impossible for many. I estimate that in May, there were 6.6 million workers who were out of work as a result of the virus but who were being counted as dropping out of the labor force because they weren’t actively seeking work. I arrive at that figure by assuming that the February labor force participation rate (63.4%) is what the May labor force participation rate (LFPR) would have been if the pandemic had not occurred. (Note, this is likely somewhat understating what the LFPR would have been in May without the pandemic since the LFPR had been rising slightly in the year prior to the virus—from 63.1% in February 2019 to 63.4% in February 2020.) Then I multiply the February 2020 LFPR by the May population (age 16+) to estimate what the size of the labor force would have been in May if the coronavirus hadn’t happened, yielding 164.8 million. I then subtract from that the actual May labor force, 158.2 million. The result, 6.6 million, is the number of workers who would have been in the labor force in May if the pandemic hadn’t happened, but, instead, are out of work and not actively seeking work. Putting that all together—the 21.0 million officially unemployed, the 4.9 million unemployed who are being misclassified as “employed, not at work,” and the 6.6 million who have dropped out of the labor force as a result of the virus—that’s 32.5 million workers who are officially unemployed or are otherwise out of work as a result of the virus. If they had all shown up as unemployed, the unemployment rate would have been 19.7% in May instead of 13.3%. That’s an improvement from the same figure in April, which was 23.5%, but it is still mind-bogglingly high—nearly one in five workers are out of work. The following chart provides these two unemployment rates—the official rate and the rate that takes into account the officially unemployed and others who are out of work as a result of the virus—by gender, race/ethnicity, education, and age. The rates are incredibly high across the board, but job losses have been particularly stark among Black and brown workers. Historically higher unemployment rates and lower liquid savings make job losses even more devastating for Black workers and their families. Unemployment rates in May were also extremely high among women, and especially Hispanic, Asian, and Black women. Furthermore, the unemployment rate is higher for workers with lower levels of educational attainment, though even among those with advanced degrees, nearly one in 10 are either unemployed or out of work as a result of the virus. The figure also shows that young people have been hit especially hard in this pandemic recession, with more than a third of 16–23 year-olds either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work as a result of the virus. Those graduating right now are in a particularly difficult situation, as they are experiencing extremely limited job opportunities but do not qualify for unemployment insurance, even under the expansive definitions of the CARES Act. Congress should institute a Jobseeker’s Allowance to address this issue.

The demographic breakdowns are based on EPI’s analysis of Current Population Survey microdata and are not seasonally adjusted and therefore they will not match the seasonally adjusted numbers published by BLS.

Download image Some are saying that because rehiring took place in May and the unemployment rate improved, perhaps more aid from Congress isn’t needed because workers will just return to their old jobs. This logic could not be more misguided. Of the 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work because of the virus, only 14.8 million workers (or 45.6%) can reasonably expect to be called back to a prior job, which means 17.6 million (or 54.4%) cannot. That calculation is the result of the following steps: The survey the unemployment data are from asks unemployed workers who lost a job if they expect to return to work. Of the 21.0 million officially unemployed in May, 15.3 million expect to be called back to their old job, which means 5.6 million of the officially unemployed do not expect to be recalled to a former job (numbers don’t sum to the total due to rounding). Further, I assume that all of the 4.9 million unemployed who are being misclassified as “employed, not at work” expect to be called back to their old job, and that none of the 6.6 million who have dropped out of the labor force as a result of the virus expect to be called back. That means that of the 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work because of the virus, 20.2 million expect to be called back, and 12.2 million do not. However, it is likely that many of those who expect to be called back to their jobs will find that those furloughs have turned into permanent layoffs. First, BLS adopted an unusually broad definition of temporary layoff with respect to the coronavirus. Typically, to be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, a person has to either have been given a date to return to work by their employer or expect to be recalled to their job within 6 months. However, if an unemployed person expects to be recalled to their job but, because of the coronavirus, they are not sure whether they will be recalled within six months, their response was counted as a “yes” (they expect to be called back within six months), rather than “don’t know.” BLS reports that “this unusual step was taken as part of an attempt to classify people who were effectively laid off due to pandemic-related closures among the unemployed on temporary layoff.” (See Question 8 here.) Further, it is likely that many workers who were explicitly told they would be called back will ultimately find that their temporary layoff was actually a permanent layoff. Businesses may have told the workers they were laying off that they were going to call them back even if they were unsure they would be able to, because it was an easier message to deliver. Or, businesses may have felt confident that they were going to call back their workers at the time of the job separation, but underestimated the financial strain they would face and will end up either going out of businesses or only needing to call back a fraction of the workers they furloughed. Historically, only 71.7% of workers on temporary furlough return to their jobs. On the other hand, 13.4% of laid-off workers who expect that their layoff is permanent are actually recalled. (These shares are found in Table II and the surrounding discussion in a 1990 paper by Larry Katz and Bruce Meyer, “Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations, and Unemployment Outcomes.”) It is unclear the extent to which this historic experience will be applicable in the current crisis, but these estimates nevertheless provide a rough sense of what we might expect. BLS data show that 2.3 million unemployed workers report being permanently laid off (unemployed workers who were not on temporary layoff but, for example, were not laid off because they are new entrants or reentrants to the labor market, or they voluntarily quit their job, are not included in this figure). If 13.4% of the 2.3 million unemployed workers who report being permanently laid off are in fact recalled, that is 308,000 workers who thought they were permanently laid off who will ultimately be recalled. Subtracting 308,000 from the 12.2 million calculated in step 1 that do not expect to be called back to a prior job yields 11.9 million workers who have essentially zero chance of being called back. If, as described in the prior step, only 71.7% of workers who do expect to be called back are called back, that means 28.3% will not be called back even though they expect to. That in turn would imply that of the 20.2 million workers who are out of work but expect to be called back to their prior job, 5.7 million will not be called back, and 14.5 million will. Adding to that 14.5 million the 308,000 workers calculated in the previous step who thought they were permanently laid off who are likely to get recalled, that is 14.8 million workers who can reasonably expect to be called back. Putting this all together means that of the 164.8 million workers who are either in the labor force or who have dropped out of the labor force as a result of the virus, 11.9 million workers, or 7.2%, are out of work with no hope of being called back to a prior job; 5.7 million workers, or 3.5%, expect to get called back to work but likely will not; and 14.8 million workers, or 9.0%, may reasonably expect to be called back. In other words, even if all workers who can reasonably expect to be called back to their prior jobs were called back, the share of the workforce out of work would still be 10.7% (7.2% plus 3.5%), higher than the highest unemployment rate of the Great Recession. The following chart provides, overall and by demographic, the breakdown from step 4 (namely, the share of the workforce that is out of work with no chance of being called back to a prior job, the share of the workforce that is out of work and expects to get called back to their prior job but likely will not, and the share of the workforce that is out of work and can reasonably expect to be called back). The sum of the first two segments in each bar is the share of the workforce that is out of work and has no reasonable expectation of being called back to work. Overall, that figure is 10.7%, and is extremely high across the board, but it is particularly high among Black and brown workers, women, and especially Hispanic, Asian, and Black women. It is also particularly high among young workers and among workers with low levels of education.

Download image It’s worth noting that the prospect of even those who can reasonably expect to be called back to a prior job actually getting called back will require Congress to act. If Congress provides enough aid to state and local governments, individuals, and businesses so that confidence and demand are high as the economy reopens, and puts in place public health measures and child care measures that make a successful reopening possible, then those furloughed workers will likely be needed by their former employers to meet demand, and will be called back. But if not, many won’t, and we will face sustained, extremely high unemployment. Congress needs to extend the unemployment provisions in the CARES Act, including extending the across-the-board $600 increase in weekly benefits. Opponents of the policy say that the extra benefits disincentivize people from returning to work. However, cutting off the extra money so that people must exist on our very stingy regular state benefits will not work to incentivize people to return to work when safe jobs aren’t available. Instead, what we will see is millions who can’t find work being forced to dramatically cut back their spending. That will not only cause an enormous amount of human suffering, but it will also hamstring the recovery. We estimate that allowing the $600 to expire at the end of July will cost us 5.1 million jobs over the next year. We must also provide a huge amount of aid to state and local governments. Without it, the recovery from this recession will be delayed for years. We estimate that state and local governments face budget shortfalls on the order of $1 trillion by the end of 2021 and if the federal government doesn’t fill that in, it will cost 5.3 million jobs—in both the public and private sector—by the end of 2021. And we can’t turn off federal relief too early. The expiration of relief provisions should be tied to economic conditions. Assigning arbitrary end dates to provisions to sustain the economy makes no sense when we could easily have provisions phase out as the unemployment rate or the employment-to-population ratio are restored to near pre-virus levels. Using automatic stabilizers would not be any more expensive than the cumulative cost of multiple extensions—but it would prevent destructive lapses in critical programs while Congress negotiates extensions, and it would alleviate corrosive uncertainty by giving businesses, states, localities, and households confidence around budgeting and planning. And if projections are wrong and jobs roar back until we are at near pre-recession levels much more quickly than expected? That would be great news, and with automatic stabilizers, aid would simply turn off because it would no longer be needed.","                                         About   About EPI  Events  Newsroom  Careers  Staff  Board of Directors  Newsletter  Contact Us  Why Give to EPI  Donate    Areas of Research   View all  Coronavirus Pandemic  Budget, Taxes and Public Investment  Economic Growth  Education  Health  Immigration  Inequality and Poverty  Jobs and Unemployment  Minimum Wage  Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy  Regulation  Retirement  Trade and Globalization  Unions and Labor Standards  Wages, Incomes and Wealth    Publications  Experts  Resources   View all  Data Library  Economic Indicators   Jobs and Unemployment  State Jobs and Unemployment  State Unemployment by Race and Ethnicity  JOLTS  Minimum Wage Tracker  Nominal Wage Tracker  GDP  Income & Poverty  Productivity–Pay Gap    Family Budget Calculator  Policy Agenda  Tax & spending explorer  Multimedia  State of Working America  Economic Analysis and Research Network (EARN)  Bookstore  Projects   State of Working America  Inequality.is  Building Worker Power      Blog  Donate         Working Economics Blog        Posted				June 29, 2020 at 3:45 pm by Heidi Shierholz   Nearly 11% of the workforce is out of work with no reasonable chance of getting called back to a prior job          Key takeaways:   In May, the official unemployment rate was 13.3%. However, the unemployment rate that takes into account all those who are out of work as a result of the virus was 19.7%, and the unemployment rate that includes only those who are out of work and don’t have a reasonable chance of being called back to a prior job was 10.7%.  The official unemployment rate was 13.3% in May. However, if you consider not just the 21.0 million officially unemployed, but all 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work as a result of the virus, that jumps to 19.7%. That is nearly one in five workers.  Of the 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work because of the virus, 11.9 million workers, or 7.2% of the workforce, are out of work with no hope of being called back to a prior job; 5.7 million workers, or 3.5% of the workforce, are out of work and expect to get called back to a prior job but likely will not; and 14.8 million workers, or 9.0% of the workforce, are out of work and can reasonably expect to be called back. That means the share of the workforce that is out of work and has no reasonable chance of being called back to a prior job is 10.7% (7.2% + 3.5%).    All three of these unemployment rates are extremely elevated across all demographic groups. However, the highest rates are found among Black and brown workers, women, and particularly Hispanic, Asian, and Black women. Young workers and workers with lower levels of education have also been hit disproportionately hard.  It is important to note that the prospect of even those who can reasonably expect to be called back to a prior job actually getting called back will require Congress to act. For example, if Congress doesn’t extend the extra $600 in weekly unemployment insurance payments, that will cost us 5.1 million jobs over the next year, and if it doesn’t provide fiscal aid to state and local governments to fill in their budget shortfalls, it will cost another 5.3 million jobs by the end of 2021. In May, the unemployment rate declined to 13.3% from 14.7% in April. That improvement was welcome news, but aside from April, the 13.3% unemployment rate in May was higher than anything we’ve seen since the Great Depression. And, the unemployment rate is not reflecting all coronavirus-related job losses. In May, 21 million workers were counted as officially unemployed. But there were another 4.9 million workers who were out of work because of the virus but who were being misclassified—they had been furloughed and should have been counted as unemployed and on temporary layoff, but were instead counted as “employed but not at work.” If those workers had been correctly counted as being on furlough instead of employed, the unemployment rate would have been 16.4% in May instead of 13.3%. (This misclassification has gotten a lot of attention, with some suggesting that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is cooking the books. That is not the case; BLS was extremely transparent and consistent with their treatment of the data.) Another group of workers who are left out of the official unemployment rate are those who are out of work as a result of the virus but are not actively seeking work. As is always the case, for a jobless worker who is not on furlough to be counted as unemployed, they must be actively seeking work. Today, that remains impossible for many. I estimate that in May, there were 6.6 million workers who were out of work as a result of the virus but who were being counted as dropping out of the labor force because they weren’t actively seeking work. I arrive at that figure by assuming that the February labor force participation rate (63.4%) is what the May labor force participation rate (LFPR) would have been if the pandemic had not occurred. (Note, this is likely somewhat understating what the LFPR would have been in May without the pandemic since the LFPR had been rising slightly in the year prior to the virus—from 63.1% in February 2019 to 63.4% in February 2020.) Then I multiply the February 2020 LFPR by the May population (age 16+) to estimate what the size of the labor force would have been in May if the coronavirus hadn’t happened, yielding 164.8 million. I then subtract from that the actual May labor force, 158.2 million. The result, 6.6 million, is the number of workers who would have been in the labor force in May if the pandemic hadn’t happened, but, instead, are out of work and not actively seeking work. Putting that all together—the 21.0 million officially unemployed, the 4.9 million unemployed who are being misclassified as “employed, not at work,” and the 6.6 million who have dropped out of the labor force as a result of the virus—that’s 32.5 million workers who are officially unemployed or are otherwise out of work as a result of the virus. If they had all shown up as unemployed, the unemployment rate would have been 19.7% in May instead of 13.3%. That’s an improvement from the same figure in April, which was 23.5%, but it is still mind-bogglingly high—nearly one in five workers are out of work. The following chart provides these two unemployment rates—the official rate and the rate that takes into account the officially unemployed and others who are out of work as a result of the virus—by gender, race/ethnicity, education, and age. The rates are incredibly high across the board, but job losses have been particularly stark among Black and brown workers. Historically higher unemployment rates and lower liquid savings make job losses even more devastating for Black workers and their families. Unemployment rates in May were also extremely high among women, and especially Hispanic, Asian, and Black women. Furthermore, the unemployment rate is higher for workers with lower levels of educational attainment, though even among those with advanced degrees, nearly one in 10 are either unemployed or out of work as a result of the virus. The figure also shows that young people have been hit especially hard in this pandemic recession, with more than a third of 16–23 year-olds either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work as a result of the virus. Those graduating right now are in a particularly difficult situation, as they are experiencing extremely limited job opportunities but do not qualify for unemployment insurance, even under the expansive definitions of the CARES Act. Congress should institute a Jobseeker’s Allowance to address this issue.

Download image Some are saying that because rehiring took place in May and the unemployment rate improved, perhaps more aid from Congress isn’t needed because workers will just return to their old jobs. This logic could not be more misguided. Of the 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work because of the virus, only 14.8 million workers (or 45.6%) can reasonably expect to be called back to a prior job, which means 17.6 million (or 54.4%) cannot. That calculation is the result of the following steps:  The survey the unemployment data are from asks unemployed workers who lost a job if they expect to return to work. Of the 21.0 million officially unemployed in May, 15.3 million expect to be called back to their old job, which means 5.6 million of the officially unemployed do not expect to be recalled to a former job (numbers don’t sum to the total due to rounding). Further, I assume that all of the 4.9 million unemployed who are being misclassified as “employed, not at work” expect to be called back to their old job, and that none of the 6.6 million who have dropped out of the labor force as a result of the virus expect to be called back. That means that of the 32.5 million workers who are either officially unemployed or otherwise out of work because of the virus, 20.2 million expect to be called back, and 12.2 million do not.  However, it is likely that many of those who expect to be called back to their jobs will find that those furloughs have turned into permanent layoffs. First, BLS adopted an unusually broad definition of temporary layoff with respect to the coronavirus. Typically, to be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, a person has to either have been given a date to return to work by their employer or expect to be recalled to their job within 6 months. However, if an unemployed person expects to be recalled to their job but, because of the coronavirus , they are not sure whether they will be recalled within six months, their response was counted as a “yes” (they expect to be called back within six months), rather than “don’t know.” BLS reports that “this unusual step was taken as part of an attempt to classify people who were effectively laid off due to pandemic-related closures among the unemployed on temporary layoff.” (See Question 8 here .)

Businesses may have told the workers they were laying off that they were going to call them back even if they were unsure they would be able to, because it was an easier message to deliver. Or, businesses may have felt confident that they were going to call back their workers at the time of the job separation, but underestimated the financial strain they would face and will end up either going out of businesses or only needing to call back a fraction of the workers they furloughed. Historically, only 71.7% of workers on temporary furlough return to their jobs. On the other hand, 13.4% of laid-off workers who expect that their layoff is permanent are actually recalled. (These shares are found in Table II and the surrounding discussion in a 1990 paper by Larry Katz and Bruce Meyer, “ Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations, and Unemployment Outcomes .”) It is unclear the extent to which this historic experience will be applicable in the current crisis, but these estimates nevertheless provide a rough sense of what we might expect.

If 13.4% of the 2.3 million unemployed workers who report being permanently laid off are in fact recalled, that is 308,000 workers who thought they were permanently laid off who will ultimately be recalled. Subtracting 308,000 from the 12.2 million calculated in step 1 that do not expect to be called back to a prior job yields 11.9 million workers who have essentially zero chance of being called back.

Using automatic stabilizers would not be any more expensive than the cumulative cost of multiple extensions—but it would prevent destructive lapses in critical programs while Congress negotiates extensions, and it would alleviate corrosive uncertainty by giving businesses, states, localities, and households confidence around budgeting and planning. And if projections are wrong and jobs roar back until we are at near pre-recession levels much more quickly than expected? That would be great news, and with automatic stabilizers, aid would simply turn off because it would no longer be needed.

https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/look-out-below-why-economy-about-fly-fiscal-cliff,"One look at the latest economic data, conveniently summarized by the exploding Citi US econ surprise index, should be sufficient to convince most that the US is well and truly following a V-shaped recovery path.

Alas, nothing could be further from the truth because the current economic sugar rush is almost entirely a function of the massive government spending spree, a spree which in just over a month will be effectively over. As a result, as Bank of America writes, the economy is facing fiscal cliffs which could cause the recovery to disintegrate, with four particular areas of focus:

expiration of extended unemployment insurance, the fading support from stimulus checks, exhaustion of PPP stress from state and local aid gov'ts.

In response, BofA expects another stimulus bill to be passed in late July to address some - but not all - of these concerns, and ""instead of a cliff, we will likely be facing a hill."" That may be optimistic, because any stimulus would need to be bipartisan, and if the Democrats wish to crush Trump's re-election chances, now is the time for them to push the economy into a depression with elections in just 4 months.

Will they do it? We'll know in a few weeks, and certainly once the July 31 benefits cliff hits.

Until then, here is BofA on the likely fiscal cliff outcomes:

Fiscal: look out below

In the face of the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal stimulus has poured into the economy. Washington has pushed in roughly $2.8tr of stimulus, equaling 13% of GDP while the Fed has expanded its balance sheet to $7.1tr. The rapid and forceful support on the policy front likely limited the downside during the recession and has helped to support the ongoing recovery. But we are now approaching a few ""cliffs"" which would prove painful if unaddressed. We see four areas of concern:

Unemployment insurance (UI): the incremental $600/week is set to expire on July 31st. To put some numbers around this, at the current level of nearly 20 million people receiving unemployment insurance this would equate to a reduction in personal income of $48bn ($576bn annualized) or 2.7% of GDP.

the incremental $600/week is set to expire on July 31st. To put some numbers around this, at the current level of nearly 20 million people receiving unemployment insurance Stimulus checks are no longer rolling in: the majority of the tax rebates / checks were distributed in mid/late April. To date, around $270bn of the $290bn has been pumped in. We find that consumers quickly spent the additional cash which means a diminishing support to spending.

the majority of the tax rebates / checks were distributed in mid/late April. To date, around $270bn of the $290bn has been pumped in. We find that consumers quickly spent the additional cash which means a diminishing support to spending. Payroll Protection Program (PPP): of the $670bn allocated to the PPP, around 77% has been approved. The new legislation allows small businesses until the end of the year to allocate the funds (vs end of June previously) which prolongs the support from the program. However, the magnitude of the support is lessened given that the size of the program has not changed and it was initially designed to help small businesses get through a shock lasting roughly two months.

However, the magnitude of the support is lessened given that the size of the program has not changed and it was initially designed to help small businesses get through a shock lasting roughly two months. State & local aid: the CARES Act allocated $150bn to state & local governments to be used for unexpected coronavirus-related costs. But this did not address the revenue shock state and local governments have experienced. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), 29 states and DC expect FY 2021 general fund revenues to be lower than their pre-COVID projections. Without aid, these governments will be forced to make further cuts to employment and services.

Quantifying the impact

In Table 1, BofA groups the stimulus programs to date into major sectors. About 23% of the funds have been directed toward households to offset the significant strain on household incomes from massive job cuts. Moreover, if you include the required wage portion of the PPP loans, the household share of stimulus is over 40% of funds.

The good news is that these measures have worked. Personal income jumped 10.5% mom SA in April. An $879bn annualized decline in compensation was offset by a $2,999bn increase in transfer payments, of which $361bn was from unemployment insurance. Given that PPP was first getting underway in April BofA assumes it had little/no impact on labor income in April. If one nets out the boost from stimulus checks and unemployment insurance, personal income would have declined by 5.6% mom SA in April vs. the 10.5% reported increase.

In line with expectations, and the fading of a fiscal impulse, last Friday we observed a sizeable decline in personal income given that the boost from stimulus checks declined substantially compared to April. Looking ahead to June, BofA expects another drop in income as people shift back into the labor market from unemployment insurance. Given that the majority of those on unemployment insurance earned more from benefits than when they were working, the move back to employed will actually be a net negative for overall income. Indeed a recent paper (Ganong et al. 2020) found that roughly two-thirds of UI recipients are earning more than their lost wages.

The big question is what happens in August?

This will be the first month following the ""cliff"". The current law calls for the additional $600/week to expire. Based on BofA's forecast for the labor market, continuing claims in August could still be running around 16mn, up by nearly 15mn from the pre-COVID February levels. Assuming it is 16mn, the loss of the $600/week benefit would translate into roughly a $36bn drop in income in August, or a 2.3% mom decline.

The Payroll Protection Program (PPP) has also underpinned labor income. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved $516bn in PPP loans. Under previous rules, 75% of those funds had to go to payrolls over an 8 week period in order for the loan to be forgiven. As such, this would translate to $387bn in support for labor income, mostly in May and June. The law has since been amended such that businesses only need to use 60% of the funds for payroll costs over a 24 week period. However, no changes were made to the maximum size of the loan, which is the lesser of $10mn or 2.5x 2019 average monthly payrolls. While the changes will help businesses stay afloat as they deal with reduced demand, it also means that the support for labor income has been substantially reduced and spread out.

From income to spending

Clearly there has been a significant boost to personal income from stimulus. But now it is time to consider how this filters into the real economy via consumer spending. The biggest jolt to spending likely came from the stimulus checks. A paper from the Chicago Fed (Karger et al. 2020) found that in the two weeks after households received their stimulus check, they spent roughly 48% of it. Then spending fell back to normal levels. Based on analysis with aggregated BAC card data, the bank similarly found that the bulk of the incremental spending from the stimulus checks occurred over a 5-day period following receipt of the money.

Meanwhile, the path of consumer spending will be impacted by the trajectory for unemployment insurance. A paper from Ganong found that spending on nondurables declined by less than 1% while people were receiving UI, but at exhaustion dropped by 12%. Not extending the program would mean a 2.3% decline in personal income in August. Given the high propensity to consume out of unemployment insurance this would be a similarly sized hit to consumer spending in August.

However, by extending the program, the unemployment rate is also likely to be stickier as people have an incentive to stay out of work. Indeed, a recent analysis from the CBO found that if the program was extended as is through the end of the year then 5 out of 6 recipients would earn more on unemployment than they would if they were to return to work. They estimate that while this may boost GDP this year it would be a drag on growth next year. If the program was instead allowed to expire, presumably the unemployment rate would fall faster and more people would return to work. However, even with greater engagement in the labor market, income would still decline given that unemployment insurance is more generous and many workers will find challenges returning to the workforce.

The state and local stress

In addition to the impending ""cliff"" for household income, many state and local governments are facing a concerning revenue outlook as they move closer to the start of FY 2021. According to CBPP (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities), initial estimates of the revenue impact from the COVID-shock indicate that state revenue could drop in FY 2021 by more than it did during the Great Recession. States will be forced to tap into their rainy day funds first before ultimately making cuts to spending to offset the revenue shortfalls, as they are required to balance their budgets. Indeed, governors in Ohio, New Jersey and Georgia have already asked state agencies to prepare for sizeable cuts to spending. Indeed state & local government have already started to cut jobs - in the April and May employment report, state and local governments shed nearly 1.6mn workers.

Congress to take action in late July/early August

Republicans and Democrats are at odds over whether to extend the expanded unemployment insurance program for obvious reasons. The Democrats in Congress generally advocate for a full extension as was passed in the HEROES Act but Republicans are resisting, arguing that the generosity of the program has discouraged a return to work. A middle ground may be a smaller dollar amount (perhaps $250-300/ week) with back-to-work bonuses that will create an incentive to return to the workforce.

On state & local aid, the HEROES Act called for close to $1tr in relief. While this number is unlikely in our view, a bipartisan bill proposed by Senator Cassidy (R-LA) and Senator Menendez (R-NJ) proposed in May would allocate $500bn in aid to state and local governments. The ultimate number will likely be nearer to that number than the amount from the HEROES act.

There has also been some talk of another round of stimulus checks with President Trump affirming ""Yeah, we are"" [going to do another stimulus check], and White House Economic advisor Larry Kudlow saying that a second round would likely happen but be more targeted. While this also showed up in the Dem's HEROES Act, some Republicans in the Senate (Sen. Toomey (R-PA) and Sen. Cornyn (R-TX)) have voiced opposition to another round recently. Republicans have generally raised concerns that stimulus checks are not the most efficient way to target those who are most in need.

The White House has also been calling for other measures such as a payroll tax cut and an infrastructure package, although neither of these are likely as the payroll tax cut would only help those who still have a job while an infrastructure bill is unlikely to be tackled until after the election.

In summary, after July 31 the US economy is set to fly off a fiscal cliff that could be just as painful as what happened in late March/April unless there is a bipartisan agreement in Congress on trillions more in fiscal stimulus.

MADISON —Carol Glupker’s blood pressure spiked to dangerously high levels last week, so high she had to go to the Emergency Room.

The 60-year-old Milwaukee woman said she had never had high blood pressure before her three-month-plus misadventure in a dysfunctional state unemployment insurance system.

“Now I’m going to have to go on high blood pressure medicine because I can’t sleep at night,” she told Wisconsin Spotlight last week.

On Friday, Glupker said she had $40 in her checkbook before the $25 cost of her new meds. She’s financially depleted, like thousands of her fellow Wisconsinites who have gone months without the unemployment benefits they’ve applied for.

98 days and counting

Glupker’s story is sadly all too familiar. In March, the pandemic and Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide lockdown left her out of two jobs. She worked about 15 hours a week in Medicare insurance sales, and 15 to 20 hours at a Milwaukee supper club.

She filed her first unemployment claim on March 23. A benefits specialist at the state Department of Workforce Development told Glupker to fax in some information to the office. The only other contact from the agency was a questionnaire sent to the displaced worker on April 14.

Glupker said she heard nothing from DWD, despite her many efforts to reach someone, until nearly a month later. Finally, on May 15, Glupker said DWD denied her claim. The agency claimed she quit her insurance job. She didn’t.

A day before, her boss faxed — again with the faxing — into DWD a letter to “clear up a misunderstanding” about his employee.

…”I had to make the decision to LAY HER OFF. She did not QUIT her employment with me,” the employer wrote with emphasis.

He said he wanted Glupker to come into the office located in his home after Evers issued his Safer at Home order, but Glupker, concerned about COVID-19, told her employer that she wanted to work from home, the letter states.

“Once things open up I hope I can bring her back to work,” the employer wrote.

So why was Glupker denied? Why isn’t she receiving benefits after losing her job when the supper club shut down? DWD didn’t tell her.

She has appealed.

Bureaucratic shuffle

A DWD agent did tell her originally to apply for federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which has provided millions of Americans (that governments have forced out of work) with a minimum $600 monthly — on top of their traditional Unemployment Insurance.

Glupker filed for PUA on May 15. She was finally contacted by a DWD agent more than a month later.

“She said, ‘You weren’t supposed to apply for that. We won’t look at your case until your appeal is completed.’ Then they told me that I would need to send in all of my W2s and pay stubs and that it would be at least another 45 days,” Glupker said.

So that’s another month-and-half on top of more than three months without a dime in help from an agency that recently reported north of 151,000 individual claimants were still waiting for unemployment benefits or an administrative decision from DWD. Some 860,000 jobless claims had yet to be paid.

“It’s just crazy. It’s absolutely crazy,” Glupker said.

She reached out to U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner’s office. A constituent services official for the Menomonee Falls congressman told Glupker the program is funded through federal tax dollars but it’s administered by the state.

So, back to the broken DWD Unemployment Insurance division.

She reached out to the office of state Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield). She said staff there have been very helpful but can only do so much. She called Evers’ office. Someone there said he’d work on her problem and get back to her. More than a week later, nothing, Glupker said.

Desperation is setting in.

‘Nothing left’

“Me, as an individual, I live by myself. I have no money coming in,” Glupker said. “I have depleted all of my savings account, all my 401(k). I have nothing left anymore.”

As she waits for DWD to figure out what it’s doing, the clock on Glupker’s mortgage reprieve is ticking. Her first-time-homebuyer loan allows her to forgo mortgage payments for up to six months. Come September, all those delayed monthly payments — $6,000-worth — will come due, she said.

“How do I come up with that money?” she said.

Thankfully, the restaurant has reopened. But Milwaukee’s restrictive COVID-19 health order had only allowed 25 percent capacity. That means fewer employees are needed. The supper club owners have tried to provide workers with at least a couple of shifts each. It’s not much, but it’s something, Glupker said.

And the Milwaukee woman says she’s ready and willing to work. She even applied for a job at the Department of Workforce Development. With her background in insurance and human resources, Glupker said she knows DWD could desperately use the help.

“I’m a worker I’m a really really hard hard worker,” she said. “I would work if I could. I’m not trying to game the system.”

On vacation

Meanwhile, the big government incompetence at the agency is stunning.

Glupker said a friend dealing with the same unemployment struggles was told by a DWD agent that he would try to get her claims processed before he went on vacation. He wasn’t making any promises. He said he wouldn’t be back in the office until July 7.

“Why are you even telling people that?” she said. “‘It’s going to be another two weeks before you get any money because you’re not important enough.’ That’s what I hear.”

In another case, an unemployed Uber driver was instructed to mail DWD a package of documents. She overnighted the package, which cost her $40. DWD said they hadn’t received the package and told the claimant to send it again. Another $40.

“That’s food on someone’s table. She couldn’t have emailed it?” Glupker said. Apparently not, but there’s a whole lot of mailing and faxing going on at DWD in the Digital Age.

DWD leadership has blamed the Unemployment Insurance debacle on an outdated integrated technology system that the Republican-led Legislature could have paid to fix a long time ago. But the myriad complaints from frustrated claimants mostly have to do with procedure problems, leadership problems, people problems.

And for a lot of people who have gone months without help or hope from a dysfunctional state agency, the problems are getting worse.

				Updated   Left with nothing  By M.D. Kittle      Wisconsin Spotlight | June 29, 2020  MADISON —Carol Glupker’s blood pressure spiked to dangerously high levels last week, so high she had to go to the Emergency Room.   The 60-year-old Milwaukee woman said she had never had high blood pressure before her three-month-plus misadventure in a dysfunctional state unemployment insurance system.   “Now I’m going to have to go on high blood pressure medicine because I can’t sleep at night,” she told Wisconsin Spotlight last week.   On Friday, Glupker said she had $40 in her checkbook before the $25 cost of her new meds. She’s financially depleted, like thousands of her fellow Wisconsinites who have gone months without the unemployment benefits they’ve applied for.   98 days and counting   Glupker’s story is sadly all too familiar. In March, the pandemic and Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide lockdown left her out of two jobs. She worked about 15 hours a week in Medicare insurance sales, and 15 to 20 hours at a Milwaukee supper club.   She filed her first unemployment claim on March 23. A benefits specialist at the state Department of Workforce Development told Glupker to fax in some information to the office. The only other contact from the agency was a questionnaire sent to the displaced worker on April 14.   Glupker said she heard nothing from DWD, despite her many efforts to reach someone, until nearly a month later. Finally, on May 15, Glupker said DWD denied her claim. The agency claimed she quit her insurance job. She didn’t.   A day before, her boss faxed — again with the faxing — into DWD a letter to “clear up a misunderstanding” about his employee.   …”I had to make the decision to LAY HER OFF. She did not QUIT her employment with me,” the employer wrote with emphasis.   He said he wanted Glupker to come into the office located in his home after Evers issued his Safer at Home order, but Glupker, concerned about COVID-19, told her employer that she wanted to work from home, the letter states.   “Once things open up I hope I can bring her back to work,” the employer wrote.   So why was Glupker denied? Why isn’t she receiving benefits after losing her job when the supper club shut down? DWD didn’t tell her.   She has appealed.  Bureaucratic shuffle  A DWD agent did tell her originally to apply for federal  Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which has provided millions of Americans (that governments have forced out of work) with a minimum $600 monthly — on top of their traditional Unemployment Insurance.   Glupker filed for PUA on May 15. She was finally contacted by a DWD agent more than a month later.   “She said, ‘You weren’t supposed to apply for that. We won’t look at your case until your appeal is completed.’ Then they told me that I would need to send in all of my W2s and pay stubs and that it would be at least another 45 days,” Glupker said.   So that’s another month-and-half on top of more than three months without a dime in help from an agency that r ecently reported north of 151,000 individual claimants were still waiting for unemployment benefits or an administrative decision from DWD. Some 860,000 jobless claims had yet to be paid.   “It’s just crazy. It’s absolutely crazy,” Glupker said.   She reached out to U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner’s office. A constituent services official for the Menomonee Falls congressman told Glupker the program is funded through federal tax dollars but it’s administered by the state.   So, back to the broken DWD Unemployment Insurance division.   She reached out to the office of state Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield). She said staff there have been very helpful but can only do so much. She called Evers’ office. Someone there said he’d work on her problem and get back to her. More than a week later, nothing, Glupker said.   Desperation is setting in.   ‘Nothing left’  “Me, as an individual, I live by myself. I have no money coming in,” Glupker said. “I have depleted all of my savings account, all my 401(k). I have nothing left anymore.”  As she waits for DWD to figure out what it’s doing, the clock on Glupker’s mortgage reprieve is ticking. Her first-time-homebuyer loan allows her to forgo mortgage payments for up to six months. Come September, all those delayed monthly payments  — $6,000-worth — will come due, she said.   “How do I come up with that money?” she said.   Thankfully, the restaurant has reopened. But Milwaukee’s restrictive COVID-19 health order had only allowed 25 percent capacity. That means fewer employees are needed. The supper club owners have tried to provide workers with at least a couple of shifts each. It’s not much, but it’s something, Glupker said.   And the Milwaukee woman says she’s ready and willing to work. She even applied for a job at the Department of Workforce Development. With her background in insurance and human resources, Glupker said she knows DWD could desperately use the help.  “I’m a worker I’m a really really hard hard worker,” she said. “I would work if I could. I’m not trying to game the system.”   On vacation  Meanwhile, the big government incompetence at the agency is stunning.   Glupker said a friend dealing with the same unemployment struggles was told by a DWD agent that he would try to get her claims processed before he went on vacation. He wasn’t making any promises.

By March, when the coronavirus began accelerating through the United States, Shawn Hill-Watkins had been working as a cashier at a Food Lion supermarket in High Point, North Carolina, for seven months, taking three buses to work and back each day. She couldn’t afford the groceries she was ringing up for customers, but she had always been outgoing and knew how to keep the mood upbeat. Older regulars at the market sought out her line. They knew her by the colorful silk flowers she had sewn for herself, which she would wear behind her ear.

Hill-Watkins is 50, with six children and nine grandchildren. For years she’s lived around Virginia and in Philadelphia, making ends meet as a hairdresser, a seamstress and a house cleaner. Last June she came to North Carolina with her youngest son, Devan, after one of her daughters, who was in an abusive relationship, called her for help. Her daughter later left, but Hill-Watkins decided to remain. She had gotten the grocery job and eventually moved into a room with a kitchenette in an extended stay hotel just off Interstate 40 in Greensboro. Devan, who is 15, had made friends on a local football team. Hill-Watkins had been running around trying to help her children for two decades, she said, “and I felt like I couldn’t run with them anymore.”

Despite the rising risk of COVID-19, Hill-Watkins and her fellow cashiers were not wearing masks in early spring. It wasn’t long before she came down with something that seemed to be the virus. She was too sick to work — sleeping for hours and coughing up phlegm — but not sick enough to go to the hospital for testing. By the time she got back on her feet, a week and a half later, the store had reduced her hours to zero, where they’ve stayed ever since. (Food Lion said it doesn’t comment on “any specific associate matters” and that it “continues to follow guidance” from all health authorities.)

On April 20, Hill-Watkins filed for unemployment. For two months, she didn’t hear a word from the Division of Employment Security, or DES, the agency that operates North Carolina’s unemployment insurance system. By June 19, when her $1,261.60 monthly rent was due, she had $30 to her name. “There is a real possibility that we will be outside tomorrow,” Hill-Watkins told me a day before her rent deadline. “I wake up thinking about it. I go to sleep thinking about it.”

Hill-Watkins’ attempts to chase elusive benefits will sound familiar to the estimated 44 million Americans who have had to follow the absurdist script that often constitutes the application process: The obtuse online forms. The bewildering notifications and empty emails. The understaffed hotlines with half-day wait times. The fleeting transfers to a human operator, followed by a sudden disconnection.

Much of this bureaucratic ineptitude predates the pandemic. Nearly every unemployment system, run by each of the 50 states, has been plagued by outdated technology and administrative hurdles — and all have been overwhelmed by the sudden and historic spike in claims.

But as real as those problems are, they ignore a more fundamental issue: Some state unemployment systems have long been designed to exclude applicants. “People are frustrated and complaining everywhere. But there are degrees of how well states are handling this based on their approach to the program,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. “The states that are doing the worst at this have historically done a bad job of it.”

Among the worst, historically and at present, is North Carolina. At the end of 2019 — when the economy was humming and pandemics were the stuff of horror fiction — fewer than 1 in 10 jobless people in North Carolina received unemployment benefits. That’s the lowest rate in the country and well below the average of 26%.

The maximum number of weeks someone in the state can draw benefits is currently 12, compared with the national standard of 26 weeks. And those who receive benefits get less money than they used to: Between 2008 and 2019, the percentage of a worker’s wages replaced has fallen from 53% to 38%. North Carolina also ranks as the worst state for getting benefits to workers in a timely manner.

These outcomes are the result of a long campaign by North Carolina legislators to restrict and reduce benefits. In 2013, only a few years after the last economic cataclysm, the state’s Republicans made the deepest cuts to any unemployment insurance system in the country. “It’s fair to say that we don’t want people on unemployment in North Carolina and that we want them to have jobs,” state Rep. David Lewis, a Republican who helped draft the 2013 legislation, told ProPublica.

The overwhelming need for benefits today, and the delays that millions of Americans like Hill-Watkins have in getting them, has set off a national awakening about the sorry state of unemployment insurance systems. That reckoning is acute in North Carolina, where jobless people will be particularly vulnerable when the $600 weekly unemployment payments from the federal CARES Act expire at the end of July.

Before the pandemic, the state averaged 3,000 claims a week, according to the DES. In the first six weeks of the pandemic, its system was flooded with an average of 136,000 claims a week. “Despite those challenges, if there are no issues with a filed claim, a person usually receives their first payment within 14 days of filing,” said David Rhoades, spokesman for the DES. In the same statement, he also noted that “in the last five years, DES lost 20%, or $10 million, of its administrative funding.”

Hill-Watkins is certain that she would not have been as eager to remain in North Carolina had she known what was to come. If she’d been working in, say, Massachusetts when her hours were reduced to zero, she might have quickly received her benefits, which average $557 a week, for up to 30 weeks, the longest duration in the country. In Massachusetts, 66% of new applicants got their unemployment insurance payments in March, compared with 29% nationally and fewer than 10% in North Carolina, according to a Pew study. “I could have been anywhere else in the country,” Hill-Watkins said. “And here I am in the worst place to be.”

Among economists, it’s generally accepted that unemployment insurance is one of the most effective and cost-efficient policies to aid recovery. The premise is simple: Employers pay into the system in good times, which distributes benefits to employees laid off for economic reasons. The temporary cash payments only partially replace lost wages and are spent on basic necessities, providing a direct stimulus to local economies.

Economists may agree on this point, but politicians don’t. Democrats tend to highlight the positives: The benefits help families and promote consumer spending. Republicans typically point to the negatives: The tax is a burden on employers and a potential disincentive for employees to return to work. These divides have led to stark partisan and regional contrasts: Many Southern states have reduced benefits, while other parts of the country have maintained or even expanded their payments.

For decades, North Carolina’s program was in the middle of the pack. Then came the rise of the Tea Party and James Arthur Pope, a retail heir who’s been a major funder for the state’s libertarian movement. In 2010, Republicans took control of both houses in the legislature and in 2012, secured the governorship, putting the GOP in full command of the state for the first time since Reconstruction.

Among the first items on the new administration’s agenda was an overhaul of the state’s unemployment program. In less than two weeks, the GOP supermajority passed HB 4, a bill that made the deepest cut to any state’s unemployment compensation in American history. “In terms of governing, this was the Republicans’ coming out party,” said Mac McCorkle, a former Democratic political consultant who now teaches at Duke University.

The bill slashed the duration of benefits and lowered maximum weekly payment amount from $535 to $350. It also changed how benefits were calculated — from the highest quarter of a claimant’s earnings in the last year to an average of the most recent two quarters. Since many workers have their hours and pay reduced in the quarter prior to layoffs, this resulted in smaller payouts. At the end of 2019, the national average for weekly payments was $378; in North Carolina, it was $277.

The key impetus for these cuts, according to Lewis and two other Republican legislators who supported HB 4, was to pay back the debt — some $2.5 billion — that the state owed the federal government. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, 35 states, including North Carolina, had to borrow from the federal government to sustain their unemployment payments. Those loans came with interest and in 2012, the federal government triggered an increase in the amount that each state’s employers had to pay into the state’s unemployment trust fund. These higher taxes, Lewis said, “made North Carolina less attractive to a potential employer because you didn’t have to only factor in business expenses, but you also had to factor in your percentage of repaying this debt.” The goal, he said, was to create “a business climate that is good for business and employees.”

In truth, unemployment insurance taxes in North Carolina were already low. The year before HB 4 was passed, The Tax Foundation, a policy think tank, ranked the state as having the seventh most favorable unemployment tax for employers. (It scored less favorably in other categories.)

Not all states that owed money to the federal government took the same path as North Carolina. Some, like Rhode Island, temporarily raised the amount of taxes employers paid into the system. Others slowly paid off the debt without making changes, added programs that expanded eligibility or supported short-term compensation for reduced hours (known as work sharing). “We were fully aware that there might have to be some cuts to pay back the debt,” said Bill Rowe, the deputy director of the North Carolina Justice Center, a progressive policy organization. “But we were shocked about how severe and permanent they were. Anything that had previously benefited workers was taken out of our law.”

HB 4 also limited “attached claims,” a feature that had previously streamlined the application process by allowing employers to file in bulk for an entire group of workers who have been laid off. And the bill disqualified people who had lost a job for “good-cause” reasons, such as family caregiving or to follow a spouse who has to relocate for work, from collecting unemployment. “You couldn’t just say my husband has been transferred,” said state Rep. Julia Howard, a Republican who was one of the bill’s primary sponsors. “We made it reasonable, so it was not just a gimme.”

When the law went into effect on July 1, 2013, the effect on people collecting benefits was immediate and made national headlines. Before HB 4, residents had received extended benefits through the federal government’s 2009 stimulus package. But this federal aid, which lasted through 2013, required that states maintain their benefits structure. By rushing to implement their changes, rather than waiting until the end of the year, North Carolina’s Republicans forfeited their constituents’ eligibility for this program, stripping an estimated 170,000 people of benefits. It was the only legislature to do so.

That decision was “deeply unpopular” in the state, according to The American Conservative, in a 2013 article titled “How Raleigh’s Republicans Forgot the Working Class.” That analysis noted that North Carolinians were collecting extended unemployment not because it was comfortable but because “there are simply no jobs to be found.” At the time, the state had the fifth highest unemployment rate in the nation.

The cuts to the state’s unemployment program were part of a broader makeover by free-market ideologues, according to Gene Nichol, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. “Between 2013 and 2017, there was a real shift in the theory of the role of government, some might generously call it,” he said, noting the general assembly’s elimination of the state’s earned income tax credit, an anti-poverty program popular with conservatives, and its decision not to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. “I call it waging a war on poor people.”

Still, a central goal for the law was achieved: North Carolina was able to pay off its debt to the federal government by 2015 — four to five years earlier than it otherwise would have and even more quickly than those who had crafted the bill had anticipated.

At that point, Democrats hoped the assembly would restore benefits to their previous levels, according to three state Democrats. Instead, the Republican majority cut deeper. It pared taxes on employers and added provisions to further restrict eligibility by requiring claimants to contact five potential employers each week.

North Carolina was not the only state to slash benefits. The “realignment,” as Howard, the Republican state representative, put it, was adopted by other states in the region. “We have had numerous other states call us and ask us if we would send them a one-sheeter on what we did and how we did it.”

Between 2011 and 2015, eight other states, mostly in the south, reduced how long people can collect benefits. These cuts can have a disproportionate impact on Black workers, who average 25.9 weeks of unemployment, compared with the average white worker who remains unemployed for 19 weeks, according to the National Employment Law Project.

It’s a “troubling trend,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University and former chief economist for the Labor Department. There is a real risk, he said, that employees may find unemployment to be too comfortable and that employers might flee to states with lower taxes. But “so many states now go way too far in the direction of not wanting to upset the employer community,” he said. “And the states that let the pendulum swing so far are doing permanent damage to workers and households.”

Hill-Watkins has never been the type of person who is easily discouraged by bureaucracy and paperwork. She used to volunteer with a tenants union and is meticulous with records. She sent the DES every piece of information it requested. Every week she uploaded her schedule, listing zero hours. She called the hotline, messaged the chatline. “No one wants this for me more than I do,” she said.

In May, Hill-Watkins said, she waited for hours on hold to talk to someone at the DES, with 189 people ahead of her. When it was her turn, she was told there was nothing anyone there could do for her over the phone: The agency already had the materials to process Hill-Watkins’ claim, it said. She just needed to wait for someone to do so. “I know there’s a lot of people going through the same situation I’m going through,” Hill-Watkins said. “But it’s ridiculous that the wait time is 14 days to six weeks. And that’s just to know whether you are even eligible.”

When asked about the delays that Hill-Watkins faced, Rhoades, the DES spokesman, said the agency does not comment on individual cases. Generally, he said that the agency was prioritizing claims that were filed earliest, having adjudicated 96% of claims filed since mid-Mid March and delivered 82.8% of its first payments within the 14-day standard. The massive influx in the volume of claims, short staffing levels, and new procedures introduced by the CARES Act have slowed down the timeliness of some payments, he said.

Hill-Watkins had never filed for unemployment before. “I worked,” she told me in early June. “No matter what it is, I work.” She was holding the phone with one hand and cooking dinner for her son — some chicken, onions and bell pepper she’d picked up from the food bank — with the other. “I raised six children on my own.” Before working at the supermarket, she had earned a living as an independent contractor by tapping into a network of longtime clients, references and friends. She knew who needed a babysitter, who wanted a dress made or who was due to get braids done. If there weren’t a virus to worry about, she knew she would have been able to make do on her own after her hours were cut. The problem was that “there’s no social distancing in any of those jobs,” and with high blood pressure, she couldn’t take the risk.

Since losing work, every day had become a blur of emails sent, numbers dialed, calls unanswered. She shared her resume with employers on Indeed. She scoured the lists of food banks, local charities and low-income housing opportunities. She wrote to social service agencies and social workers, to legislators and churches. The subject line read: “Scared single mother.”

Few people responded and when they did, there always seemed to be a catch. Like the homeless agency that told her she didn’t qualify for a shelter because she was already living in a hotel. Or the fact that the most promising lead she found for remote work — providing customer service from home — required her to get her own landline. To get a landline, she needed an apartment, but without a job, she couldn’t fill out an apartment application.

These dead ends left her at the mercy of the state. “I never wanted to be sitting and waiting for somebody to justify giving me money to survive,” she said. “I would rather be out there scraping and scratching and hustling than waiting for someone to validate my life with their little change.”

One of the few consolations for Hill-Watkins was that she wasn’t alone. Several other workers — and even state legislators trying to file on behalf of their constituents — described the same difficulties she had with the program’s application process. For instance, if applicants make a single mistake, it’s not possible to go back into the form to change it. Instead, they have to call a hotline, with a wait time that often ranges between two and seven hours. And when someone from the hotline says they are transferring the call, more often than not the applicant will get disconnected. The DES confirmed that, in order to prevent fraud, it limits the changes claimants can make to their application.

A contractor working with the DES call center, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed that these frustrations are in fact standard features of the system. “If the whole queue is full, then the line gets dropped,” she said, and applicants “have no choice but to call back and go through this process over and over again.”

The unemployment system, she said, is just as opaque and chaotic for those working inside it as it is for those on the outside. Call center employees do not have the authority to adjudicate claims in North Carolina, the contractor said; they are merely a conduit through which residents can vent their frustration. Some of the people she speaks with have lost their houses and jobs and want to scream about it. Others just want to sit on the phone with her and cry. “I’m the only voice they can talk to,” she said. All she can do is listen and tell them to keep waiting. (The DES responded, “We are training call center representatives to build their skill sets so they can assist as many people as possible. However, more complex issues may need to be handled by the more experienced staff.”)

These headaches are not surprising to experts like Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project. The coronavirus may have been unexpected, Evermore said, but the collapse of unemployment systems in many states was not. Evermore published a prescient report in early March, warning that the depth of North Carolina’s cuts to its unemployment benefits and staffing had left the state unprepared for the next recession. “These systems that were undermined for the past decade are very hard to turn around,” she said, comparing the process to steering a barge.

Such an attempt to reverse course is precisely what’s happening in North Carolina right now. Since March, Roy Cooper, the state’s Democratic governor, has signed several executive orders to temporarily remove some of the obstacles from the application process. The orders waive the requirement that applicants search for work; eliminate the one-week waiting period between filing for unemployment and receiving benefits; and allow employers to file claims for entire groups of workers who have been laid off. (The DES, according to Rhoades, its spokesman, has also acted to “improve its processes, technology and staffing levels to respond to the surge in claims,” including by adding an online chat feature and increasing staff from 500 employees to 2,600.) The orders show, Evermore said, that “when the government decides to clear away the roadblocks to paying benefits, it can.”

Still, none of those changes are permanent; they expire when the governor rescinds his declaration of the state of emergency. North Carolina Democrats hope the crisis will create an opportunity to make permanent changes, just as the 2008 recession did for their Republican counterparts.

So far the signs have not been promising. In May the Republican-controlled state assembly rejected a Democratic measure, previously passed in the senate, to temporarily increase the maximum benefit amount from $350 to $400. (The extra costs would have been fully covered by the federal government as part of its extension of state benefits.) “I’ve pushed back pretty hard about making changes during this time frame,” Howard said. “I do not think that now is the time — when the ship is on fire — that we need to be trying to change things.”

On June 17, nearly two months after she had applied, Hill-Watkins received an update on her unemployment application. The notice, which she accessed through the state’s online portal, was the sort of oddity that is common in the unemployment process. It laid out the amount she would receive — $150 per week for up to 12 weeks — if she were deemed eligible for state benefits. The notice was silent as to whether she would be found eligible and made no mention of when that decision might come. Whether due to a glitch in the system or an overzealous administrator, she was sent this same correspondence three more times: once at 1:30 a.m. and twice at 5 a.m.

To Hill-Watkins, the agency’s timing was curious. The day before, ProPublica had asked the DES about Hill-Watkins’ application. “Am I not worthy of this unless someone else speaks up for me?” she wondered, “I did the work. And I’m the one sitting here without the money.” (The DES did not respond directly when asked whether ProPublica’s questions influenced the agency’s timing or decision; its spokesperson said that Hill-Watkins’ claim was referred to a team “dedicated to resolving the oldest and most complicated claims.”)

Hill-Watkins tried calling the DES to find out more. She wanted to know when she might obtain or qualify for these payments and whether she would also receive the additional $600 per week from the CARES Act. As usual, she couldn’t get anyone on the phone. Each of the four times she called, the automated message politely suggested she call back another time.

“I don’t have any more time, though, is the thing,” she told me on June 19, the day her rent was due. She wondered if she would have to wait another eight weeks for the unemployment office to find her eligible. Or to pay her. “It’s unbelievable they can keep you waiting for this long,” she said, “and expect you to survive.”

By this point, she had missed her rent payment. Managers at the hotel had come by and asked her to leave the room. She told them that, because she had stayed in the hotel for more than 30 days and it was her primary residence, she believed she qualified as a tenant and was entitled to the same protections against evictions.

That argument did not appear to sway the manager. Hill-Watkins’ keycard for the room was deactivated. Unsure if she and Devan would be able to get back in if they left for even five minutes, they stayed in the room the entire weekend. (The hotel manager did not respond to a request for comment.)

On Monday, June 22, came the news Hill-Watkins had been waiting two months to hear: She was eligible for unemployment benefits. At 12:21 that afternoon, $750 was directly deposited into her bank account. Hill-Watkins compared the feeling to the moving of a great mountain.

She allowed herself a moment of optimism. She has long dreamed of saving up enough money to buy an RV. If she had it her way, she would camp forever. With the car, she and Devan could shelter in place in any state. She wouldn’t have to worry about a checkout date or the hazards of social distancing. The next time one of her children called her for help, she could ride to them and then ride away. They would never have to worry about being homeless again.

Editor’s note:

As this story was about to be published, ProPublica learned that the freelance photographer ProPublica hired to take photographs of Shawn Hill-Watkins for this article was so moved by Hill-Watkins’ plight that she sold some of her work to benefit Hill-Watkins and sent her $2,000. The funds arrived later on June 22, after Hill-Watkins received her unemployment benefits. In addition, the photographer promoted a GoFundMe page for Hill-Watkins, which prompted $9,740 in contributions from other people as of June 29. The photographer did not inform ProPublica that she was helping to raise funds for Hill-Watkins.

As laudable as the photographer’s intentions were, paying sources violates ProPublica’s editorial guidelines. For that reason, we decided not to publish the original photographs taken for this story. (We did pay her for her work.)

Ultimately, we concluded that because the photographer’s fundraising occurred after the reporting and writing for this article was completed (only fact-checking and editing remained at that point), this couldn’t be construed as paying Hill-Watkins for access.

As record numbers of Americans started losing their jobs in early April, it served 123,000 people — its highest number of clients ever in a single month.

Lines began to calm down a bit in mid-April as Americans started receiving their stimulus checks, as well as an additional $600 in weekly unemployment benefits, thanks to the $2.2 trillion stimulus package known as the CARES Act, Jocelyn Lantrip, communications and marketing director for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, said.

Lantrip thinks the worst may be yet to come. More than 25% of Nevada’s labor force is unemployed, the highest unemployment rate of any state, and Lantrip said she’s “anticipating even higher need for food assistance in August” than at the onset of the pandemic.

By now the majority of Americans, particularly from lower-income brackets, have already spent their stimulus checks. If lawmakers don’t act before the July 31 deadline, more than 20 million Americans will stop receiving the supplemental $600 a week in unemployment benefits.

In total, that would mean that Americans would have $842 billion less to spend to pay for their own food and living expenses, according to Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.

But just how many people are going to show up to the food bank come August 1 is nearly impossible to predict “because we have never seen anything like this before,” Lantrip said.

For instance, the food bank’s Mobile Harvest program — which distributes perishable foods and produce — served about 8,900 people per month in the eight months prior to coronavirus. In April, that number rose to 28,272 people served in one month.

Additionally, the food bank’s program for children who aren’t in school has also been in high demand. Since schools closed because of the pandemic, the food bank distributed more than 314,000 meals, which is more than it distributed during its entire previous fiscal year, Lantrip told MarketWatch.

Not only have food bank officials had to purchase more food than ever before, they’ve also had to reconstruct their entire business model, switching it to a drive-thru operation to accommodate social distancing. They’ve also had to move their drive-thru location several times as businesses reopened and parking lots that had been empty went back into use, Lantrip said.

“ The food bank’s Mobile Harvest program — which distributes perishable foods and produce — served about 8,900 people per month in the eight months prior to coronavirus. In April, that number rose to 28,272 people served in one month. ”

“It has also been difficult to keep volunteers at a safe social distance while still having enough people to help,” she added.

‘Heartbreaking demand’ at a Hawaii food pantry

Figuring out how to operate a socially distanced food bank wasn’t an issue for The Pantry, a food bank based in Honolulu, Hawaii which provides food to any resident in need on the O’ahu Island, where it is located.

Before the pandemic, The Pantry was already serving clients through a contactless e-commerce platform that let families select the items they needed based on the size of their household and then pick the food up at the site. What was an issue, though, was figuring out how to handle the “heartbreaking demand” for food assistance, said Jennine Sullivan, executive director of The Pantry.

“ Over the course of the month, The Pantry distributed 15,000 pounds of food. In May it distributed 100,000 pounds of food and in the third week of June, it handed out an amount equivalent to April and May combined in just one week. ”

In April demand at The Pantry began skyrocketing at unprecedented rates.

Over the course of the month, it distributed 15,000 pounds of food. In May it distributed 100,000 pounds of food and by the third week of June, it handed out an amount that was equivalent to April and May combined in just one week. One family of five who Sullivan helped serve saw their entire household income “drop to zero” over the course of those few months, she said.

The exponential growth in demand doesn’t appear to be slowing any time soon and is likely to climb even higher when Americans stop receiving the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits, given that Hawaii has the second-highest rate of unemployment, Sullivan told MarketWatch.

“It’s a struggle every day,” Sullivan said, particularly because “we live on an island and food supply is so limited so we have to be creative about how we get our food.”

Everyone on the island, including grocery stores and other food pantries, are competing for the limited supply of food, and the situation has been exacerbated by the fact that so many shipments of food into the island have been delayed by weeks and sometimes months.

Normally grocery stores would donate unsold foods, but because more Hawaiians have been shopping at those stores and buying in bulk, they have little to spare, and The Pantry can’t afford to buy from those stories, Sullivan told MarketWatch. Partnerships with restaurants like 53 by the Sea, an upscale fish restaurant in Honolulu, have been particularly useful.

“ ‘It’s a struggle every day,’ particularly because ‘we live on an island and food supply is so limited so we have to be creative about how we get our food.’ ” — Jennine Sullivan, executive director of The Pantry based in Honolulu, Hawaii

Earlier in the pandemic when 53 by the Sea wasn’t open, it donated 300,000 pounds of steak and 45 pounds of yogurt, which Sullivan said The Pantry used to make yogurt parfaits.

Sullivan said she is constantly looking to form more public-private partnerships, especially as August approaches.

A Nebraska food bank says ‘we need to brace ourselves’

Even in Nebraska, where there is the lowest rate of unemployment in the U.S., Scott Young, executive director of the Food Bank of Lincoln, which serves 16 counties in southeast Nebraska, said demand has been unprecedented.

“Immediately when the pandemic started, we saw an increase in food insecurity,” he said. In early April, his team helped load a truck with enough food to feed 175 people, but 300 ended up showing up.

Thankfully, colleagues at the scene recognized the problem early on, so they rationed out the food so everyone in line could get some, Young said. “We try to never say to anyone ‘There’s no food left.’ I don’t think we’ve ever gotten to the end of the line and said ‘There’s no food for you.’”

But similar to what Lantrip saw in Nevada, “there was flattening after mid-April,” he said. Since then demand for food assistance has been highly unpredictable, Young told MarketWatch. Until recently, the National Guard helped distribute food, “which made all the difference in the world,” Young said, “now we’re back to rounding up volunteers.”

That hasn’t been an easy task given that its usual team of volunteers is predominantly over the age of 65, and the food bank hasn’t allowed them to volunteer since the pandemic hit because they are more vulnerable to coronavirus.

“ ‘I don’t think we’ve ever gotten to the end of the line and said ‘There’s no food for you.’’ ” — Scott Young, executive director at the Food Bank of Lincoln

Looking ahead into August, Young said he had no idea what to expect. But he knows that “we need to brace ourselves.”

“There’s a lot of missing facts,” like whether schools will remain closed in the fall or whether there will be another meat shortage, Young said. “Our priorities remain the same but we will need more donations to continue our operations.”

Food pantries are also getting extra help under the CARES Act

All three pantries MarketWatch spoke to have received food from the U.S. Department of Agriculture through The Emergency Food Assistance Program. Under that program, the USDA purchases foods on behalf of the states and distributes it based on state unemployment levels and the number of people with incomes below the poverty level.

Over the course of the pandemic, the department has purchased more than $850 million worth of food, which has been possible because of the CARES Act.

“This is a challenging time for many Americans,” Brandon Lipps, USDA Deputy Under Secretary, said. “USDA is addressing the unprecedented demand from all angles to equip our state and local partners across the country with food and resources to serve those in need.”

The USDA declined to share any specific measures it is taking to prepare for a potential second wave of demand for food assistance in August if unemployed Americans stop receiving the extra $600 a week.","                       A link that brings you back to the homepage.

http://longisland.news12.com/story/42305298/some-restaurant-owners-struggling-to-get-employees-on-unemployment-to-return,"Some Long Island restaurants are struggling to get employees back to work, and they feel it's because of unemployment pay.

The issue revolves around the $600 bonus the federal government is including in the unemployment checks to people who lost their jobs. New York's unemployment is considered generous compared to many other states, and people on unemployment are earning more than $1,000 a week.

Because of that aid, restaurant owners say many of their servers and cooks are not coming back. At one Mattituck restaurant, they're down about a half-dozen workers.

""No one's come right out and saying they're going to stay at home and not work because they're lazy. What they're saying is they're afraid of COVID. Meanwhile they're still going to the supermarket and they're hanging out at the beach,"" says Chris Richards, of CJ's American Grill.

With the all-important Fourth of July weekend coming up, owners are hoping for big weekends, and more employees to support that.

But at Port Waterfront Bar and Grill, they've had to shorten their hours.

""So instead of opening at 11, we open at noon. Instead of closing at 11, we close at 9 and then we close one day a week so everybody can have a day off,"" says Keith Bavaro.

Rep. Pete King says he's heard plenty of examples of people's former workplace not paying enough to come back to work, whether it be in restaurants, landscaping or other businesses.

""This is just an unintended consequence of trying to do the right thing,"" says King.

The bonus expires at the end of July, and Congress could extend it. King says both parties are trying to figure out a way to address the issue of some finding it more valuable to stay out of work.","           Home Create Account Log In Go Home News COVID-19 Unrest in America Road Trip: Close to Home Business Cheddar Business Education Entertainment Features News 12 Varsity Numbers & Links Power & Politics Sports Transportation Sports Scores Traffic U.S. & World News Your Photos - Send Us!

https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/07/10/poor-childless-adults-left-out-of-the-social-safety-net,"Poor working-age adults with no kids at home are out of luck when it comes to public assistance. They get virtually no federal assistance, and, as this new Center on Budget and Policy Priorities study shows, their last public resort, state general assistance – which was never much to begin with – has eroded severely over the last 25 years.

I recently discussed how welfare reform in 1996 weakened the federal cash safety net, but poor childless adults aren't even eligible for the main federal cash benefit program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. They're also limited to only three months of SNAP (food stamp) benefits out of every three years unless they're working at least half time. States were allowed to suspend that limitation while the economy was weak but, as the economic recovery continues, fewer and fewer states will have the authority to do so. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that at least 1 million childless adults will lose their benefits between now and the end of 2016.



Many very poor childless adults have disabilities that make working hard or impossible, but they don't meet the severe disability standard for receiving Supplemental Security Income – the federal program for people who are disabled, poor or elderly and have very low incomes and few assets. Those without disabilities often struggle to find work in the best of times and don't get paid much when they do work. Any unemployment insurance benefits they receive will likely be small and, when they're gone, there's no cash or food assistance to replace them. These individuals may not qualify for unemployment insurance at all if they lose a job they've only held for a little while, even if they lose it through no fault of their own.

That leaves state general assistance as the only cash program for poor childless adults. Benefits are small, however, and a diminishing number of states offer any benefits at all.

As CBPP reports, the number of states with general assistance has fallen from 38 to 26 since 1989, and benefits have shrunk in inflation-adjusted terms in nearly every state since 1998. In nearly all the states still offering general assistance, the maximum benefit is below half of the poverty line for an individual; in half of those states, it's below one-quarter of the poverty line. Many states have not changed their benefit levels in decades; some have raised benefit levels, but not by enough to keep up with inflation, and some states have even cut nominal benefit levels.



The map below shows the 26 states with a general assistance program that either operated statewide or was mandated and governed by statewide guidelines as of April 2015. More than half of them only serve individuals who are disabled or otherwise considered unemployable. The rest also serve individuals who are employable but ineligible for other public assistance. Many states have tightened eligibility or imposed time limits for receiving general assistance, even for people with longer-term disabilities.

The agency, already embroiled in sorting out fraudulent claims and delayed payments, now projects it will soon run short of funds. (Ted S. Warren / Associated Press)             By   Paul Roberts    Seattle Times business reporter     Washington state may need to borrow federal funds to cover claims for jobless benefits after a new forecast shows a likely shortfall in the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund. The shortfall, announced Monday by the state Employment Security Department (ESD), reflects the unprecedented number of layoffs during the pandemic coupled with a new forecast for a slower economic recovery and lingering unemployment in Washington state. The ESD, which has often struggled to process claims for benefits, was also hit by widespread fraud that siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars in both state and federal unemployment benefits. The state’s unemployment trust fund, which stood at $4.7 billion on March 1, is now at $2.8 billion and is expected to be depleted by late 2020 or early 2021, ESD officials said. The agency was quick to emphasize that the availability of no- and low-interest federal loans, which 12 states or territories have already sought, ensures that benefits won’t run out. “We wanted to be clear with folks that benefits never run out,”
said ESD spokesperson Nick Demerice, adding that Washington will begin applying
for its own federal loan in August or September.  Advertising      Since the first big pandemic-related layoffs in early March, Washington has paid out more than $6.5 billion in benefits, though roughly two-thirds of that has been in emergency federal funds, including a $600 weekly payment. Monday’s announcement is the first public indication from the agency that the state trust fund, which is funded through taxes on employers, might not remain solvent without additional money. Since the start of the pandemic, ESD officials have often described the trust fund as healthy and have noted that Washington’s unemployment insurance finances are in better shape than in many other states. “We have drawn it down, but it’s still quite strong,” said ESD Commissioner Suzi LeVine at a news conference Thursday. “And when you look across the United States, knowing that nine states have already applied for federal loans, we’re in a pretty good spot.” Demerice said Monday’s less rosy outlook for the trust fund reflects a new economic forecast by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC). That forecast, issued June 17, shows a much higher unemployment rate than had been previously expected, thanks to the pandemic-fueled recession. For the fourth quarter of 2020, the ERFC now predicts a statewide unemployment rate of 9.3%, or more than twice the rate forecasted in February. That more-dire outlook led the ESD to downgrade its own forecast for the trust fund: the agency in November expected to have around $5 billion in the trust fund by the end of 2020, but it now expects to run out by as early as December without a federal loan, Demerice said. He added that the new outlook was shared with LeVine after the Thursday press conference. Although federal loans ensure that the ESD will be able to cover all claims for jobless benefits, repaying those loans could lead to some increases in employer taxes, though how much is not yet clear, Demerice said.

https://www.wpr.org/lives-hold-pandemic-exposes-failures-wisconsin-unemployment-insurance-system,"When Fall River-based Robbins Manufacturing laid off David Ficke on March 29, the welder followed in the footsteps of hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites during the coronavirus pandemic. He filed an initial unemployment claim, hoping it would help him survive a shutdown of much of the state’s economy.

But when an early morning call to the state’s unemployment helpline placed him in a queue of 400 to 500 people, Ficke knew he would wait a long time for aid as Wisconsin’s first come, first served system drowned in a flood of claims.

Unable to pay rent at his apartment in Beaver Dam, he moved into the ""Hotel Chrysler"" — his 2006 Town and Country Touring Edition minivan. Ficke drove west to a rest stop outside of Albert Lea, Minnesota. He wanted to be near his 3-year-old daughter who was living with his ex-wife and her family.

The family soon discovered Ficke was living in his van and insisted that he stay with them. That is how he ended up living with his ex-wife, her parents and her new boyfriend.

""It is what it is,"" Ficke, 42, said in a video interview over Facebook Messenger. Ficke could not speak over his cell phone; he lost service for lack of payment during his nearly three-month wait for jobless benefits. But he’s trying to stay positive.

""We’re all here for our little baby,"" he said of his daughter.

Half A Million Claims Pending

The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) has paid about 2.5 million of more than 3.4 million weekly unemployment claims it received between March 15 and June 20. The agency has denied 409,000 claims and has yet to process 509,000 others, the latter of which represents about 151,000 people.

The agency added hundreds of new and reassigned workers during the pandemic to staff phone lines and process and adjudicate backlogged claims. DWD Secretary Caleb Frostman said in a June 17 interview that his agency was ""very, very close"" to resolving outstanding claims from March, the earliest days of the pandemic, and the agency is prioritizing adjudicated claims in the order they were received.

Frostman blames the slow pace on a chronically underfunded and outdated computer system and initial short staffing that left his agency ill-equipped to handle the rapid onslaught of claims. Republican lawmakers accuse Frostman and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for lacking urgency — waiting too long to expand call center hours and shift employees to address the biggest problems.

Not up for debate: that Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance system has failed to deliver for thousands of residents at a time when they most need it, leaving many to miss bill payments, rack up new credit card debt, lean on food pantries and face eviction — even homelessness.

The state’s tangled unemployment safety net has failed in a variety of ways to catch its residents, interviews with 16 laid-off workers show. Their stories highlight the difficulties of navigating the state’s unemployment system under any circumstances — let alone during a global pandemic.

Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance woes are part of a national trend, according to experts and media reports.

Pennsylvania as of mid-June still had yet to process 15 percent of claims filed in March. In Florida, which has received 2.3 million ""unique"" jobless applications, one applicant needing to provide information reported calling an assistance line as many as 400 times without getting through. Unemployment insurance applicants in Kentucky have waited outside of state offices for hours to resolve claims issues in person. Washington state called in the National Guard to address its claims backlog. The interim director of Nevada’s unemployment insurance system resigned from her post after the governor reported ""threats to her personal safety"" from frustrated claimants.

The pandemic struck after a years-long push in Wisconsin and other states to make accessing jobless benefits harder.

Just 32 percent of unemployed Wisconsin workers accessed benefits in 2016, down from 50 percent in 2007, according to a 2017 study by the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit that supports protections for low-wage workers and the unemployed. Nationally, the rate of covered unemployed workers fell from 36 percent to 27 percent over the same period.

""Systems have been over-calibrated to prevent overpayments at the expense of paying appropriate benefits. States have programmed their computer systems to pause applications at every decision point, which can generate multiple eligibility determinations and denials,"" Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst with the unemployment law group, testified this month to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.

""As we have seen, that is going to slow down benefits getting to the public when there is a crisis,"" Evermore said.

'Not Sure' Leads To Long Wait

Ficke’s wait for help concerns how he lost a previous welding job at Karavan Trailers in Fox Lake in 2018. Wisconsin requires unemployment insurance applicants to have worked within the past 18 months and earned enough wages. Applicants must detail that job history.

Ficke is not sure whether Karavan fired or laid him off, but his exit came as the company cut more than 50 employees at once, he recalled. The exit was not traumatic when it happened, since Ficke had already started working part time at Robbins with prospects to add more hours.

Asked on his unemployment insurance application to explain why he left Karavan, Ficke checked a box signaling he was unsure. That sent his application into an abyss of claims needing adjudication — and it required reaching an elusive DWD staffer over the phone.

""I understand waiting four or five weeks. I get it, I do,"" Ficke said. ""But when you’re out eight, nine,10, 11 weeks, you have to be able to do something for the people.""

He added: ""We need to hold people accountable.""

Problems not new

Ficke is among many who complain of getting kicked off overwhelmed DWD phone lines while trying to resolve claims issues. The pandemic made the problem more visible, but the issue is not new.

A 2014 state audit found that DWD call centers automatically blocked 80 percent of calls during times of high volume.

""It can be challenging for DWD to handle significant, temporary increases in calls during certain times of the year. If the steps that DWD has planned are insufficient and large numbers of calls are blocked in the coming months, DWD may need to take additional action,"" the audit said.

The audit came as Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Legislature largely focused on limiting access to unemployment insurance and reducing perceived fraud.

Beginning in 2011, the Legislature under then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, enacted a series of laws that: created a one-week waiting period for benefits (temporarily waived during the pandemic), increased work search requirements for recipients, disqualified people on federal disability from accessing unemployment compensation and increased criminal penalties for making false statements or representations on applications.

Additionally, Walker signed a lame-duck law just before Evers took office that restricts the governor’s ability to waive certain requirements for state-federal benefits programs including unemployment insurance. And Wisconsin’s $370 a week maximum benefit is among the most miserly in the United States, ranking 40th among the states and the District of Columbia. (Through the $2 trillion CARES Act stimulus, the federal government is adding $600 to each check through July 31.)

Unemployment applicants as of June 23 spent an average of 19 days waiting for their claims to be paid, according to DWD. But people in Ficke’s shoes are waiting much longer as the agency investigates and adjudicates issues its system flags as problematic.

In May the agency announced it had contracted the firm Nelnet to provide at least 200 people to process and adjudicate claims. The agency later said Nelnet would ramp up to 300 such workers by the end of June. DWD contracted two additional vendors to add hundreds of new staff to overwhelmed phone lines. The agency received 439,000-plus unemployment insurance calls the week of June 20 alone.

All told, Frostman said the agency will be adding about 1,300 new staffers to handle the surge of claims and calls, up from 504 total unemployment insurance staff in March. But 20,000-plus people continue to file initial claims every week, only adding to the adjudication line. Many laid off workers can’t afford to wait any longer for help.

That includes Chenon Times-Rainwater, a 41-year-old life coach and small business owner in West Bend. She waited more than two months for her claim. It was resolved June 26, but she said the agency did not calculate her benefits correctly. Times-Rainwater made the difficult decision during the pandemic to place her 16-year-old daughter with special needs in a group home when her family could no longer pay for caregivers to come to their house.

""We can’t afford to pay her staff without income.""

Times-Rainwater helps organize Wisconsin Unemployment Support Group, a Facebook gathering to trade tips and moral support for folks battling DWD bureaucracy. The group has swelled to about 4,000 members during the pandemic. In her leadership role, Times-Rainwater said she has helped relocate 14 families that have lost their homes after losing jobs and lacking state aid.

Her group wants Evers to fire Frostman and Mark Reihl, DWD’s unemployment insurance administrator.

""The incompetence and unwillingness to coordinate with other states, seek appropriate guidance, acknowledge defeat, and accept any responsibility for the ultimate failure of the DWD’s response the Covid Relief efforts are astounding,"" the group said in a press release Thursday

""Sixteen weeks people have gone without income,"" Times-Rainwater said in an interview, ""and nobody cares.""

Wisconsin Slow To Distribute Federal Aid

Wisconsin is also distributing unemployment benefits under a separate federal program: Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Congress created the program for people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic but ""would not qualify for regular unemployment compensation.""

Congress channeled PUA funds through state unemployment insurance agencies, and Wisconsin has struggled to allocate the money to folks who need it. That includes Adriana Patino, 44, of Marshall in Dane County.

The single mother, who asked to be identified by her maiden name, earns a living transcribing and captioning off-line videos such as university lectures and work training — work that began drying up in April.



After nearly two months of waiting, Adriana Patino finally received unemployment aid in late June, but only after tragedy struck. While waiting for her claim to be reviewed, Patino learned that her eldest daughter died in Texas, and she had no money to travel to the memorial service. Courtesy of Adriana Patino

PUA was designed specifically to reach people like her; as an independent contractor, she does not qualify for traditional unemployment aid. But Patino said DWD took two months to even allow her to apply for PUA, leaving her without income and falling behind on rent and car payments. DWD eventually expedited the denial — but only after tragedy struck.

Patino previously worked for a company called CRV Holdings. She left on good terms last year to pivot to freelancing — giving her more time to care for her 5-year-old daughter. DWD doesn’t allow people to apply for PUA until the agency denies them regular benefits.

Patino’s case is not complicated in that regard; leaving a job voluntarily, even on good terms, is enough to prompt a Wisconsin claim denial. But she waited two months for DWD to deny her regular claim.

While still waiting for a denial, Patino learned that her eldest daughter died in Texas, and she had no money to travel to the memorial service, which has since been delayed to avoid spreading COVID-19. The same day she heard the terrible news, Evers’ office replied to one of her earlier emails seeking help. Patino sent a fiery follow up.

""I ripped into them,"" she said. ""Life is unpredictable, but to assume everyone can wait (for unemployment benefits) is a guarantee that a small percentage of those folks will be affected tremendously.""

An adjudicator called the next day with news: DWD had finally denied the regular claim. That sent Patino into a new queue of people waiting on the agency to process their PUA claims.

""What’s scary is that some of the PUA questions leave room for the adjudicator to make an assessment that could go another way if it were someone else. Mine were both very kind, but when they use terms like 'fair enough' — and your livelihood is hanging in the balance — it is unnerving,"" Patino said.

Money finally showed up in Patino’s bank account on June 22.

""It’s just a testament to how slow the process still is, even when they do try to expedite a request from the governor’s office because of circumstances like mine,"" Patino said.

Wisconsin accepted more than 75,000 PUA claims through June 20. Congress created PUA in late March, and the U.S. Department of Labor issued administration guidance to states on April 5. But Wisconsin did not begin accepting claims until April 21, and DWD took another month to issue determinations and payments.

Frostman, the workforce secretary, said his agency needed time to interpret federal guidance for the new program. By April 27, for example, state agencies nationwide asked enough questions to prompt the labor department to update its guidance. Another obstacle Frostman cited: DWD’s 1970s-era technology, a vulnerability that lawmakers and regulators have understood for decades but never bothered to fix.

DWD planned a major overhaul of its computer system more than a decade ago, but Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration pulled the plug in 2007 as the project — contracted to two outside companies — fell behind schedule and looked poised to exceed its $24 million budget.

The agency’s IT system requires sequential testing and programming, Frostman said, meaning new benefits programs must be added to the system one at a time. That meant DWD could not program PUA rules until it finished handling other changes required by Congress and the Wisconsin Legislature. Those include the federal government’s temporary $600 weekly increase in benefits and the state’s waiver of a one-week waiting period for benefits.

The agency began accepting applications on June 24 for benefits under another federal program: Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which adds 13 weeks of aid for people who have exhausted regular benefits.

Frostman said he understands frustration with his agency, adding that its efforts are ""starting to bear fruit"" in processing claims more quickly.

""If they’re found eligible and making their weekly claims, they’ll get every dollar they’re entitled to including back pay,"" Frostman said.

Still, he acknowledged, back payments would not fix every hardship of living months without income.

Returning To Work, But Not To Normal

The pandemic is far from over, but businesses are reopening, leaving some Wisconsinites returning to old jobs or searching for new ones.

While waiting for his claim to be adjudicated, Chris Acree learned that he is going to be a father. The Fox Valley Mall Burger King he manages in Appleton reopened in June. That will offer a financial boost, but the 33-year-old remains behind on his rent and car payments.

The Crisis Was Years In The Making. By Bram Sable-Smith Published: Monday, June 29, 2020, 12:55pm Share:    Listen Download When Fall River-based Robbins Manufacturing laid off David Ficke on March 29, the welder followed in the footsteps of hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites during the coronavirus pandemic. He filed an initial unemployment claim, hoping it would help him survive a shutdown of much of the state’s economy.  But when an early morning call to the state’s unemployment helpline placed him in a queue of 400 to 500 people, Ficke knew he would wait a long time for aid as Wisconsin’s first come, first served system drowned in a flood of claims.  Unable to pay rent at his apartment in Beaver Dam, he moved into the ""Hotel Chrysler"" — his 2006 Town and Country Touring Edition minivan. Ficke drove west to a rest stop outside of Albert Lea, Minnesota. He wanted to be near his 3-year-old daughter who was living with his ex-wife and her family.  The family soon discovered Ficke was living in his van and insisted that he stay with them. That is how he ended up living with his ex-wife, her parents and her new boyfriend.  ""It is what it is,"" Ficke, 42, said in a video interview over Facebook Messenger. Ficke could not speak over his cell phone; he lost service for lack of payment during his nearly three-month wait for jobless benefits. But he’s trying to stay positive.        When a phone call to Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance helpline placed David Ficke in a queue of 400 to 500 people, he knew he would wait a long time for aid as Wisconsin’s first-come, first-served system drowned in a flood of claims. Rather than risk eviction, Ficke, a laid-off welder, traded his apartment in Beaver Dam, Wis., for a stay at the “Hotel Chrysler” — his 2006 Town and Country minivan. Courtesy of David Ficke      ""We’re all here for our little baby,"" he said of his daughter.  Half A Million Claims Pending  The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) has paid about 2.5 million of more than 3.4 million weekly unemployment claims it received between March 15 and June 20. The agency has denied 409,000 claims and has yet to process 509,000 others, the latter of which represents about 151,000 people.  The agency added hundreds of new and reassigned workers during the pandemic to staff phone lines and process and adjudicate backlogged claims. DWD Secretary Caleb Frostman said in a June 17 interview that his agency was ""very, very close"" to resolving outstanding claims from March, the earliest days of the pandemic, and the agency is prioritizing adjudicated claims in the order they were received.  Frostman blames the slow pace on a chronically underfunded and outdated computer system and initial short staffing that left his agency ill-equipped to handle the rapid onslaught of claims. Republican lawmakers accuse Frostman and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for lacking urgency — waiting too long to expand call center hours and shift employees to address the biggest problems.  Not up for debate: that Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance system has failed to deliver for thousands of residents at a time when they most need it, leaving many to miss bill payments, rack up new credit card debt, lean on food pantries and face eviction — even homelessness.  The state’s tangled unemployment safety net has failed in a variety of ways to catch its residents, interviews with 16 laid-off workers show. Their stories highlight the difficulties of navigating the state’s unemployment system under any circumstances — let alone during a global pandemic.  Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance woes are part of a national trend, according to experts and media reports.  Pennsylvania as of mid-June still had yet to process 15 percent of claims filed in March. In Florida, which has received 2.3 million ""unique"" jobless applications, one applicant needing to provide information reported calling an assistance line as many as 400 times without getting through. Unemployment insurance applicants in Kentucky have waited outside of state offices for hours to resolve claims issues in person. Washington state called in the National Guard to address its claims backlog. The interim director of Nevada’s unemployment insurance system resigned from her post after the governor reported ""threats to her personal safety"" from frustrated claimants.  The pandemic struck after a years-long push in Wisconsin and other states to make accessing jobless benefits harder.  Just 32 percent of unemployed Wisconsin workers accessed benefits in 2016, down from 50 percent in 2007, according to a 2017 study by the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit that supports protections for low-wage workers and the unemployed. Nationally, the rate of covered unemployed workers fell from 36 percent to 27 percent over the same period.  ""Systems have been over-calibrated to prevent overpayments at the expense of paying appropriate benefits. States have programmed their computer systems to pause applications at every decision point, which can generate multiple eligibility determinations and denials,"" Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst with the unemployment law group, testified this month to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.  ""As we have seen, that is going to slow down benefits getting to the public when there is a crisis,"" Evermore said.  'Not Sure' Leads To Long Wait  Ficke’s wait for help concerns how he lost a previous welding job at Karavan Trailers in Fox Lake in 2018. Wisconsin requires unemployment insurance applicants to have worked within the past 18 months and earned enough wages. Applicants must detail that job history.  Ficke is not sure whether Karavan fired or laid him off, but his exit came as the company cut more than 50 employees at once, he recalled. The exit was not traumatic when it happened, since Ficke had already started working part time at Robbins with prospects to add more hours.  Asked on his unemployment insurance application to explain why he left Karavan, Ficke checked a box signaling he was unsure. That sent his application into an abyss of claims needing adjudication — and it required reaching an elusive DWD staffer over the phone.  ""I understand waiting four or five weeks. I get it, I do,"" Ficke said. ""But when you’re out eight, nine,10, 11 weeks, you have to be able to do something for the people.""  He added: ""We need to hold people accountable.""  Problems not new  Ficke is among many who complain of getting kicked off overwhelmed DWD phone lines while trying to resolve claims issues. The pandemic made the problem more visible, but the issue is not new.  A 2014 state audit found that DWD call centers automatically blocked 80 percent of calls during times of high volume.  ""It can be challenging for DWD to handle significant, temporary increases in calls during certain times of the year. If the steps that DWD has planned are insufficient and large numbers of calls are blocked in the coming months, DWD may need to take additional action,"" the audit said.  The audit came as Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Legislature largely focused on limiting access to unemployment insurance and reducing perceived fraud.  Beginning in 2011, the Legislature under then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, enacted a series of laws that: created a one-week waiting period for benefits (temporarily waived during the pandemic ), increased work search requirements for recipients, disqualified people on federal disability from accessing unemployment compensation and increased criminal penalties for making false statements or representations on applications.  Additionally, Walker signed a lame-duck law just before Evers took office that restricts the governor’s ability to waive certain requirements for state-federal benefits programs including unemployment insurance. And Wisconsin’s $370 a week maximum benefit is among the most miserly in the United States, ranking 40th among the states and the District of Columbia. (Through the $2 trillion CARES Act stimulus, the federal government is adding $600 to each check through July 31. )  Unemployment applicants as of June 23 spent an average of 19 days waiting for their claims to be paid, according to DWD . But people in Ficke’s shoes are waiting much longer as the agency investigates and adjudicates issues its system flags as problematic.  In May the agency announced it had contracted the firm Nelnet to provide at least 200 people to process and adjudicate claims. The agency later said Nelnet would ramp up to 300 such workers by the end of June. DWD contracted two additional vendors to add hundreds of new staff to overwhelmed phone lines. The agency received 439,000-plus unemployment insurance calls the week of June 20 alone.  All told, Frostman said the agency will be adding about 1,300 new staffers to handle the surge of claims and calls, up from 504 total unemployment insurance staff in March. But 20,000-plus people continue to file initial claims every week, only adding to the adjudication line. Many laid off workers can’t afford to wait any longer for help.        Chenon Times-Rainwater helps organize a Facebook support group for people wrangling with the state’s unemployment insurance system. Times-Rainwater waited over two months for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to process her unemployment claim. Courtesy of Chenon Times-Rainwater      That includes Chenon Times-Rainwater, a 41-year-old life coach and small business owner in West Bend. She waited more than two months for her claim. It was resolved June 26, but she said the agency did not calculate her benefits correctly. Times-Rainwater made the difficult decision during the pandemic to place her 16-year-old daughter with special needs in a group home when her family could no longer pay for caregivers to come to their house.  ""We can’t afford to pay her staff without income.""  Times-Rainwater helps organize Wisconsin Unemployment Support Group, a Facebook gathering to trade tips and moral support for folks battling DWD bureaucracy. The group has swelled to about 4,000 members during the pandemic. In her leadership role, Times-Rainwater said she has helped relocate 14 families that have lost their homes after losing jobs and lacking state aid.  Her group wants Evers to fire Frostman and Mark Reihl, DWD’s unemployment insurance administrator.  ""The incompetence and unwillingness to coordinate with other states, seek appropriate guidance, acknowledge defeat, and accept any responsibility for the ultimate failure of the DWD’s response the Covid Relief efforts are astounding,"" the group said in a press release Thursday  ""Sixteen weeks people have gone without income,"" Times-Rainwater said in an interview, ""and nobody cares.""  Wisconsin Slow To Distribute Federal Aid  Wisconsin is also distributing unemployment benefits under a separate federal program: Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Congress created the program for people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic but ""would not qualify for regular unemployment compensation.""  Congress channeled PUA funds through state unemployment insurance agencies, and Wisconsin has struggled to allocate the money to folks who need it. That includes Adriana Patino, 44, of Marshall in Dane County.  The single mother, who asked to be identified by her maiden name, earns a living transcribing and captioning off-line videos such as university lectures and work training — work that began drying up in April.        After nearly two months of waiting, Adriana Patino finally received unemployment aid in late June, but only after tragedy struck. While waiting for her claim to be reviewed, Patino learned that her eldest daughter died in Texas, and she had no money to travel to the memorial service. Courtesy of Adriana Patino      PUA was designed specifically to reach people like her; as an independent contractor, she does not qualify for traditional unemployment aid. But Patino said DWD took two months to even allow her to apply for PUA, leaving her without income and falling behind on rent and car payments. DWD eventually expedited the denial — but only after tragedy struck.  Patino previously worked for a company called CRV Holdings. She left on good terms last year to pivot to freelancing — giving her more time to care for her 5-year-old daughter. DWD doesn’t allow people to apply for PUA until the agency denies them regular benefits.  Patino’s case is not complicated in that regard; leaving a job voluntarily, even on good terms, is enough to prompt a Wisconsin claim denial. But she waited two months for DWD to deny her regular claim.  While still waiting for a denial, Patino learned that her eldest daughter died in Texas, and she had no money to travel to the memorial service, which has since been delayed to avoid spreading COVID-19. The same day she heard the terrible news, Evers’ office replied to one of her earlier emails seeking help. Patino sent a fiery follow up.  ""I ripped into them,"" she said. ""Life is unpredictable, but to assume everyone can wait (for unemployment benefits) is a guarantee that a small percentage of those folks will be affected tremendously.""  An adjudicator called the next day with news: DWD had finally denied the regular claim. That sent Patino into a new queue of people waiting on the agency to process their PUA claims.  ""What’s scary is that some of the PUA questions leave room for the adjudicator to make an assessment that could go another way if it were someone else. Mine were both very kind, but when they use terms like 'fair enough' — and your livelihood is hanging in the balance — it is unnerving,"" Patino said.  Money finally showed up in Patino’s bank account on June 22.  ""It’s just a testament to how slow the process still is, even when they do try to expedite a request from the governor’s office because of circumstances like mine,"" Patino said.  Wisconsin accepted more than 75,000 PUA claims through June 20. Congress created PUA in late March, and the U.S. Department of Labor issued administration guidance to states on April 5. But Wisconsin did not begin accepting claims until April 21, and DWD took another month to issue determinations and payments .  Frostman, the workforce secretary, said his agency needed time to interpret federal guidance for the new program. By April 27, for example, state agencies nationwide asked enough questions to prompt the labor department to update its guidance . Another obstacle Frostman cited: DWD’s 1970s-era technology , a vulnerability that lawmakers and regulators have understood for decades but never bothered to fix.  DWD planned a major overhaul of its computer system more than a decade ago, but Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration pulled the plug in 2007 as the project — contracted to two outside companies — fell behind schedule and looked poised to exceed its $24 million budget.  The agency’s IT system requires sequential testing and programming, Frostman said, meaning new benefits programs must be added to the system one at a time. That meant DWD could not program PUA rules until it finished handling other changes required by Congress and the Wisconsin Legislature. Those include the federal government’s temporary $600 weekly increase in benefits and the state’s waiver of a one-week waiting period for benefits.  The agency began accepting applications on June 24 for benefits under another federal program: Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation , which adds 13 weeks of aid for people who have exhausted regular benefits.  Frostman said he understands frustration with his agency, adding that its efforts are ""starting to bear fruit"" in processing claims more quickly.

https://www.sc.com/en/feature/what-are-the-prospects-for-chinas-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/,"More support for a sustainable domestic recovery

China’s government is prioritising social goals ahead of GDP growth by creating employment and indicating that fiscal policy will be its preferred way to stimulate the economy. Officials have suggested that they are willing to almost double the budget deficit to support gross domestic product growth, while allowing money supply and credit growth to reach higher levels. There also appears to be a clear shift in China’s strategy; moving from an export focus to paying greater attention to domestic demand, to releasing consumers’ potential, and investing in new and traditional infrastructure projects.

While the latest data shows that China’s economy shrank 6.8 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, there has been an improvement in momentum and in the leading indicators in recent months.

Standard Chartered’s monthly proprietary survey of small and medium sized businesses in China shows a recovery gaining traction. The gauge rose to 51.7 in May from 50.9 in April, and the ‘current performance’ sub-index indicated expansion for the first time in four months, suggesting an acceleration in real activity. SMEs were also optimistic about their prospects.

Even so, the recovery is not even. As large companies fare better than others, policy is tilted toward supporting SMEs, with measures including temporary tax and fee cuts and an option to delay corporate income tax payments until the first quarter of next year. SME access to credit has improved, and more policy support is likely to bring down the cost of borrowing.

Shoring up consumer confidence, spending and the services sector is key to fostering demand, and the government’s focus on stimulating employment shows they are cognisant of this.

Risks to the domestic outlook include a potential recurrence of the virus, a stronger propensity to saving and a rise in non-performing assets at banks.

While we see the debt-to-GDP ratio climbing by around 20 percentage points this year, the risk is manageable as long as it represents a temporary spike in response to the unprecedented growth challenge.

The stimulus measures should support a gradual recovery for the rest of the year, and in our base scenario, the economy could grow at a rate of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent this year.

At the same time, we recognise that while supply resumption is encouraging, export side weakness is a major downside risk to growth. Standard Chartered’s SME survey showed export orders were still contracting in May and overseas demand remained sluggish. Moving ahead, China can’t rely on short term economic stimulus and should also stimulate the creativity of the private sector and enhance productivity.

Strong external pressures, tough global environment

We are cognisant that external risks, such as trade tensions and a deeper global recession, are the biggest threats to the outlook and could put a brake on growth. Also, in the run-up to the US presidential election, blaming China has become a common strategy of both the Republican and Democratic parties, and bilateral tension could escalate on trade, investment, technology and geopolitical issues.

Should domestic and external risks materialise, growth will be lower than our central forecast. Our scenario analysis shows that if a second wave of the virus hits and the external environment and trade tensions worsen, then GDP may contract by as much as 0.5 per cent this year.

While anti-China rhetoric is likely to continue in the run-up to the US election, both sides have an interest in keeping the Phase One trade deal announced earlier this year intact, and both are likely to weigh the costs and benefits of any further action carefully.

Positive indicators of China’s recovery

Domestic fundamentals and government stimulus should help guide China back to a firm footing.

Much of the recent data looks comforting and the capital and currency markets show relative stability. Standard Chartered’s renminbi internationalisation tracker rose in March, suggesting resilience and confidence among investors, even amid the disruptions.

Most workers in the manufacturing and construction sector, one of the cornerstones of the economy, have returned to their jobs as factories work to resume normal capacity and project implementation accelerates.

While the initial signs are encouraging, there’s still some distance to go before China – and the rest of the world – is out of the woods. A broadening of the domestic recovery and an improvement in the global data would help.

Should the outlook worsen, many investors believe the government will introduce more stimulus, with 84 per cent of respondents to a Standard Chartered live poll predicting this will materialise before the end of the year.

While we don’t expect additional stimulus, this may change if there are fresh signs that the economy is faltering. China’s officials are aware of the longer-term challenges of taking on more debt to fund stimulus. However, they are leaving room for manoeuvre if it is needed.

Any more stimulus is likely to be on the fiscal side, rather than around monetary policy or credit, given that the government’s priority is to generate demand. Special bond issuance could be increased if needed and further stimulus might be directed toward funding new infrastructure projects. Credit growth is already high relative to nominal GDP, and the authorities may focus on ensuring credit is flowing to the real economy instead of circulating within the financial system.

China’s economic recovery may well be unpredictable. However, there are many reasons to be positive. While risks remain - including the re-escalation of trade tensions, another outbreak of COVID-19, and a deeper global recession - the government appears prepared to deploy more of the policy tools at its disposal. The initial data is promising, and investment and consumer confidence is improving, setting in place many of the elements for good growth.

As China plans its post COVID-19 economic recovery, here are the risks and the reasons to be optimistic.   2 June 2020              Shuang Ding     Head of Greater China Economic Research                  As China puts job creation and social stability at the centre of its plan to recover from the impact of COVID-19, what’s the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy? Here is an analysis of the government’s response, the key risks and the reasons to be optimistic that I shared with my fellow panellists at a recent webinar titled Reviving the dragon: China’s Recovery. While China’s economy is a long way from where it was before the pandemic hit, we believe that there are positive signals in much of the domestic data. Officials are firmly focused on protecting employment, livelihoods, businesses, and supply chains, as well as on utilising expansionary macro policies - putting the economy on a firm footing as it heads into the second half of the year.           What are the prospects for China’s post COVID-19 economic recovery?  Watch now   ""           More support for a sustainable domestic recovery China’s government is prioritising social goals ahead of GDP growth by creating employment and indicating that fiscal policy will be its preferred way to stimulate the economy. Officials have suggested that they are willing to almost double the budget deficit to support gross domestic product growth, while allowing money supply and credit growth to reach higher levels. There also appears to be a clear shift in China’s strategy; moving from an export focus to paying greater attention to domestic demand, to releasing consumers’ potential, and investing in new and traditional infrastructure projects. While the latest data shows that China’s economy shrank 6.8 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, there has been an improvement in momentum and in the leading indicators in recent months. Standard Chartered’s monthly proprietary survey of small and medium sized businesses in China shows a recovery gaining traction. The gauge rose to 51.7 in May from 50.9 in April, and the ‘current performance’ sub-index indicated expansion for the first time in four months, suggesting an acceleration in real activity. SMEs were also optimistic about their prospects. Even so, the recovery is not even. As large companies fare better than others, policy is tilted toward supporting SMEs, with measures including temporary tax and fee cuts and an option to delay corporate income tax payments until the first quarter of next year. SME access to credit has improved, and more policy support is likely to bring down the cost of borrowing. Shoring up consumer confidence, spending and the services sector is key to fostering demand, and the government’s focus on stimulating employment shows they are cognisant of this. Risks to the domestic outlook include a potential recurrence of the virus, a stronger propensity to saving and a rise in non-performing assets at banks. While we see the debt-to-GDP ratio climbing by around 20 percentage points this year, the risk is manageable as long as it represents a temporary spike in response to the unprecedented growth challenge. The stimulus measures should support a gradual recovery for the rest of the year, and in our base scenario, the economy could grow at a rate of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent this year. At the same time, we recognise that while supply resumption is encouraging, export side weakness is a major downside risk to growth. Standard Chartered’s SME survey showed export orders were still contracting in May and overseas demand remained sluggish. Moving ahead, China can’t rely on short term economic stimulus and should also stimulate the creativity of the private sector and enhance productivity. Strong external pressures, tough global environment We are cognisant that external risks, such as trade tensions and a deeper global recession, are the biggest threats to the outlook and could put a brake on growth. Also, in the run-up to the US presidential election, blaming China has become a common strategy of both the Republican and Democratic parties, and bilateral tension could escalate on trade, investment, technology and geopolitical issues. Should domestic and external risks materialise, growth will be lower than our central forecast. Our scenario analysis shows that if a second wave of the virus hits and the external environment and trade tensions worsen, then GDP may contract by as much as 0.5 per cent this year. While anti-China rhetoric is likely to continue in the run-up to the US election, both sides have an interest in keeping the Phase One trade deal announced earlier this year intact, and both are likely to weigh the costs and benefits of any further action carefully. Positive indicators of China’s recovery Domestic fundamentals and government stimulus should help guide China back to a firm footing. Much of the recent data looks comforting and the capital and currency markets show relative stability. Standard Chartered’s renminbi internationalisation tracker rose in March, suggesting resilience and confidence among investors, even amid the disruptions. Most workers in the manufacturing and construction sector, one of the cornerstones of the economy, have returned to their jobs as factories work to resume normal capacity and project implementation accelerates. While the initial signs are encouraging, there’s still some distance to go before China – and the rest of the world – is out of the woods. A broadening of the domestic recovery and an improvement in the global data would help. Should the outlook worsen, many investors believe the government will introduce more stimulus, with 84 per cent of respondents to a Standard Chartered live poll predicting this will materialise before the end of the year. While we don’t expect additional stimulus, this may change if there are fresh signs that the economy is faltering. China’s officials are aware of the longer-term challenges of taking on more debt to fund stimulus. However, they are leaving room for manoeuvre if it is needed. Any more stimulus is likely to be on the fiscal side, rather than around monetary policy or credit, given that the government’s priority is to generate demand. Special bond issuance could be increased if needed and further stimulus might be directed toward funding new infrastructure projects. Credit growth is already high relative to nominal GDP, and the authorities may focus on ensuring credit is flowing to the real economy instead of circulating within the financial system. China’s economic recovery may well be unpredictable. However, there are many reasons to be positive. While risks remain - including the re-escalation of trade tensions, another outbreak of COVID-19, and a deeper global recession - the government appears prepared to deploy more of the policy tools at its disposal. The initial data is promising, and investment and consumer confidence is improving, setting in place many of the elements for good growth.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/china-wont-be-able-to-bail-asia-out-this-time,"BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - As bad as China's economic dive is, the slump is even more perilous for the rest of Asia. The region stands to lose its growth patron.

China's gross domestic product fell 6.8 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the government said on Friday (April 17), the worst performance since at least 1992. Even before this dismal result, the International Monetary Fund predicted Asia would see zero growth this year.

Even flatlining sounds optimistic when you consider the role China played nursing the region through the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 and the Great Recession a decade later. During the former, China was still booming, on its way to becoming the factory of the world and its biggest exporter. Investment was pouring in as membership to the World Trade Organization beckoned. During the global financial crisis, China undertook massive stimulus that buttressed regional activity. The Asia Pacific region eked out an average growth rate of 1.3 per cent during the Asian financial crisis and 4.7 per cent through the Great Recession.

Now Beijing shows little appetite for budget-busting stimulus. Its fiscal steps in response to the pandemic account for about 3 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics. That's tiny relative to the 10 per cent and 20 per cent unveiled by Washington and Tokyo, respectively. And while the central bank continues to nudge borrowing costs lower, its steps appear restrained compared with the array of tools being deployed around the world.

What explains this reluctance? China turned to open-slather spending after the global financial crisis. That spree fueled a rebound and buttressed Asia, but it also saddled banks and companies with huge debts. Total debt to GDP, including the financial sector, ballooned to about 300 per cent in 2019 from about 173 per cent in 2008, according to the Institute of International Finance.

All this means the rest of the region can't expect much to trickle through. ""China won't bail out Asia this time,"" Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, said in an interview on Thursday on Bloomberg Television.

China may well end up doing more if the recovery scenarios look to be in doubt. The IMF predicts 1.2 per cent growth for the full year, rising to 9.2 per cent in 2021. Keep in mind, too, there's often a lot of padding in stimulus packages elsewhere, with tax incentives and grants included in attention-grabbing headlines. This is particularly true of Japan, where money that hasn't been distributed previously often gets thrown in.

Before the pandemic, China largely succeeded in pulling back some of the practices that fueled its debt buildup, which naturally led to slower growth. But few observers were ready for very low single-digit numbers - the kind not out of place in the US or Europe - to come so soon. Among the scenarios the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development sketched out for the world in 2060 was the prospect that growth rates in the US and China would start converging in 2030, averaging at just under 2 per cent a year. The report was written in 2018. The coronavirus will only bring forward this outcome.

China's transformation over the past four decades from Mao-era basket case to the world's second-largest economy has been a vital ingredient in Asia's rise, especially after Japan's ascent stalled in the early 1990s. To say the Covid-19 pandemic halted this in its tracks is an understatement. China's future has arrived, and Asia will be the weaker for it.

Hassett is one of several economic aides to signal their departures over the past month. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Jeff Stein Jeff Stein Email Bio Follow June 29, 2020 at 5:10 PM EDT The Trump administration is facing an exodus of at least a half-dozen senior economic officials even as the economy remains trapped in one of the most turbulent periods in decades. Bimal Patel, a top deputy to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is departing the administration, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Patel, who will leave at the end of this week, has played a key role in overseeing the administration’s $500 billion small-business rescue program and helps lead Treasury’s efforts related to the banking system. Support our journalism. Subscribe today. He is the third senior economic adviser in the past week to signal plans to leave the Trump administration, and others have left their roles in the past month. Patel was sworn in to the Treasury post in June 2019. AD AD Patel’s planned exit comes as the financial system faces threats from growing signs that many homeowners may not pay their mortgages and some companies may declare bankruptcy or tap out their credit lines. The changes also come at a precarious moment for the U.S. economy, with a spike in coronavirus cases threatening to stall activity and large amounts of federal stimulus aid set to expire . The departures come roughly five months before the 2020 presidential election, and senior officials typically face pressure to stay on through Election Day. Over the past month, the White House has also announced the departures of Andrew Olmem, who was deputy director of the White House National Economic Counsel; Eric Ueland, who served as the White House director of legislative affairs and played a key role in negotiations with Congress over the stimulus; Kevin Hassett, who was a senior White House economic official; and Tomas J. Philipson, who served as acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. A second senior economist is abruptly leaving the White House amid ongoing economic crisis “Patel’s departure is concerning because there is still risk to the financial system, although it’s diminished over the last several months,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a former Obama administration economist, who noted the financial system is in better shape now because of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve and Treasury. “It’s not ‘Mission Accomplished’ yet.” AD AD The departures add an additional set of challenges to the administration’s daunting task of stabilizing the economy ahead of the 2020 presidential election. President Trump and senior officials have promised a swift rebound as public health restrictions are relaxed, but a spike in coronavirus cases and persistently high unemployment claims threaten the lives of tens of millions of Americans. Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, expressed confidence on Monday in a rapid economic recovery and said “the overwhelming evidence is that we’re in V-shaped recovery.” Kudlow also said news of the administration’s economic departures amounted to “gossip” and that The Washington Post’s reporting about the departures were “inaccurate.” A White House spokesman did not return requests for clarification about Kudlow’s comments. AD AD “Not only do we have a solid staff, Steve Mnuchin is still at Treasury; I’m still at the NEC; we can call Kevin Hassett whenever we want,” Kudlow told reporters. “CEA staff is doing a great job under Tyler Goodbody,” Kudlow added, an apparent reference to CEA economic official Tyler Goodspeed. White House officials have also disputed that the departures reflected dissatisfaction with working for the administration or a pessimistic outlook about the 2020 election. Hassett has said he was always planning on returning to the White House for a short time to help with the worst part of the pandemic. Olmem started at the beginning of the administration and has already been replaced by longtime White House policy adviser Francis Brooke. White House divisions sow confusion about strategy on stimulus next steps Philipson clashed with administration officials during his tenure and did not have a strong working relationship with the president or a major role in crafting economic policy. The White House Council of Economic Advisers will probably have a greater role in forming administration policy now that Philipson has departed, according to one person familiar with internal administration matters who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly. Philipson did not return requests for comment. AD AD Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee, said he has talked to multiple White House economic officials who have expressed frustration about a lack of direction and guidance on economic policy matters, particularly about the administration’s strategy for reopening the country. “It reflects a great deal of confusion about the path going forward by the Republican economists there and the terrible situation we find ourselves in,” Hoagland said of the departures. “It’s a high level of frustration, especially at the career staff level.” Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter It is unclear whether the absences will weaken the administration’s capacity to craft further response measures to the economic crisis. The most important official in creating economic policy, Mnuchin, has said he will stay on through the election. Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, is also viewed as unlikely to depart the administration before the election. AD AD Philipson’s departure is viewed by administration officials as likely to empower Goodspeed, the remaining member of the Council of Economic Advisers and a former economics professor at the University of Oxford. Goodspeed is seen by some as a possible successor to the top economic post and is viewed as well-liked across much of the administration. The White House economic team has not been unified in recent weeks as they have debated what to do next about the economy. Sharp White House divisions have emerged over the next round of stimulus spending, with conservative advisers wanting to spend less money and other administration officials pushing for enough to offset the downturn. The White House has not taken official positions on a range of key economic policy matters still being debated and has confused lawmakers with conflicting signals. White House officials have, for instance, signaled that they are deferring to Congress on small-business relief in the next stimulus package, according to one person in communication with lawmakers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. AD AD Some White House officials have privately described being frustrated by the departures but driven by a sense of civic obligation to continue during the perilous economic moment, according to interviews with multiple people in communication with administration officials. Conservative groups are beginning to draw up lists of potential candidates to fill Philipson’s position, one person familiar with the matter said. Two people familiar with the matter said he had been forced out of the administration. Philipson told the Wall Street Journal that he had grown “frustrated with the process of advising the president” and was excluded by “weak advisers.” In the statement announcing his departure, Philipson said he was leaving after three years “in time to retain my tenured position at the University of Chicago.” A University of Chicago spokesman said Philipson is returning from leave this fall.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-30/stark-statistics-reveal-precarious-position-of-women/12404274,"At Helensburgh, south of Sydney, Margaret Hunt is heading off to work.

She's a home care worker, who assists the disabled and the elderly — an essential service that helps vulnerable people live independently.

Since COVID-19 struck, Ms Hunt has lost a third of her paid work, as clients with compromised health isolate and rely on family.

""So, my hours went down from 55-60 hours a fortnight to maybe 35-40,"" she tells the ABC.

Pay rates in her industry are so low that it has left her in the unenviable situation of receiving less than those on social welfare who have no work at all.

""I would be better off on JobSeeker if I could get it,"" she says.

""Better off on unemployment benefits the way they are at the moment.""

Margaret Hunt's plight highlights a key feature of this recession: it's had a disproportionate impact on women — over-represented among the underemployed and in jobs that are often precarious and under-valued.

""It really is a gendered outcome,"" says Professor Marian Baird, who heads the discipline of work at the University of Sydney.

Professor Marian Baird says investing stimulus in social infrastructure would deliver a greater return. ( ABC News: John Gunn )

""We've seen women lose hours of work [in higher proportions than men], they are far more likely to be on zero-hours jobs than men, and secondly, they are far more likely not to be eligible for JobKeeper — so women are really doing it hard in this recession.""

The psychological toll on women has been high too and it has manifested in surprising outcomes.

""It is really quite astonishing actually how this recession has impacted on women and men quite differently,"" observes Professor Baird.

She cites ABS statistics showing women are suffering higher levels of loneliness.

Women have turned to ""what might be seen as ways to soothe their loneliness"", she says, far more than men, increasing their intake of medicines, vitamins … and alcohol.

Women reaching for the bottle has been attributed by some researchers to the twin burden of caring responsibilities and working from home.

But perhaps it is also a symptom of the economic pain of working in low-paid, ""casualised"" industries, where many workers — unable to qualify for the Government's JobKeeper — have been cast out of work.

Survey shows how inhospitable hospitality is

Hospo Voice, a division of the United Workers Union, recently surveyed 1,100 workers from the hospitality industry, where the majority of employees are women and nearly 80 per cent of workers are casual.

The findings were stark.

• 35 per cent said they had to borrow money from friends or family to survive

• 32 per cent had to access super

• 30 per cent had to ask for rent reduction or deferral

• 20 per cent had to go without essentials

• 12 per cent had to turn to charity or a foodbank

• 7 per cent suffered a relationship breakdown

• 7 in 10 were not eligible for JobKeeper

""COVID has underlined existing inequalities in the labour market and vulnerabilities for women,"" says Jo Schofield, national president of the United Workers Union, which represents a range of female-dominated industries including hospitality, aged care, home care, and early childhood education and care.

""What you have seen with hospitality is a mindset that this workforce is disposable.

""Before COVID, these were workers in highly insecure casualised jobs that were low paid. They were also working in a sector that had some of the most egregious forms of wage theft in our economy.""

Claudia Levi knows this all too well. Like so many in the sector, Ms Levi has been paid illegally low wages during her career in hospitality — at one stage, a $19-a-week flat rate including weekends, far under the lawful award wage.

She was working as a supervisor at a cafe and event centre in Brunswick, Melbourne, before the pandemic put paid to that income.

""I walked in to start my shift and the owner was there and he said, 'No we are not opening today,' and that was it — never heard from them again,"" she remembers.

""Unfortunately, that's left me with massive bills and no security"", and stress and worry that the establishment may not remain in business to pursue for underpaid wages.

'Hard hats and high vis' attract stimulus dollars

Jo Schofield describes the Government's decision to exclude casual workers from the JobKeeper wage subsidy as gender blind, along with its decision to make old-style infrastructure projects and subsidies for construction a mainstay of the economic stimulus.

Professor Baird agrees.

""Look, the response has been almost a classic, textbook, old-fashioned response of, 'We'll boost the economy through jobs that are for the hard hats and the high-vis vests,'"" she says.

""This is really the wrong way to go and we know from a lot of modelling that you get much more return on your investment these days if you invest in the social infrastructure — care, education, hospitality.""

Committed to her vulnerable clients, Ms Hunt has soldiered on during the disease outbreak, despite the risks to her own health.

She's a home care worker, who assists the disabled and the elderly — an essential service that helps vulnerable people live independently. Since COVID-19 struck, Ms Hunt has lost a third of her paid work, as clients with compromised health isolate and rely on family. ""So, my hours went down from 55-60 hours a fortnight to maybe 35-40,"" she tells the ABC. Pay rates in her industry are so low that it has left her in the unenviable situation of receiving less than those on social welfare who have no work at all. ""I would be better off on JobSeeker if I could get it,"" she says. ""Better off on unemployment benefits the way they are at the moment."" Margaret Hunt's plight highlights a key feature of this recession: it's had a disproportionate impact on women — over-represented among the underemployed and in jobs that are often precarious and under-valued. ""It really is a gendered outcome,"" says Professor Marian Baird, who heads the discipline of work at the University of Sydney.  Professor Marian Baird says investing stimulus in social infrastructure would deliver a greater return. ( ABC News: John Gunn ) ""We've seen women lose hours of work [in higher proportions than men], they are far more likely to be on zero-hours jobs than men, and secondly, they are far more likely not to be eligible for JobKeeper — so women are really doing it hard in this recession."" The psychological toll on women has been high too and it has manifested in surprising outcomes. Coronavirus has left women anxious Australian women are overworked, insecure — and worse off than men again, writes Annabel Crabb. Read more ""It is really quite astonishing actually how this recession has impacted on women and men quite differently,"" observes Professor Baird. She cites ABS statistics showing women are suffering higher levels of loneliness. Women have turned to ""what might be seen as ways to soothe their loneliness"", she says, far more than men, increasing their intake of medicines, vitamins … and alcohol. Women reaching for the bottle has been attributed by some researchers to the twin burden of caring responsibilities and working from home.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/politics/fauci-redford-testimony-senate-coronavirus/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci issued a stark warning on Tuesday to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, telling them he wouldn't be surprised if the US sees new cases of coronavirus rising to a level of 100,000 a day.

""We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around and so I am very concerned,"" Fauci told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee during a hearing on the pandemic on Tuesday.

Fauci expressed dismay over people congregating in crowds and not wearing masks and inadequate attention being paid to guidelines on reopening.

""We're going to continue to be in a lot of trouble, and there's going to be a lot of hurt if that does not stop,"" he said.

The urgent message came during a hearing on the latest efforts by the US government to contain the pandemic, as several states struggle to contain the virus amid rising cases and state reopenings. The US reported more than 40,000 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, its biggest daily jump yet.

Asked if the pandemic is under control, Fauci said, ""I am not satisfied with what's going on because we are going in the wrong direction if you look at the curves of the new cases, so we've really got to do something about that and we need to do it quickly,"" adding, ""Clearly we are not in total control right now.""

Fauci said that he can't make an accurate prediction of the number of cases and deaths the US will see before the pandemic is over, but said, ""It's going to be very disturbing, I will guarantee you that.""

Fauci, Redfield urge American public to wear masks

Fauci and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield stressed the importance of wearing masks during testimony before a Senate committee on Tuesday, with Fauci saying ""we recommend masks for everyone"" and ""masks are extremely important.""

Redfield singled out younger Americans in particular to deliver a message that they are not exempt from the necessity of wearing a mask.

""It is critical that we all take the personal responsibility to slow the transmission of Covid-19 and embrace the universal use of face coverings,"" he said. ""Specifically, I'm addressing the younger members of our society, the Millennials and the Generation Zs -- I ask those that are listening to spread the word.""

Fauci spoke of the across-the-board importance of wearing masks.

""We are all in this together,"" he said, adding, ""We recommend masks for everyone on the outside, anyone who comes into contact in a crowded area. You should avoid crowds where possible and when you're outside and not have the capability of maintaining distance, you should wear a mask at all times.""

Fauci indicated that he would support an effort to increase the production of high-quality masks in the US and distribute them free of charge to the American public in response to a question from Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.

""Masks are extremely important,"" Fauci said, adding, ""There's no doubt that wearing masks protects you and gets you to be protected. So it's people protecting each other. Anything that furthers the use of masks, whether it's giving out free masks or any other mechanism, I am thoroughly in favor of.""

More than half of all states are seeing a rise in cases, and Florida, Texas and Arizona are getting hit particularly hard. Texas has begun scaling back its reopening, and beaches in Florida have closed for the upcoming holiday weekend.

Experts testify on vaccine development as the FDA gets more involved

Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said the FDA is taking action to help coronavirus vaccine developers get through the approval process faster.

""I am pleased to announce that today, FDA is taking action to aid the timely development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent Covid-19 by providing guidance for developers, with recommendations on the data needed to facilitate manufacturing, clinical development, and approval,"" he said.

Hahn said the FDA is committed to ""help expedite this work,"" but added, ""We will not cut corners in our decision making.""

Hahn said the guidance will ""provide regulatory clarity around what FDA expects with respect to those data. We want to see certain parts of those data so that we can demonstrate to the world, to the nation, to the American people, that we are following our rigorous standards with respect to safety and efficacy.""

""This is particularly as important as we know that some people are skeptical of vaccine development efforts,"" he continued, adding that ""public confidence in vaccines is so important.""

Separately, Redfield said there was ""substantial disappointment with American Airlines"" when the airline announced it would stop limiting seat sales on airlines.

""I can tell you that when they announced that the other day, obviously there was substantial disappointment with American Airlines,"" Redfield said. ""I can say this is under critical review right now by us at CDC. We don't think it's the right message.""

Last week, American Airlines said it plans to begin selling every seat on flights, something it has not done since the pandemic struck this spring.

The airline responded to criticism of the decision, saying in a statement Tuesday that it is committed to the ""safety and well-being of (its) customers and team members."" The airline said that it has ""multiple layers of protection"" for passengers and that it provides flexibility to those who want to change flights.

Experts promise increased testing

Fauci and Redfield testified before lawmakers last week, when Fauci said ""we're going to be doing more testing, not less,"" in response to President Donald Trump's recent claim that he asked his administration to slow down testing during the pandemic.

Senators have been weighing another stimulus package in recent weeks as unemployment numbers remain worrisome and economic hardship stemming from the pandemic persists. Republicans remains divided on the size and scale of the next stimulus bill and while it has been discussed for months, the next phase of economic relief is still weeks away. But there is now broad agreement something has to be done -- something that wasn't always the case.

In Capitol Hill's last round of aid, Congress boosted unemployment checks by $600 a week and added 13 weeks of pay, beyond what states offer. The additional money will expire on July 31 without congressional action, but the 13-week extension will remain in place until the end of the year. A second round of stimulus payments is on the negotiating table in Washington, but some of the 160 million Americans who got money the first time could be left out, according a more targeted approach the administration is pushing for.

Republicans have zeroed in on the last week of July to reach agreement on the next round of stimulus legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant for weeks on that timeline and the administration is on board.

https://www.gov.scot/news/blueprint-for-economic-recovery/,"Scotland sets out ‘bold and practical’ proposals,

A UK-wide £80 billion stimulus package should be created to regenerate the economy and reduce inequalities following the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a new Scottish Government report proposes.

The package could finance a temporary reduction in VAT and move the tourism and hospitality industries onto a reduced VAT rate of five per cent.

A two pence cut in employers’ National Insurance Contributions to reduce the cost of hiring staff is also recommended in the report, entitled COVID-19: UK Fiscal Path – A New Approach.

Other action it proposes the UK Government should take to kick-start the economy includes:

introduce a jobs guarantee scheme for young people and extend sector-specific employment and business support schemes

create a National Debt Plan to help business and household budgets recover from the effects of the pandemic

adopt new fiscal rules which prioritise economic stimulus over deficit reduction in times of crisis

accelerate major investment in low‑carbon initiatives, energy efficiency and digital infrastructure

extend Scotland’s financial powers to allow it to shape its own response to the pandemic

The report was launched today by Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.

Ms Forbes said:

“We are emerging from the biggest economic shock of our lifetimes. It has hit the most vulnerable in our society disproportionately and presents challenges that the Scottish Government does not currently have the powers to meet.

“The UK Government’s fiscal policies are still key in determining our budget, so today we set out the principles we believe it should follow to ensure we emerge with a fairer, greener economy that values wellbeing alongside growth.

“This report recommends bold, practical steps which would provide an immediate boost to our economy, protect existing jobs and deliver new ones. It tackles public debt, employment and proposes measures to further support business. Crucially, it avoids any return to austerity. Economic stimulus must be prioritised over deficit reduction until the recovery has fully taken hold.

“Germany has already adopted a similar-size stimulus package, representing four per cent of GDP, and the UK Government needs to be similarly positive, proactive and ambitious.

“Action is needed now. If the UK Government is not prepared to respond then Scotland must have the additional financial powers required to secure a sustainable economic recovery.

“Without those powers we will be at a severe disadvantage to other nations. It would be like trying to chart our way to recovery with one hand tied behind our back.”

The package could finance a temporary reduction in VAT and move the tourism and hospitality industries onto a reduced VAT rate of five per cent.  A two pence cut in employers’ National Insurance Contributions to reduce the cost of hiring staff is also recommended in the report, entitled COVID-19: UK Fiscal Path – A New Approach.  Other action it proposes the UK Government should take to kick-start the economy includes:   introduce a jobs guarantee scheme for young people and extend sector-specific employment and business support schemes    create a National Debt Plan to help business and household budgets recover from the effects of the pandemic    adopt new fiscal rules which prioritise economic stimulus over deficit reduction in times of crisis    accelerate major investment in low‑carbon initiatives, energy efficiency and digital infrastructure    extend Scotland’s financial powers to allow it to shape its own response to the pandemic   The report was launched today by Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.  Ms Forbes said:  “We are emerging from the biggest economic shock of our lifetimes. It has hit the most vulnerable in our society disproportionately and presents challenges that the Scottish Government does not currently have the powers to meet.  “The UK Government’s fiscal policies are still key in determining our budget, so today we set out the principles we believe it should follow to ensure we emerge with a fairer, greener economy that values wellbeing alongside growth.  “This report recommends bold, practical steps which would provide an immediate boost to our economy, protect existing jobs and deliver new ones. It tackles public debt, employment and proposes measures to further support business. Crucially, it avoids any return to austerity. Economic stimulus must be prioritised over deficit reduction until the recovery has fully taken hold.  “Germany has already adopted a similar-size stimulus package, representing four per cent of GDP, and the UK Government needs to be similarly positive, proactive and ambitious.  “Action is needed now. If the UK Government is not prepared to respond then Scotland must have the additional financial powers required to secure a sustainable economic recovery.  “Without those powers we will be at a severe disadvantage to other nations. It would be like trying to chart our way to recovery with one hand tied behind our back.”  Background  COVID-19: UK Fiscal Path – A New Approach is published online.

https://time.com/5861295/masks-covid19-spread-fighting/,"At long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true.

We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger.

If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.

I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity.

In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19.

Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. Taking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats.

As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work.

Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask.

That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths.

So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. What they don’t seem to get is that while masks may protect the wearer, the more important reason for wearing them is to protect others. If you are infected but don’t know it—because you have no symptoms (“asymptomatic infection”) or the symptoms have not yet appeared (“pre-symptomatic infection”)—a mask reduces the risk that you will spread the virus to others around you.

What’s more, the higher the proportion of people who wear masks, the lower the risk that the coronavirus will spread through the community, akin to herd immunity after vaccination. Once a certain percentage of people, known as a “herd,” is vaccinated (e.g. 95% in the case of measles vaccine), then the unvaccinated people also become protected. Similarly, mass masking provides benefits across a whole community.

This is why it is so important for governments to issue and enforce mask mandates. Not surprisingly, the rate of mask use is much higher in states with mandates. The highest rates of mask use (60%-70%) are in the Northeast—Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, all of which have statewide mandates. The lowest rates (under 10%) are in Arizona, Indiana and Tennessee, none of which have state mandates.

COVID-19 cases are on the rise in again 31 states—and growing exponentially in crisis states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida that acted much too quickly to reopen businesses. The only way to control the dramatic rise in these “humanitarian catastrophe” states will be to reinstate full lockdowns and mandatory social distancing. Mass masking isn’t the way to end a huge surge in COVID-19. Instead, it is one of the ways that we can help avoid repeated cycles of lockdown and release. There is plenty of evidence from countries around the world that widespread mask wearing—in combination with 2 meters of social distancing, handwashing, and track and trace testing—will allow us to more safely do the things we so desperately want and need to do: go back to work, reopen schools, see friends and family, and restart our economy.

But to have any success, we need to reframe and depoliticize the wearing of face masks. I have been encouraged to see some Republicans—including Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Arnold Schwarzenegger and even Dick Cheney—publicly endorse the importance of wearing masks. That support needs to gain steam in state legislatures and governor’s offices. Leaders further need to strongly and publicly condemn the fringe who are spreading misinformation about masks and openly flouting public health guidelines.

Wearing a face mask is not a sign of weakness. It is an act of solidarity, an expression that all of us—Democrats, Republicans and Independents—have a role to play in defeating one of the greatest public health challenges we have faced in our lifetimes.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20200630a.htm,"Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today to discuss the extraordinary challenges our nation is facing and the steps we are taking to address them.

We meet as the pandemic continues to cause tremendous hardship, taking lives and livelihoods both at home and around the world. This is a global public health crisis, and we remain grateful to our health-care professionals for delivering the most important response, and to our essential workers who help us meet our daily needs. These dedicated people put themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country.

Beginning in March, the virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread induced a sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real gross domestic product, or GDP, in the second quarter is likely to be the largest on record. The arrival of the pandemic gave rise to tremendous strains in some essential financial markets, impairing the flow of credit in the economy and threatening an even greater weakening of economic activity and loss of jobs.

The crisis was met by swift and forceful policy action across the government, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). This direct support is making a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.

As the economy reopens, incoming data are beginning to reflect a resumption of economic activity: Many businesses are opening their doors, hiring is picking up, and spending is increasing. Employment moved higher, and consumer spending rebounded strongly in May. We have entered an important new phase and have done so sooner than expected. While this bounceback in economic activity is welcome, it also presents new challenges—notably, the need to keep the virus in check.

While recent economic data offer some positive signs, we are keeping in mind that more than 20 million Americans have lost their jobs, and that the pain has not been evenly spread. The rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics. This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.

Output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels. The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus. A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.

The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.

The Federal Reserve's response to these extraordinary developments has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people as well as our role in fostering the stability of the financial system. Our actions and programs directly support the flow of credit to households, to businesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. These programs benefit Main Street by providing financing where it is not otherwise available, helping employers to keep their workers, and allowing consumers to continue spending. In many cases, by serving as a backstop to key financial markets, the programs help increase the willingness of private lenders to extend credit and ease financial conditions for families and businesses across the country. The passage of the CARES Act by Congress was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of these lending programs. We are strongly committed to using these programs, as well as our other tools, to do what we can to provide stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.

In discussing the actions we have taken, I will begin with monetary policy. In March, we lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, and we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.

In addition to these steps, we took forceful measures in four areas: open market operations to restore market functioning; actions to improve liquidity conditions in short-term funding markets; programs, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to facilitate more directly the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments; and measures to encourage banks to use their substantial capital and liquidity buffers built up over the past decade to support the economy during this difficult time.

Let me now turn to our open market operations. As tensions and uncertainty rose in mid-March, investors moved rapidly toward cash and shorter-term government securities, and the markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, started to experience strains. These markets are critical to the overall functioning of the financial system and to the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy. In response, the Federal Open Market Committee purchased Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. With these purchases, market conditions improved substantially, and in early April we began to gradually reduce our pace of purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS over the coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.

Amid the tensions and uncertainties of mid-March and as a more adverse outlook for the economy took hold, investors exhibited greater risk aversion and pulled away from longer-term and riskier assets as well as from some money market mutual funds. To help stabilize short-term funding markets, we lengthened the term and lowered the rate on discount window loans to depository institutions. The Board also established, with the approval of the Treasury Department, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) under our emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Under the PDCF, the Federal Reserve provides loans against good collateral to primary dealers that are critical intermediaries in short-term funding markets. Similar to the large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS that I mentioned earlier, this facility helps restore normal market functioning.

In addition, under section 13(3) and together with the Treasury Department, we set up the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, or CPFF, and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or MMLF. Millions of Americans put their savings into these markets, and employers use them to secure short-term funding to meet payroll and support their operations. Both of these facilities have equity provided by the Treasury Department to protect the Federal Reserve from losses. After the announcement and implementation of these facilities, indicators of market functioning in commercial paper and other short-term funding markets improved substantially, and rapid outflows from prime and tax-exempt money market funds stopped.

In mid-March, offshore U.S. dollar funding markets also came under stress. In response, the Federal Reserve and several other central banks announced the expansion and enhancement of dollar liquidity swap lines. In addition, the Federal Reserve introduced a new temporary Treasury repurchase agreement facility for foreign monetary authorities. These actions helped stabilize global U.S. dollar funding markets, and they continue to support the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury and other financial markets as well as U.S. economic conditions.

As it became clear the pandemic would significantly disrupt economies around the world, markets for longer-term debt also faced strains. The cost of borrowing rose sharply for those issuing corporate bonds, municipal debt, and asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by consumer and small business loans. In effect, creditworthy households, businesses, and state and local governments were unable to borrow at reasonable rates and other terms, which would have further reduced economic activity. In addition, small and medium-sized businesses that traditionally rely on bank lending faced large increases in their funding needs as measures taken to contain the spread of the virus forced them to temporarily close or limit operations, substantially curtailing revenues.

To support the longer-term financing that is critical to economic activity, the Federal Reserve, in cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and using equity provided for that purpose under the CARES Act, announced a number of emergency lending facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. These facilities are designed to ensure that credit would flow to borrowers and thus support economic activity.

On March 23, the Board announced that it would support consumer and business lending by establishing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The TALF is authorized to extend up to $100 billion in loans and is backed by $10 billion in CARES Act equity. This facility lends against top-rated securities backed by auto loans, credit card loans, other consumer and business loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other assets. The TALF supports credit access by consumers and businesses and provides liquidity to the broader ABS market. The facility made its first loans on June 25, and, to date, has extended $252 million in loans to eligible borrowers. Since the TALF was announced, ABS spreads have contracted significantly. Thus, the facility might be used relatively little and mainly serve as a backstop, assuring lenders that they will have access to funding and giving them the confidence to make loans to households and businesses.

To support the credit needs of large employers, the Federal Reserve also established the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF). These facilities primarily purchase bonds issued by U.S. companies that were investment grade on March 22, 2020. The two facilities have a combined purchase capacity of up to $750 billion and are backed by $75 billion in CARES Act equity. Final terms and operational details on the PMCCF were announced on June 29, and it stands ready to purchase newly issued corporate bonds and syndicated loans, serving as a backstop for businesses seeking to refinance their existing credit or obtain new funding. The SMCCF buys outstanding corporate bonds and shares in corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to facilitate smooth functioning of the secondary market. The SMCCF complements the PMCCF, because improvements in secondary-market functioning associated with the SMCCF facilitate access by companies to bond and loan markets on reasonable terms. The SMCCF launched with ETF purchases on May 12. Earlier this month, the facility began gradually reducing purchases of ETFs as it started buying a broad and diversified portfolio of individual corporate bonds to more directly support smooth functioning and market liquidity in the secondary market. Purchase volumes are tied to market functioning and are currently at very low levels. The facility currently holds a total of about $10 billion in bonds and ETF shares.

Following the announcement of the two corporate credit facilities in late March, conditions in the corporate bond market improved significantly. Credit spreads on investment-grade bonds retraced much of the widening experienced in February and March, and issuance in the primary market rebounded strongly. In the secondary market, liquidity also improved, and by mid-April, flows out of mutual funds and ETFs specializing in corporate bonds reversed.1

The Federal Reserve also launched the Main Street Lending Program, which is designed to provide loans to small and medium-sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the pandemic; such firms generally are dependent on bank lending for credit because they are too small to tap bond markets directly. Under the Main Street program, banks originate new loans or increase the size of existing loans to eligible businesses and sell loan participations to the Federal Reserve. The facility is backed by $75 billion in CARES Act equity and can purchase up to $600 billion in loan participations. The Federal Reserve has published all of the legal documents that borrowers and lenders will need to sign under the program and lender registration began on June 15. Loan participations will be purchased soon. Additionally, the Federal Reserve recently sought feedback on a proposal to expand the Main Street program to include loans made to small and medium-sized nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals and universities. Nonprofits provide vital services around the country, and the program would likewise offer them support.

While businesses in certain sectors that were particularly hard hit by the pandemic have reported continued difficulty in accessing credit, the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which draws from existing bank lines, has apparently met the immediate credit needs of many small businesses. In the months ahead, Main Street loans may prove a valuable resource for firms that were in sound financial condition prior to the pandemic.

To bolster the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's PPP, on April 16, the Federal Reserve launched the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. The facility supplies liquidity to lenders backed by their PPP loans to small businesses and has the capacity to lend up to the full amount of the PPP. As of last week, the facility held over $65 billion in outstanding term loans to participating financial institutions. The most recent monthly survey from the National Federation of Independent Business released in May indicates that small businesses have been able to meet their funding needs in recent months largely due to the PPP.2

To help state and local governments better manage cash flow pressures in order to continue to serve households and businesses in their communities, the Federal Reserve, together with the Treasury Department, established the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF). The MLF is backed by $35 billion of CARES Act equity and has the capacity to purchase up to $500 billion of short-term debt directly from U.S. states, counties, cities, and certain multistate entities. The facility became operational on May 26, and, to date, the MLF has purchased $1.2 billion worth of short-term municipal debt. With the MLF and other facilities in place as a backstop to the private market, many parts of the municipal bond market have significantly recovered from the unprecedented stress experienced earlier this year. Municipal bond yields have declined considerably, issuance has been robust over the past two months, and market conditions have improved.3

The tools that the Federal Reserve is using under its 13(3) authority are for times of emergency, such as the ones we have been living through. When economic and financial conditions improve, we will put these tools back in the toolbox.

The final area where we took steps was in bank regulation. The Board made several adjustments, many temporary, to encourage banks to use their positions of strength to support households and businesses. Unlike the 2008 financial crisis, banks entered this period with substantial capital and liquidity buffers and improved risk-management and operational resiliency. As a result, they have been well positioned to cushion the financial shocks we are seeing. In contrast to the 2008 crisis when banks pulled back from lending and amplified the economic shock, in this crisis they have greatly expanded loans to customers and have helped support the economy.

The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with an important mission, and we have taken unprecedented steps in very rapid fashion over the past few months. In doing so, we embrace our responsibility to the American people to be as transparent as possible. With regard to the facilities backed by equity from the CARES Act, we have conducted broad outreach and sought public input that has been crucial in their development. For example, in response to comments received, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have made a number of changes to expand the scope of the Main Street Lending Program to cover a broader range of borrowers and to increase the flexibility of loan terms. And we are now disclosing and will continue to disclose, on a monthly basis, names and details of participants in each facility; amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and overall costs, revenues, and fees for each of these facilities.

We recognize that our actions are only part of a broader public-sector response. Congress's passage of the CARES Act was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of the lending programs. The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy. We understand that the work of the Federal Reserve touches communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.

Thank you. I'd be happy to take your questions.

June 30, 2020  Coronavirus and CARES Act  Chair Jerome H. Powell  Before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.    Share                          Watch Live      Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today to discuss the extraordinary challenges our nation is facing and the steps we are taking to address them.  We meet as the pandemic continues to cause tremendous hardship, taking lives and livelihoods both at home and around the world. This is a global public health crisis, and we remain grateful to our health-care professionals for delivering the most important response, and to our essential workers who help us meet our daily needs. These dedicated people put themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country.  Beginning in March, the virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread induced a sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real gross domestic product, or GDP, in the second quarter is likely to be the largest on record. The arrival of the pandemic gave rise to tremendous strains in some essential financial markets, impairing the flow of credit in the economy and threatening an even greater weakening of economic activity and loss of jobs.  The crisis was met by swift and forceful policy action across the government, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). This direct support is making a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.  As the economy reopens, incoming data are beginning to reflect a resumption of economic activity: Many businesses are opening their doors, hiring is picking up, and spending is increasing. Employment moved higher, and consumer spending rebounded strongly in May. We have entered an important new phase and have done so sooner than expected. While this bounceback in economic activity is welcome, it also presents new challenges—notably, the need to keep the virus in check.  While recent economic data offer some positive signs, we are keeping in mind that more than 20 million Americans have lost their jobs, and that the pain has not been evenly spread. The rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics. This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.  Output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels. The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus. A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.  The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.  The Federal Reserve's response to these extraordinary developments has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people as well as our role in fostering the stability of the financial system. Our actions and programs directly support the flow of credit to households, to businesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. These programs benefit Main Street by providing financing where it is not otherwise available, helping employers to keep their workers, and allowing consumers to continue spending. In many cases, by serving as a backstop to key financial markets, the programs help increase the willingness of private lenders to extend credit and ease financial conditions for families and businesses across the country. The passage of the CARES Act by Congress was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of these lending programs. We are strongly committed to using these programs, as well as our other tools, to do what we can to provide stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  In discussing the actions we have taken, I will begin with monetary policy. In March, we lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, and we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  In addition to these steps, we took forceful measures in four areas: open market operations to restore market functioning; actions to improve liquidity conditions in short-term funding markets; programs, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to facilitate more directly the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments; and measures to encourage banks to use their substantial capital and liquidity buffers built up over the past decade to support the economy during this difficult time.  Let me now turn to our open market operations. As tensions and uncertainty rose in mid-March, investors moved rapidly toward cash and shorter-term government securities, and the markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, started to experience strains. These markets are critical to the overall functioning of the financial system and to the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy. In response, the Federal Open Market Committee purchased Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. With these purchases, market conditions improved substantially, and in early April we began to gradually reduce our pace of purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS over the coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.  Amid the tensions and uncertainties of mid-March and as a more adverse outlook for the economy took hold, investors exhibited greater risk aversion and pulled away from longer-term and riskier assets as well as from some money market mutual funds. To help stabilize short-term funding markets, we lengthened the term and lowered the rate on discount window loans to depository institutions. The Board also established, with the approval of the Treasury Department, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) under our emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Under the PDCF, the Federal Reserve provides loans against good collateral to primary dealers that are critical intermediaries in short-term funding markets. Similar to the large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS that I mentioned earlier, this facility helps restore normal market functioning.  In addition, under section 13(3) and together with the Treasury Department, we set up the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, or CPFF, and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or MMLF. Millions of Americans put their savings into these markets, and employers use them to secure short-term funding to meet payroll and support their operations. Both of these facilities have equity provided by the Treasury Department to protect the Federal Reserve from losses. After the announcement and implementation of these facilities, indicators of market functioning in commercial paper and other short-term funding markets improved substantially, and rapid outflows from prime and tax-exempt money market funds stopped.  In mid-March, offshore U.S. dollar funding markets also came under stress. In response, the Federal Reserve and several other central banks announced the expansion and enhancement of dollar liquidity swap lines. In addition, the Federal Reserve introduced a new temporary Treasury repurchase agreement facility for foreign monetary authorities. These actions helped stabilize global U.S. dollar funding markets, and they continue to support the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury and other financial markets as well as U.S. economic conditions.  As it became clear the pandemic would significantly disrupt economies around the world, markets for longer-term debt also faced strains. The cost of borrowing rose sharply for those issuing corporate bonds, municipal debt, and asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by consumer and small business loans. In effect, creditworthy households, businesses, and state and local governments were unable to borrow at reasonable rates and other terms, which would have further reduced economic activity. In addition, small and medium-sized businesses that traditionally rely on bank lending faced large increases in their funding needs as measures taken to contain the spread of the virus forced them to temporarily close or limit operations, substantially curtailing revenues.  To support the longer-term financing that is critical to economic activity, the Federal Reserve, in cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and using equity provided for that purpose under the CARES Act, announced a number of emergency lending facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. These facilities are designed to ensure that credit would flow to borrowers and thus support economic activity.  On March 23, the Board announced that it would support consumer and business lending by establishing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The TALF is authorized to extend up to $100 billion in loans and is backed by $10 billion in CARES Act equity. This facility lends against top-rated securities backed by auto loans, credit card loans, other consumer and business loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other assets. The TALF supports credit access by consumers and businesses and provides liquidity to the broader ABS market. The facility made its first loans on June 25, and, to date, has extended $252 million in loans to eligible borrowers. Since the TALF was announced, ABS spreads have contracted significantly. Thus, the facility might be used relatively little and mainly serve as a backstop, assuring lenders that they will have access to funding and giving them the confidence to make loans to households and businesses.  To support the credit needs of large employers, the Federal Reserve also established the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF). These facilities primarily purchase bonds issued by U.S. companies that were investment grade on March 22, 2020. The two facilities have a combined purchase capacity of up to $750 billion and are backed by $75 billion in CARES Act equity. Final terms and operational details on the PMCCF were announced on June 29, and it stands ready to purchase newly issued corporate bonds and syndicated loans, serving as a backstop for businesses seeking to refinance their existing credit or obtain new funding. The SMCCF buys outstanding corporate bonds and shares in corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to facilitate smooth functioning of the secondary market. The SMCCF complements the PMCCF, because improvements in secondary-market functioning associated with the SMCCF facilitate access by companies to bond and loan markets on reasonable terms. The SMCCF launched with ETF purchases on May 12. Earlier this month, the facility began gradually reducing purchases of ETFs as it started buying a broad and diversified portfolio of individual corporate bonds to more directly support smooth functioning and market liquidity in the secondary market. Purchase volumes are tied to market functioning and are currently at very low levels. The facility currently holds a total of about $10 billion in bonds and ETF shares.  Following the announcement of the two corporate credit facilities in late March, conditions in the corporate bond market improved significantly. Credit spreads on investment-grade bonds retraced much of the widening experienced in February and March, and issuance in the primary market rebounded strongly. In the secondary market, liquidity also improved, and by mid-April, flows out of mutual funds and ETFs specializing in corporate bonds reversed. 1  The Federal Reserve also launched the Main Street Lending Program, which is designed to provide loans to small and medium-sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the pandemic; such firms generally are dependent on bank lending for credit because they are too small to tap bond markets directly. Under the Main Street program, banks originate new loans or increase the size of existing loans to eligible businesses and sell loan participations to the Federal Reserve.

http://saharareporters.com/2020/06/29/order-nigerian-government-name-beneficiaries-covid-19-intervention-funds-serap-tells,"The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit asking the Federal High Court, Abuja, to order the Nigerian Government and Central Bank of Nigeria.to publish names of beneficiaries of cash transfers, food distribution and other reliefs during the lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic.

The suit followed SERAP’s Freedom of Information request dated April 4, 2020, expressing concern that, “Millions of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable people have not benefited from the announced palliatives, donations, reported cash payments, cash transfers and other reliefs.”

In the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/657/2020 filed by SERAP through its counsels, Kolawole Oluwadare and Joke Fekumo, and made available to journalists, the organisation sought, “An order for leave to apply for judicial review and an order of mandamus to compel Ms Sadia Umar-Farouk, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster.Management and Social Development, and Mr Godwin Emefiele, CBN governor, to publish spending details of public funds and private sector donations to provide socio-economic benefits to the country’s poorest and most vulnerable people.”

It also sought among others, “An order to direct and compel Ms Umar-Farouk and Mr Emefiele to publish an up-to-date list of donations and names of those who have made payments as per their publicly announced donations; spending details of the N500 billion COVID-19 intervention fund, and the names of beneficiaries, and whether such beneficiaries include people living with disabilities (PWDs).

“A declaration that the failure of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disasters Management and Social Development, and the CBN governor to provide SERAP with the requested information on spending details of public money and private donations and to publish names of beneficiaries amount to a fundamental violation of the FoI Act and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.”

The suit filed read in part, “By a combined reading of the FoI Act and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, Ms Umar-Farouk and Mr Emefiele ought to be directed and compelled to make public details of those that have benefited from COVID-19 funds and donations.

“Any perception that the reliefs, funds and donations are not reaching intended beneficiaries would undermine public trust and the integrity of the entire processes and modes of distribution of reliefs/benefits to these Nigerians.”

Alas, nothing could be further from the truth because the current economic sugar rush is almost entirely a function of the massive government spending spree, a spree which in just over a month will be effectively over. As a result, as Bank of America writes, the economy is facing fiscal cliffs which could cause the recovery to disintegrate, with four particular areas of focus:

expiration of extended unemployment insurance, the fading support from stimulus checks, exhaustion of PPP stress from state and local aid gov'ts.

In response, BofA expects another stimulus bill to be passed in late July to address some - but not all - of these concerns, and ""instead of a cliff, we will likely be facing a hill."" That may be optimistic, because any stimulus would need to be bipartisan, and if the Democrats wish to crush Trump's re-election chances, now is the time for them to push the economy into a depression with elections in just 4 months.

Will they do it? We'll know in a few weeks, and certainly once the July 31 benefits cliff hits.

Until then, here is BofA on the likely fiscal cliff outcomes:

Fiscal: look out below

In the face of the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal stimulus has poured into the economy. Washington has pushed in roughly $2.8tr of stimulus, equaling 13% of GDP while the Fed has expanded its balance sheet to $7.1tr. The rapid and forceful support on the policy front likely limited the downside during the recession and has helped to support the ongoing recovery. But we are now approaching a few ""cliffs"" which would prove painful if unaddressed. We see four areas of concern:

Unemployment insurance (UI): the incremental $600/week is set to expire on July 31st. To put some numbers around this, at the current level of nearly 20 million people receiving unemployment insurance this would equate to a reduction in personal income of $48bn ($576bn annualized) or 2.7% of GDP.

the incremental $600/week is set to expire on July 31st. To put some numbers around this, at the current level of nearly 20 million people receiving unemployment insurance Stimulus checks are no longer rolling in: the majority of the tax rebates / checks were distributed in mid/late April. To date, around $270bn of the $290bn has been pumped in. We find that consumers quickly spent the additional cash which means a diminishing support to spending.

We find that consumers quickly spent the additional cash which means a diminishing support to spending. Payroll Protection Program (PPP): of the $670bn allocated to the PPP, around 77% has been approved. The new legislation allows small businesses until the end of the year to allocate the funds (vs end of June previously) which prolongs the support from the program. However, the magnitude of the support is lessened given that the size of the program has not changed and it was initially designed to help small businesses get through a shock lasting roughly two months.

However, the magnitude of the support is lessened given that the size of the program has not changed and it was initially designed to help small businesses get through a shock lasting roughly two months. State & local aid: the CARES Act allocated $150bn to state & local governments to be used for unexpected coronavirus-related costs. But this did not address the revenue shock state and local governments have experienced. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), 29 states and DC expect FY 2021 general fund revenues to be lower than their pre-COVID projections. Without aid, these governments will be forced to make further cuts to employment and services.

Quantifying the impact

In Table 1, BofA groups the stimulus programs to date into major sectors. About 23% of the funds have been directed toward households to offset the significant strain on household incomes from massive job cuts. Moreover, if you include the required wage portion of the PPP loans, the household share of stimulus is over 40% of funds.

The good news is that these measures have worked. Personal income jumped 10.5% mom SA in April. An $879bn annualized decline in compensation was offset by a $2,999bn increase in transfer payments, of which $361bn was from unemployment insurance. Given that PPP was first getting underway in April BofA assumes it had little/no impact on labor income in April. If one nets out the boost from stimulus checks and unemployment insurance, personal income would have declined by 5.6% mom SA in April vs. the 10.5% reported increase.

In line with expectations, and the fading of a fiscal impulse, last Friday we observed a sizeable decline in personal income given that the boost from stimulus checks declined substantially compared to April. Looking ahead to June, BofA expects another drop in income as people shift back into the labor market from unemployment insurance. Given that the majority of those on unemployment insurance earned more from benefits than when they were working, the move back to employed will actually be a net negative for overall income. Indeed a recent paper (Ganong et al. 2020) found that roughly two-thirds of UI recipients are earning more than their lost wages.

The big question is what happens in August?

This will be the first month following the ""cliff"". The current law calls for the additional $600/week to expire. Based on BofA's forecast for the labor market, continuing claims in August could still be running around 16mn, up by nearly 15mn from the pre-COVID February levels. Assuming it is 16mn, the loss of the $600/week benefit would translate into roughly a $36bn drop in income in August, or a 2.3% mom decline.

The Payroll Protection Program (PPP) has also underpinned labor income. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved $516bn in PPP loans. Under previous rules, 75% of those funds had to go to payrolls over an 8 week period in order for the loan to be forgiven. As such, this would translate to $387bn in support for labor income, mostly in May and June. The law has since been amended such that businesses only need to use 60% of the funds for payroll costs over a 24 week period. However, no changes were made to the maximum size of the loan, which is the lesser of $10mn or 2.5x 2019 average monthly payrolls. While the changes will help businesses stay afloat as they deal with reduced demand, it also means that the support for labor income has been substantially reduced and spread out.

From income to spending

Clearly there has been a significant boost to personal income from stimulus. But now it is time to consider how this filters into the real economy via consumer spending. The biggest jolt to spending likely came from the stimulus checks. A paper from the Chicago Fed (Karger et al. 2020) found that in the two weeks after households received their stimulus check, they spent roughly 48% of it. Then spending fell back to normal levels. Based on analysis with aggregated BAC card data, the bank similarly found that the bulk of the incremental spending from the stimulus checks occurred over a 5-day period following receipt of the money.

Meanwhile, the path of consumer spending will be impacted by the trajectory for unemployment insurance. A paper from Ganong found that spending on nondurables declined by less than 1% while people were receiving UI, but at exhaustion dropped by 12%. Not extending the program would mean a 2.3% decline in personal income in August. Given the high propensity to consume out of unemployment insurance this would be a similarly sized hit to consumer spending in August.

However, by extending the program, the unemployment rate is also likely to be stickier as people have an incentive to stay out of work. Indeed, a recent analysis from the CBO found that if the program was extended as is through the end of the year then 5 out of 6 recipients would earn more on unemployment than they would if they were to return to work. They estimate that while this may boost GDP this year it would be a drag on growth next year. If the program was instead allowed to expire, presumably the unemployment rate would fall faster and more people would return to work. However, even with greater engagement in the labor market, income would still decline given that unemployment insurance is more generous and many workers will find challenges returning to the workforce.

The state and local stress

In addition to the impending ""cliff"" for household income, many state and local governments are facing a concerning revenue outlook as they move closer to the start of FY 2021. According to CBPP (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities), initial estimates of the revenue impact from the COVID-shock indicate that state revenue could drop in FY 2021 by more than it did during the Great Recession. States will be forced to tap into their rainy day funds first before ultimately making cuts to spending to offset the revenue shortfalls, as they are required to balance their budgets. Indeed, governors in Ohio, New Jersey and Georgia have already asked state agencies to prepare for sizeable cuts to spending. Indeed state & local government have already started to cut jobs - in the April and May employment report, state and local governments shed nearly 1.6mn workers.

Congress to take action in late July/early August

Republicans and Democrats are at odds over whether to extend the expanded unemployment insurance program for obvious reasons. The Democrats in Congress generally advocate for a full extension as was passed in the HEROES Act but Republicans are resisting, arguing that the generosity of the program has discouraged a return to work. A middle ground may be a smaller dollar amount (perhaps $250-300/ week) with back-to-work bonuses that will create an incentive to return to the workforce.

On state & local aid, the HEROES Act called for close to $1tr in relief. While this number is unlikely in our view, a bipartisan bill proposed by Senator Cassidy (R-LA) and Senator Menendez (R-NJ) proposed in May would allocate $500bn in aid to state and local governments. The ultimate number will likely be nearer to that number than the amount from the HEROES act.

There has also been some talk of another round of stimulus checks with President Trump affirming ""Yeah, we are"" [going to do another stimulus check], and White House Economic advisor Larry Kudlow saying that a second round would likely happen but be more targeted. While this also showed up in the Dem's HEROES Act, some Republicans in the Senate (Sen. Toomey (R-PA) and Sen. Cornyn (R-TX)) have voiced opposition to another round recently. Republicans have generally raised concerns that stimulus checks are not the most efficient way to target those who are most in need.

The White House has also been calling for other measures such as a payroll tax cut and an infrastructure package, although neither of these are likely as the payroll tax cut would only help those who still have a job while an infrastructure bill is unlikely to be tackled until after the election.

In summary, after July 31 the US economy is set to fly off a fiscal cliff that could be just as painful as what happened in late March/April unless there is a bipartisan agreement in Congress on trillions more in fiscal stimulus. The clock is now ticking.","       Skip to main content              Sort by  Relevance Newest Oldest   ZeroHedge Search            Login    Home    Contributors    Newsletter    Store    Manifesto    RSS    Donate    Channels - New!

A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been identified in China by scientists.

It emerged recently and is carried by pigs, but can infect humans, they say.

The researchers are concerned that it could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person, and trigger a global outbreak.

While it is not an immediate problem, they say, it has ""all the hallmarks"" of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring.

As it's new, people could have little or no immunity to the virus.

The scientists write in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swiftly implemented.

Pandemic threat

A bad new strain of influenza is among the top disease threats that experts are watching for, even as the world attempts to bring to an end the current coronavirus pandemic.

The last pandemic flu the world encountered - the swine flu outbreak of 2009 - was less deadly than initially feared, largely because many older people had some immunity to it, probably because of its similarity to other flu viruses that had circulated years before.

That virus, called A/H1N1pdm09, is now covered by the annual flu vaccine to make sure people are protected.

The new flu strain that has been identified in China is similar to 2009 swine flu, but with some new changes.

So far, it hasn't posed a big threat, but Prof Kin-Chow Chang and colleagues who have been studying it, say it is one to keep an eye on.

How worried should we be?

The virus, which the researchers call G4 EA H1N1, can grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airways.

They found evidence of recent infection in people who worked in abattoirs and the swine industry in China when they looked at data from 2011 to 2018.

Current flu vaccines do not appear to protect against it, although they could be adapted to do so if needed.

Prof Kin-Chow Chang, who works at Nottingham University in the UK, told the BBC: ""Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses.""

While this new virus is not an immediate problem, he says: ""We should not ignore it.""

In theory, a flu pandemic could occur at any time, but they are still rare events. Pandemics happen if a new strain emerges that can easily spread from person to person.

Although flu viruses are constantly changing - which is why the flu vaccine also needs to change regularly to keep up - they do not usually go pandemic.

Prof James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the work ""comes as a salutary reminder"" that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of pathogens, and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses.

A World Health Organization spokeswoman said: ""Eurasian avian-like swine influenza virus are known to be circulating in the swine population in Asia and to be able to infect humans sporadically.

It emerged recently and is carried by pigs, but can infect humans, they say. The researchers are concerned that it could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person, and trigger a global outbreak. While it is not an immediate problem, they say, it has ""all the hallmarks"" of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring. As it's new, people could have little or no immunity to the virus.     The scientists write in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swiftly implemented.

The last pandemic flu the world encountered - the swine flu outbreak of 2009 - was less deadly than initially feared, largely because many older people had some immunity to it, probably because of its similarity to other flu viruses that had circulated years before.  Coronavirus: This is not the last pandemic  Does the UK have coronavirus under control?  Worst could be 'yet to come' in coronavirus pandemic  That virus, called A/H1N1pdm09, is now covered by the annual flu vaccine to make sure people are protected. The new flu strain that has been identified in China is similar to 2009 swine flu, but with some new changes.

How worried should we be? The virus, which the researchers call G4 EA H1N1, can grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airways. They found evidence of recent infection in people who worked in abattoirs and the swine industry in China when they looked at data from 2011 to 2018. Current flu vaccines do not appear to protect against it, although they could be adapted to do so if needed. Prof Kin-Chow Chang, who works at Nottingham University in the UK, told the BBC: ""Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses."" While this new virus is not an immediate problem, he says: ""We should not ignore it."" In theory, a flu pandemic could occur at any time, but they are still rare events. Pandemics happen if a new strain emerges that can easily spread from person to person. Although flu viruses are constantly changing - which is why the flu vaccine also needs to change regularly to keep up - they do not usually go pandemic. Prof James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the work ""comes as a salutary reminder"" that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of pathogens, and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses. A World Health Organization spokeswoman said: ""Eurasian avian-like swine influenza virus are known to be circulating in the swine population in Asia and to be able to infect humans sporadically. Twice a year during the influenza vaccine composition meetings, all information on the viruses is reviewed and the need for new candidate vaccine viruses is discussed.

https://www.inverse.com/science/scientists-identify-a-swine-flu-virus-with-pandemic-potential,"In a new study, researchers identify an emergent swine flu virus spreading through China. They claim it has pandemic potential.

The discovery calls for immediate animal and public health precautions and control measures to prevent spillover and a disease outbreak in humans, the study argues.

In light of the widespread devastation wreaked by Covid-19, the idea of another pandemic virus sweeping the globe so soon may sound terrifying. But zoonotic disease experts, who study diseases that transmit between animals and humans, say it’s too early for panic. While it's important to respond to this threat, it is nowhere near the level of Covid-19.

""Right now there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission so we don’t have another human epidemic on our hands,"" Melinda Rostal, a veterinarian epidemiologist and zoonotic disease expert at EcoHealth Alliance, tells Inverse. Rostal was not involved in the study.

""But they have provided strong evidence through their transmission studies in human cells and ferrets that suggest if human-to-human transmission does start to occur easily we could be facing another large epidemic,"" Rostal adds. ""We need to be aware of this risk so that we can start taking measures to prevent spillover now, while it is still in pigs.""

G4 EA H1N1 — The study, published Monday in the journal PNAS, is the result of seven years of data collection, livestock surveys, animal testing, human sampling, and subsequent analysis.

The swine flu virus it identifies, G4 EA H1N1, is a recently emerged viral genotype of swine flu that is circulating in China. The study team writes that it poses a serious threat to human health, adding:

“Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in the swine industry, should be urgently implemented.""

Taken together, these results suggest that the new swine flu virus could spread quickly in humans and potentially cause a pandemic. Importantly, that possibility has not become a reality yet.

""It is important for people to know and remember that influenza viruses do continue to have the potential cause a pandemic, even as we continue the fight against the coronavirus pandemic,"" Rostal says. ""The results of this study should be acted upon by veterinarians and public health officials in Asia and we should be aware of it.""

Pigs and pandemics — Pigs are susceptible to catching and spreading influenza A viruses from birds, humans, and other pigs. This susceptibility means the animals are a key intermediate host, or ""mixing vessel,"" in the development of pandemic influenza viruses.

If a pig is infected with two or more types of viruses at the same time, such as human influenza and swine influenza, the viruses can swap genes in a process called reassortment, Rostal explains. Sometimes this leads to a new strain that can infect people because people do not have immunity to it and there's no vaccine.

The H1N1 “swine flu” virus that caused a pandemic in 2009 involved a virus that had genes from human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. The reassortment occurred in pigs.

""Zoonotic disease experts have been concerned about this type of gene swapping in pigs for some time now - even before the 2009 pandemic,"" Rostal explains.

Virus-hunting — To track potentially infectious swine flu viruses, between 2011 and 2018, the team collected 29,918 nasal swab samples from pigs in slaughterhouses across 10 provinces in China.

They also took 1,016 nasal swabs or lung samples from pigs showing respiratory symptoms at a veterinary teaching hospital. Forty-three of these pigs were positive for influenza virus.

Overall, the researchers isolated 179 swine flu viruses. Of these viruses, 165 were described as Eurasian Avian-like Influenza A (EA H1N1). This indicated that EA H1N1 is the predominant subtype virus circulating in pig populations in China, the team reports. They analyzed the viruses' genetic makeup and found that genotype 4 (G4) was dominant.

European avian influenza viruses have been circulating since 2001, but according to this analysis, G4 EA H1N1 — the newly identified virus — has been dominant in China since 2016.

To test how G4 EA H1N1 influences the body, the team introduced the virus to human cells and ferrets.

In turn, they found that it exhibits some of the features of the 2001 H1N1 swine flu virus, which sickened over 60,000 million people: It efficiently binds to SAα2,6Gal receptors, replicates efficiently in human airway epithelial cells, and shows high infection and transmissibility in ferrets.

A potential threat — After surveying 300 workers on 15 pig farms, the team also found that 10.4 percent of their blood samples contained antibodies against G4 EA H1N1.

""G4 EA H1N1 viruses possess all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,"" the scientists write. ""Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring of swine working populations should be promptly implemented.""

To date, there have been five human cases of illness linked to this type of virus, the team reports. Two of the patients infected with the virus had neighbors who reared pigs, suggesting that the G4 EA H1N1 virus can transmit from swine to human.

""It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,"" the team writes.

Based on these findings, scientists should work to strengthen farms in the region's biosecurity, Rostal says.

""While the threat is not imminent, it is important that people working in the pig value chain — such as farmers or sellers — take measures to prevent further transmission of the virus from pigs to people,"" she says.

Other precautionary measures could include preventing wildlife from coming into contact with these pigs, restricting what people can be in contact with the pigs, and not purchasing and adding new pigs to herds, Rostal says. Veterinary health officials should also start working on a vaccine for use in the pigs to prevent the spread of this particular genotype of the virus, she explains.

For now, it's hard to measure this strain's pandemic potential before there are cases of human-to-human transmission documented, Rostal says. In the meantime, she argues this finding highlights the need to support zoonotic disease monitoring.

""Our health is intricately linked with the health of domestic and wild animals and the environment,"" Rostal says. ""We need to support and trust the scientists that are working hard to track the potential for spillover and pandemics and the veterinary and public health specialists that are working to monitor and prevent these diseases from causing epidemics in people and in animals.""

Abstract: Pigs are considered as important hosts or “mixing vessels” for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses. Systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs is essential for early warning and preparedness for the next potential pandemic. Here, we report on an influenza virus surveillance of pigs from 2011 to 2018 in China, and identify a recently emerged genotype 4 (G4) reassortant Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 virus, which bears 2009 pandemic (pdm/09) and triple-reassortant (TR)-derived internal genes and has been predominant in swine populations since 2016. Similar to pdm/09 virus, G4 viruses bind to human-type receptors, produce much higher progeny virus in human airway epithelial cells, and show efficient infectivity and aerosol transmission in ferrets. Moreover, low antigenic cross-reactivity of human influenza vaccine strains with G4 reassortant EA H1N1 virus indicates that preexisting population immunity does not provide protection against G4 viruses. Further serological surveillance among occupational exposure population showed that 10.4% (35/338) of swine workers were positive for G4 EA H1N1 virus, especially for participants 18 y to 35 y old, who had 20.5% (9/44) seropositive rates, indicating that the predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity. Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses.","Outbreak Scientists identify a swine flu virus with pandemic potential ""We need to be aware of this risk so that we can start taking measures to prevent spillover now, while it is still in pigs.""

https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/505042-who-director-pandemic-speeding-up,"Six months after the World Health Organization (WHO) first identified a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases at a hospital in Wuhan, China, the number of people newly infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is rising rapidly.

More than 10 million people across the globe have tested positive for the coronavirus, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday, nearly 180,000 of whom tested positive in the last 24 hours.

Almost half a million people have died worldwide.

""The reality is this is not close to being over,"" Tedros told reporters. ""Globally, the pandemic is actually speeding up.""

About half the cases, and nearly half the deaths across the globe, have come in the Americas. The United States, which accounts for about 4 percent of the global population, has nearly a quarter of the total confirmed cases, 2.4 million.

States reported more than 44,000 new cases on Sunday, the WHO said in their daily situation report on Monday, higher than any nation on earth. Brazil reported 46,000 new infections on Saturday, and almost 39,000 new infections on Sunday.

Russia and India have both reported more than half a million cases, while the United Kingdom, Peru and Chile have each reported more than a quarter million cases.

The actual number of people who have been infected with the coronavirus is probably multiples higher than the numbers reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said last week that samples taken from blood tests in the United States show as many as 25 million Americans might already have been infected, ten times the number of confirmed cases.

But Tedros cautioned that even with such prevalent spread, billions of people are still at risk of infection.

""This virus still has a lot of room to move,"" he said. ""The virus is spreading aggressively.""

Tedros said the WHO would dispatch a team to Wuhan next week to investigate the potential animal source of the new coronavirus. The initial cluster of cases has been linked to a food market in the city, which serves as a major manufacturing and transportation hub, though the exact source of the initial infections is unknown.

He said the virus can still be contained and that robust contact tracing methods must be employed to identify and isolate those who are infected so they do not spread it further. He pointed to contact tracing work done in volatile eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an Ebola outbreak has formally ended after nearly two years.

If contact tracing can work in a war zone, he said, it can work in nations at peace, no matter the scope and scale of the outbreaks.

""For many of our countries to really not hunt down this virus is our failure in contact tracing, because we have lame excuses, saying it's too many and it's too difficult to trace,"" Tedros said. ""Trust me, there is not too many even in a world situation. If contact tracing helps you to win the fight, you do it, even risking your life.""","                                                        Skip to main content         sign up for newsletters  Home  News Senate  House  Campaign  Administration  Business  Regulation  Media  Briefing Room  State Watch  Latino  Polls  12:30 Report  Coronavirus Report  Politics 101  Floor Action  In The Know  Sunday Talk Shows   Policy Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security   Regulation Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security   Opinion Contributors  Columnists  Become a contributor  Congress Blog   Hill.TV  Video Campaign  Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security  Sunday Shows  Events  Lawmaker Interviews   Podcasts HillCast  HistoryCast   Print Edition  Events Upcoming Events  Past Events  About   People  Campaign    Follow Us  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn    TheHill.com © 1996-2020 News Communication Terms & Conditions  Privacy Policy                Top menu  News Senate  House  Administration  Campaign  Business  Regulation  Media  Briefing Room  State Watch  Latino  Polls  12:30 Report  Coronavirus Report  Politics 101  Floor Action  In The Know  Sunday Talk Shows   Policy Defense  Energy & Environment  Finance  Healthcare  Technology  Transportation  International  Cybersecurity  National Security   Opinion Columnists  Congress Blog   All Contributors  - Campaign  - Civil Rights  - Criminal Justice  - Education  - Energy & Environment  - Finance  - Healthcare  - Immigration  - International  - Judiciary  - Technology  - White House  - Become A Contributor    Events Upcoming Events  About   Jobs  HILL.TV  Changing America Respect  Sustainability  Enrichment  Resilience  Well-Being   Coronavirus Report       Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn     Search form   Search                 TRENDING:  Coronavirus  russian bounties  Donald Trump  Joe Biden                      WHO director: Pandemic 'speeding up'   By Reid Wilson - 06/29/20 01:14 PM EDT                                                         Six months after the World Health Organization (WHO) first identified a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases at a hospital in Wuhan, China, the number of people newly infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is rising rapidly.

Brazil reported 46,000 new infections on Saturday, and almost 39,000 new infections on Sunday. Russia and India have both reported more than half a million cases, while the United Kingdom, Peru and Chile have each reported more than a quarter million cases. The actual number of people who have been infected with the coronavirus is probably multiples higher than the numbers reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said last week that samples taken from blood tests in the United States show as many as 25 million Americans might already have been infected, ten times the number of confirmed cases. But Tedros cautioned that even with such prevalent spread, billions of people are still at risk of infection. ADVERTISEMENT ""This virus still has a lot of room to move,"" he said. ""The virus is spreading aggressively."" Tedros said the WHO would dispatch a team to Wuhan next week to investigate the potential animal source of the new coronavirus. The initial cluster of cases has been linked to a food market in the city, which serves as a major manufacturing and transportation hub, though the exact source of the initial infections is unknown. He said the virus can still be contained and that robust contact tracing methods must be employed to identify and isolate those who are infected so they do not spread it further. He pointed to contact tracing work done in volatile eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an Ebola outbreak has formally ended after nearly two years. If contact tracing can work in a war zone, he said, it can work in nations at peace, no matter the scope and scale of the outbreaks. ""For many of our countries to really not hunt down this virus is our failure in contact tracing, because we have lame excuses, saying it's too many and it's too difficult to trace,"" Tedros said. ""Trust me, there is not too many even in a world situation. If contact tracing helps you to win the fight, you do it, even risking your life.""

As Covid-19 devastated older Americans this spring, often by racing through nursing homes, the deadly outbreaks compounded the devastation of Alzheimer’s and other forms of degenerative brain disorders that are common among elderly residents in long-term care facilities.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-06-29/how-forecast-outbreaks-and-pandemics,"In 1900, the deadliest hurricane in U.S. history hit Galveston, Texas. The storm, estimated to have been a Category 4, all but washed the city away. An estimated 8,000 people died, and even more lives would likely have been lost if Isaac Cline, the chief of the Texas section of the U.S. Weather Service, had not spent the day before the hurricane’s arrival walking around and urging people to seek higher ground. He did so on little more than a hunch based on the fact that a bad storm had recently passed over Cuba. The science of weather forecasting had yet to emerge; guesswork was the best anyone could do.

Over a century later, hurricane forecasts are a central feature of summer and fall for millions of Americans. Such forecasts, along with those predicting winter storms, tornadoes, and floods, have saved an untold number of lives and many billions of dollars. Even fair-weather forecasts play an important role in modern life. Take the airline industry, for example. “Even when you’ve got clear skies, that has an economic benefit,” explained Greg Romano of the National Weather Service, “because then you don’t necessarily need to plan to reroute as much, so you can perhaps take on less fuel; you know that you can have tighter schedules.”

With the world moving quickly toward an age of pandemics, the story of how weather forecasting in the United States improved deserves attention. Because when it comes to modeling the likely course of contagious outbreaks, the country is in some ways closer to the bad old days of deadly, no-notice hurricanes than to the current era of precision storm tracking and multiday weather forecasts.

Today, if a hurricane was barreling down on Florida, no one would suggest that an arbitrary assortment of academics gather data, quickly develop models to predict the storm’s course, anticipate its landfall, tell agencies where to preposition response teams, and craft warnings for the public. That, however, is essentially what the U.S. government has done during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of course, sophisticated disease modeling has contributed a great deal to the response to the pandemic. Early in the outbreak, modelers estimated that the new coronavirus would prove more deadly than influenza. Others concluded that rapid containment of the virus in China was unlikely, based on the unusually high number of infected international travelers. And when the United States was in the throes of the worst outbreak in the world, it was modelers whose work informed the White House task force that coordinated the federal response, including the decision to begin (and later extend) the “Slow the Spread” campaign of social-distancing measures and business closures.

Unfortunately, however, the full force of epidemiological expertise in the United States is not being brought to bear. Despite some successes, serious gaps remain in the ability of infectious disease models to inform public health policy. That is because the country has no centralized system for disease forecasting; there exists no epidemiological equivalent of the National Weather Service. That is precisely what the country needs to succeed in the fight against COVID-19 and to avoid future failures and missteps of the sort that has marred the U.S. response to the current pandemic.

MODEL CITIZENS

This is hardly the first time that academics have filled the disease-modeling vacuum. In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, officials in Pennsylvania consulted modelers as they deliberated about whether to shut down schools. During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, modelers helped the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services calculate the risk that travelers would import cases into the United States, how many hospital beds would be needed domestically, and how many future cases could be expected under varying scenarios.

But after those outbreaks ended, the ad hoc and informal ties that had developed between modelers and decision-makers were not institutionalized; no formal system emerged for centralizing expertise within the government. So it should have been no surprise that the few modeling experts who do this work within government agencies were quickly overwhelmed by the enormous number of consequential decisions demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. And once again, academic modelers have stepped in to fill the gap.

This is part of a familiar pattern. During contagion crises, modeling becomes a priority. However, as the sense of urgency fades, attention shifts to other issues and relationships between experts and decision-makers fade. The chief danger is that as the results of modeling shift, those changes won’t get on the radar of policymakers. “The projections provide information at a particular moment but unfortunately will change all the time. It’s important to communicate that uncertainty,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. Shaman’s research has been consulted by the White House task force on COVID-19, but Shaman says that the working relationship has been limited.

During contagion crises, modeling becomes a priority. However, as the sense of urgency fades, attention shifts to other issues.

The CDC’s epidemiology task force has convened weekly meetings with pandemic experts. These meetings are a marked improvement in coordination and information exchange over such efforts in previous outbreaks. However, the connection to key decision-makers, including the White House task force, has not been clear.

One result has been a proliferation of models without enough people to make sense of them. “It’s really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, without someone or a group of people evaluating the assumptions and form of each model,” said Shaman. “There are a lot of teams who want to contribute to modeling efforts, but we don’t have a clear game plan for separating and combining the various projections.”

CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF PANDEMIC

To better integrate disease forecasting into decision-making, the CDC and other public health agencies should look to the history of the National Weather Service for inspiration. Americans take for granted the elaborate, highly detailed weather information they can easily access. But such tools developed only after decades of sustained public investment.

Numerical weather forecasting emerged in the 1920s in the wake of mathematical advances that helped describe atmospheric physics. Decades later, computers allowed meteorologists to apply more elaborate models. Other new technologies—aircraft, weather balloons, satellites, and digital communications—made it possible for scientists to add ever more data to the models, creating a virtuous cycle that led to progressive improvements in forecasting over time.

But technological change is only part of the story; the other part involves organizational change. During the Civil War era, tracking and anticipating weather was a largely academic effort. Later, disparate independent efforts emerged in multiple federal agencies, including the Department of War, the Department of Agriculture, and the Navy. Finally, in the late 1960s, what would eventually become the National Weather Service was established as an integrated office in the Department of Commerce. This unification and centralization was crucial: it allowed for significant investment over time and created a stable point of contact between forecasters and policymakers by giving weather experts a permanent seat at the table.

NUMBERS GAME

Outbreak modeling and analytics should be centralized in a similar way. Over the last decade or so, public investments in disease forecasting have yielded some progress. Programs funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Homeland Security have advanced modeling capabilities, generated excellent research, and helped to develop a cadre of well-trained experts.

These programs, however, are largely focused on developing basic science, as opposed to helping public health officials navigate difficult decisions about outbreak control. And they rarely receive the kind of reliable, sustained funding that has long supported weather forecasting. Generally, funding takes the form of grants to principal investigators that typically last only three to five years and must result in academic publications—the kind of research that is necessary but not sufficient to the task at hand.

“Everyone is on grants,” noted Cécile Viboud, a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health. “So if you don’t have a particular dedicated line of funding to work on the [outbreak], then you do it on your own time. You just run those estimates because maybe it can help.”

Making matters worse, private-sector innovation and advanced data technologies have hardly made an appearance when it comes to contagion modeling, in part because there is usually not a great deal of market demand, public health agencies are ill-equipped to evaluate new data technologies, and new technologies must pass through a torturous regulatory path before gaining approval.

Health data are fragmented across the U.S. health-care system in silos that cannot talk to one another.

Roni Rosenfeld, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, pointed out another problem. “By far the biggest obstacle is the data,” he lamented. Health data are fragmented across the U.S. health-care system in silos that cannot talk to one another. And public health agencies are not known for being forward leaning on data technology. This hampers their ability to acquire, process, share, analyze, and communicate data that would inform an outbreak response.

“There is no systematic report format for individual locations to provide data in,” said Lauren Gardner, an engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the team that built the university’s coronavirus map, which has become one of the most reliable sources of data on the spread of COVID-19. “Even when data is provided, it may not be in a usable format. Together these issues substantially limit the capabilities of disease models to be able to inform policy in real time.”

Unfortunately, the pandemic is laying bare these data challenges. The White House task force announced last month that all 4,700 or so hospitals in the United States would be asked to send daily emails to the task force with data on their capacities. It’s baffling that in the country that sparked the digital revolution, hospitals must rely on such a rudimentary, unreliable tool in order to transmit vital information.

It’s also striking that the most timely and detailed data on new cases of COVID-19, diagnostic testing, and personal protective equipment have been available mostly through websites set up and run by volunteers or journalists. It is wonderful that so many skilled individuals have been motivated to help out in a time of crisis. But the country’s pandemic response cannot rely on volunteers. And although journalism is crucial during an outbreak, responsibility for tracking the spread of contagions can hardly be outsourced to media organizations.

HOW TO MOVE FORWARD

The best way to address these vulnerabilities would be the establishment of a National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Analytics (CEFA). The center would handle research and development in outbreak science, develop technology for producing disease forecasts, and provide guidance for preparedness and response to outbreaks. The center’s structure should resemble that of the National Weather Center, located at the University of Oklahoma. The NWC has a unique structure that enables academics to work closely with federal employees and develop a mutual understanding of respective challenges and capabilities. In the same manner, the new center would work with the CDC, nonprofit organizations such as the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, public health departments in all 50 states, and the National Governors Association to improve outbreak science and analytics, decision-making during outbreaks, and the data and technologies needed to support these efforts.

During an epidemic outbreak, CEFA scientists could help to forecast how many cases might emerge in a given place during a given period, which interventions would be most effective, and where to direct resources, and would assess progress in the fight against the pathogen.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, each jurisdiction has been on its own when it comes to finding modelers to help make those kinds of determinations. Sadly, those jurisdictions without access to world-class modelers or epidemiologists were left out in the cold. CEFA would change that by providing all governors and mayors access to high-level insights.

The pandemic is a stark reminder that Americans are vulnerable to the forces of nature.

Between outbreaks, CEFA scientists would develop new models and advance the science of forecasting and analyzing outbreaks, just as atmospheric scientists work constantly to improve the accuracy of weather models. Initially, the center would focus on improving the predictive analytics needed to produce forecasts of new cases and deaths. It would also work to improve visualizations and communication approaches to make as clear as possible the implications and uncertainties involved in all modeling.

To be successful, CEFA scientists would need the ability to directly advise decision-makers on preparedness and response, as forecasters do in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies brings together experts in various fields, including epidemiology and modeling, to advise the government. The United Kingdom has not always managed to successfully bring scientific expertise to bear on emergencies, but the fact that it has a formalized way of bringing experts together puts it in a better position than the United States. Other countries have similar mechanisms. In the Netherlands, for example, the Infectious Diseases Modelling team at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment is chaired by Jacco Wallinga, an esteemed modeling expert who also holds a prominent academic position.

In addition to working with officials, just as local meteorologists translate the complex weather models into forecasts that are easily understood by the public, CEFA science communicators could bring forecasts and analyses to the public to help individual decision-making. Just as people rely on weather reports to know when to bring an umbrella, CEFA forecasts could make it easier to decide whether to telework during flu season or whether to wear a face covering. People want to know how to keep themselves and their families safe, and providing information to help them do so would be an enormous advance for public health.

To meet its mission, the center would need to be able to identify, adapt, and adopt cutting-edge technology and attract the best data scientists, engineers, and technologists. That would require significant, sustained funding: approximately $1 billion over the next ten years. But it would be money well spent.

The COVID-19 pandemic should serve as the epidemiological equivalent of the Galveston hurricane. It is a stark reminder that Americans are vulnerable to the forces of nature. But as with weather forecasting, with sufficient vision and investment, the United States can develop the ability to anticipate and respond to such outbreaks. The country can do better—and it must do better, so that this never happens again.","   Skip to main content           ×  Close dialog              Email            No, thanks                                                         Current Issue   July/August 2020             Cart   Sign in  Subscribe                      Search          Sign in  Cart   Subscribe       Magazine    Current Issue  See Full Archive  Subscribe      Regions     Africa   Congo  Sudan  Somalia  South Africa  Browse All Africa     Americas   Brazil  Canada  Cuba  Mexico  United States  Venezuela  Browse All Americas     Asia   Afghanistan  China  India  Japan  North Korea  South Korea  Browse All Asia     Europe   France  Germany  Norway  Turkey  United Kingdom  Browse All Europe     Middle East   Egypt  Iran  Iraq  Israel  Saudi Arabia  Syria  Browse All Middle East     Russia & FSU   Russia  Ukraine  Browse All Russia & FSU    World      Topics    Politics & Society  Environment  Security  Law & Institutions  Economics  U.S. Foreign Policy      Collections    Anthologies  Reading Lists  This Day In History      Book Reviews    Capsule Reviews  Review Essays  Browse All Reviews      More    Articles with Audio  Interviews  Ask the Experts  Newsletters  Events          Search     Sign in  Subscribe                 How to Forecast Outbreaks and Pandemics  America Needs the Contagion Equivalent of the National Weather Service  By Caitlin Rivers and Dylan George June 29, 2020            Sign in and save to read later       Save to Pocket           Share     Print this article            Save     Share on Twitter         Share on Facebook     Send by email      Get a link               A Health and Human Services staff member shows a coronavirus outbreak map in Washington, D.C., February 2020  Carlos Barria / Reuters     In 1900, the deadliest hurricane in U.S. history hit Galveston, Texas.

The country can do better—and it must do better, so that this never happens again.  Loading... Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-musicians-are-fighting-for-streaming-pay-during-the-pandemic/,"Indie rockers Stolen Jars are not exactly Coldplay or U2, but they’re not a garage band either. They tour regularly and have been covered by NPR and The New York Times. They have a fanbase. They’ve placed one of their off-kilter songs in an iPad commercial. They currently have more than 22,000 monthly listeners on Spotify. Bandleader Cody Fitzgerald estimates he makes about $1,500 to $2,000 every year from streaming services, which is good for about a month’s rent on his New York apartment.

That annual streaming income, Fitzgerald is quick to note, is quite high for bands of Stolen Jars’ stature. “Most people are on labels, which means they get, at most, 50 percent of that,” he says. Fitzgerald self-releases Stolen Jars’ albums. He is also the band’s primary songwriter and performs many of the instruments on the recordings himself, all of which entitles him to an unusually large share of the total payments from services like Spotify and Apple Music.

Musicians with different label and publishing situations—even those whose music is more popular—may make significantly less. Tasmin Little, a celebrated classical violinist based in the UK, has received honors including a Classic BRIT award and an Order of the British Empire designation from Queen Elizabeth. She has more than 600,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, and her recordings are featured on popular playlists like Classical Essentials, which has 1.9 million followers. Little tweeted last month that she was recently paid £12.34, or around $15.50, for six months of streaming on Spotify, a period in which she would have had over 3.5 million total streams, according to her current statistics.

When the coronavirus pandemic shut down the possibility of touring for the foreseeable future, cash-strapped musicians lost their most reliable way to make money. Revenue from streaming has always been small for many indie musicians, but now it is one of the few income sources available, along with sales of merch, physical records, and downloads on Bandcamp—a platform that has proven to be vastly more profitable for many indie musicians compared to large streaming services. According to artists, the pandemic is only exacerbating the inequities of a system that is rigged against the people who make it run. Under these dire circumstances, musicians are organizing through unions and other advocacy groups to fight for larger payments from streaming platforms.

One such group is the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW), a new organization that counts Fitzgerald as a member of its steering committee, alongside members of bands like Speedy Ortiz and Downtown Boys. Another is the Keep Music Alive alliance, a partnership between the UK’s Musicians Union and songwriters association the Ivors Academy, which joined forces after the pandemic’s onset, aiming to remedy the “woefully insufficient” payments made from streaming services, according to a mission statement. These organizations differ in approach, location, and scale—the Musicians’ Union was formed in the 19th century and represents 30,000 people; UMAW was formed in May and its current membership numbers in the hundreds—but both are responding to the same crisis.

“I don’t have any friends who don’t have some kind of financial worries right now,” says Sadie Dupuis, UMAW founding member and guitarist-songwriter of Speedy Ortiz. “For most musicians I know who are touring full-time, the work they have outside of that is all based in the service industry, and they can’t get back into that either.” According to Mark Taylor, communications director of the Ivors Academy, the situation represents nothing less than an existential crisis over the future of music itself. “We really just want to keep music alive,” he says. “It’s good for us, it’s good for our souls, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for culture.”","Skip to main content Open Navigation Menu To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then  View saved stories .

The UMAW, as a new organization aimed at a host of issues including streaming, has not yet formalized a set of demands for changes. Both groups acknowledge that the process of fixing streaming will be as complicated as the recognition of its brokenness is simple. How do streaming payments work? Artists receive, on average, a small fraction of a cent for each time one of their songs is streamed on a major platform. A seemingly obvious fix would be for the platforms to simply increase this number. But while these tiny per-stream payments are a useful concept for identifying the problem, they’re not particularly useful for solving it, because they don’t reflect the mechanism by which the platforms actually distribute money. According to a detailed survey of streaming payments by the music industry analytics company Soundcharts, streaming platforms pay out roughly 60 to 70 percent of their annual revenue to “rightsholders,” a group that includes musicians, record labels, songwriters, publishers—anyone who has a financial stake in the sales of a given record. Spotify, the most popular platform in the U.S. and globally, projected a total revenue between roughly $9 and $9.5 billion for 2020 in a recent letter to shareholders , which would make the total rightsholders’ take something like $6 billion for this year. That huge pile of money is then divvied up to artists (and their associated labels and so on) according to their stream counts as a fraction of the total streams on the platform for a given period. A single stream does not entitle a musician to a payment of some fixed amount; it entitles them to a slightly larger piece of the total rightsholders’ pie. To understand why per-stream payments can be an unrepresentative metric, imagine no one streamed anything on Spotify for all of 2020, except for a single person who played, say, 100 gecs’ “Money Machine” a single time. As long as those hypothetical non-listeners didn’t cancel their subscriptions, and money kept rolling in to Spotify, that one play could earn 100 gecs millions of dollars, because it would entitle them to the whole pie. Soundcharts offers another way of looking at it. Each time Spotify introduces a new feature aimed at keeping people listening for longer, like autoplaying similar artists after you finish an album, it sends the average per-stream figure down. That’s not because Spotify is suddenly skimping on payments, but because people are streaming more songs—and when people stream more songs, a single stream is equivalent to a smaller pie slice. That’s fine for established artists whose music is regularly recommended by these listener-retention features, because the dilution in value of a single stream is offset by an increase in streams. But for artists who aren’t being recommended, it means their streams are worth less. How could platforms make payments bigger? Though making streaming services work better for musicians is not as straightforward as demanding a higher payment per stream, there are several ways the system could theoretically be changed to get more money into artists’ pockets. Most obviously, companies like Spotify could increase the 60 to 70 percent share of their revenue that they pay out to rightsholders. But if recent history is any indication, that number is likely to go down before it goes up. Spotify renegotiated its deals with labels in 2017; before that, the payout number was more like 80 percent . At the time, the labels agreed to have their payments cut—thereby reducing musicians’ payments as well—because they believed they needed Spotify in order to ensure their own survival. With streaming accounting for an ever-increasing majority share of the recording industry’s revenue each year, the labels probably won’t be changing their minds about that anytime soon. Advertisement But even if Spotify and the labels reverted back to the old deals, it doesn’t seem like it would do much for the average musician; it’s not as though indie bands were rolling in dough from streaming back in 2015. Groups advocating for bigger streaming payments could demand that Spotify give up an even larger revenue share—90 percent, say—but it’s hard to imagine Spotify would agree to it. Even the labels, who would have to sign off on such a deal and would be its chief beneficiaries, seem more inclined to accept Spotify’s word that they’re better off making less money so that Spotify can thrive. Another option would be to advocate for the platforms to increase their subscription price. Higher monthly fees means more revenue; more revenue increases the size of the overall pie given out to rightsholders; a bigger pie means bigger slices for all musicians. But while most music fans likely agree that artists deserve more money, asking listeners to pay up themselves is trickier. “It’s interesting, the price of a subscription has stayed static for a number of years,” says Taylor of the Keep Music Alive alliance. “But frankly, given where we are economically right now, and pressure on peoples’ wallets, that’s probably not the route to go down as a campaign.” Instead, Keep Music Alive advocates for overhauling the payment system entirely, toward what’s known as a user-centric model , which would apportion the subscription fee from each user to the artists they actually listened to that month. If I only listen to 100 gecs, my $9.99—minus Spotify’s take—goes directly to 100 gecs and their label. The current system, known as pro rata, gives more financial weight to the preferences of users who stream more songs, whereas user-centric payments would treat the preferences of all users equally. Taylor says the user-centric model is a better reflection of how listeners interact with the artists they love outside of the streaming realm: “We choose to go to gigs, to buy merchandise, and part of that exchange is, ‘I want my money to go to this artist, so they can make a living, and do more of what they do.’ That is a very distinct relationship that currently doesn’t work, really, in streaming.” A user-centric model is appealing in the abstract, and there is reason to believe it could financially benefit some smaller artists in the long run. According to a 2017 study by the Finnish Music Publishers Association, 10 percent of all streaming revenue flows to the top .4 percent of artists under the pro rata system. The study found that a user-centric system would cut the revenue to that top tier nearly in half and increase the overall flow of money to less popular artists. However, some individual small artists ended up receiving less money under a user-centric system in the study’s simulation. The French streaming platform Deezer announced a switch to user-centric payments last year, but for now there is little real-world data showing its effects one way or the other. What about labels? Streaming platforms do not make payments directly to musicians, but rather to labels, distributors, publishers, and copyright collection societies, all of whom take their own cuts before passing the money along. The share of revenue that ends up in a performing artist’s pocket also depends on factors that have more to do with these other parties than the streaming services themselves: chiefly, whether the artists are performing their own compositions or someone else’s, and the size of the splits they’ve negotiated with their label over revenue from their recordings. These factors may help explain why a songwriter with no label like Stolen Jars’ Cody Fitzgerald makes more money from streaming than a signed artist who mostly performs works by other composers like Tasmin Little, despite the greater popularity of Little’s recordings. Advertisement The label’s cut of an artist’s streaming revenue varies from artist to artist and label to label, and the contracts that govern it aren’t generally made public. But several experts  estimate that labels get anywhere from 50 to 85 percent. Fifty-fifty splits are common to indie labels; majors generally take a larger share. The Keep Music Alive campaign broadly presents itself as a critique of the streaming industry, but its specific platform focuses equally on the role of labels. According to Taylor, the 85 percent a major label might take from an artist’s revenue is no longer justified in the streaming era. “A lot of that is a hangup from when they had larger overheads, from when they had to store and ship CDs,” he says. “There was a cost to all of that, which is now largely being reduced. We’re basing this new system on outdated models.” What’s next? For musicians facing an undeniably appealing and increasingly dominant technology that threatens to usurp their livelihood, resistance can seem futile. It would be foolish to pretend that streaming isn’t an amazing service from a listener’s perspective, or that it will go away just because it doesn’t seem fair. Talk to enough musicians and you’ll find plenty who are vocal critics of streaming, but still host their albums on streaming services and are subscribers themselves. “It would be great to strike a new balance, because these streaming services are really helpful in terms of music discovery—I buy more records than I used to, because I can get psyched up on something new without having to go to the listening station at the Virgin Megastore,” says Dupuis. “But the discrepancy between what mega-corporations are pulling in off artists’ music and what we’re pulling in is pretty gross.” An individual musician who’s inclined to protest that discrepancy has limited options. They could pull their catalog from the platforms, but that seems doomed to fail as anything other than an act of symbolism.“Unless there’s a big collective action to do that, that will not do anything,” Fitzgerald says. “If you do it by yourself, it will just make it so you can’t grow your fanbase, so you can’t be a band.” Spotify’s problems with paying musicians may be inextricable from its value proposition to subscribers: $9.99 per month is an incredibly small price to pay for push-button access to nearly the entire history of recorded music. Practically every musician on Earth is vying for their piece of the pie, and there just may not be enough to go around. Spotify understandably wants to make money, and probably deserves something for its development of the technology itself. But even if it conceded to pay 100 percent of its revenue to rightsholders, and somehow managed to continue operating, the payouts under the current system would still be paltry for many musicians. Take Tasmin Little’s $15.50 for six months of streaming. Multiply that by 10—a factor which would far exceed Spotify’s total revenue if it were applied to its entire catalog—and it’s still only $155. Recognizing the futility of the situation doesn’t inure musicians to its indignities, which have continued rolling in as the pandemic pause stretches into an epoch of its own. First, there was the virtual “ tip jar ” that Spotify rolled out as an optional add-on to artist pages, which allowed listeners to donate money to musicians directly—an apparently well-intentioned gesture that nonetheless served as a tacit admission that streaming revenue could never keep most artists afloat on its own, even as Spotify subscriptions and revenue surged during the early weeks of the outbreak. Advertisement Then, there was the news that Spotify had paid the wildly popular podcaster Joe Rogan over $100 million for exclusive rights to his show, the latest indicator of a larger priority shift toward podcasts for the company. Ted Gioia, a music historian and jazz pianist, summed up musicians’ frustrations with a tweet : “A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they’re paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights… In other words, Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world. Sound fair to you?” I emailed Gioia, who has written a celebrated book on music’s power to subvert existing orders, to ask if there’s any way that musicians, and the listeners who love them, can change the streaming system for the better. In a thoughtful and lengthy response, he chastised the record industry for failing to keep up with technological innovations on its own, allowing tech companies like Spotify to swoop in and set the negotiating terms. He pointed out that individual musicians have little to no leverage in their dealings with streaming platforms, despite the fact that their music makes those platforms run. He called the prospect of convincing platforms to pay musicians more a “pipe dream.” Despite all this, he ended his message with a faint note of hope. One way to fix things, he wrote, “would involve musicians taking control of their own destiny,” and walking away from streaming en masse to start something new. “Make no mistake, musicians could run their own streaming and distribution platforms, and reallocate the cash toward the people who create the songs,” he continued. “No, I don’t expect any of these things to happen. I’m just saying they could happen.” Tags Industry News The most trusted voice in music More From Pitchfork Video Artists Lists & Guides Podcast Masthead Events Pitchfork Music Festival Chicago Pitchfork Music Festival Paris Pitchfork Music Festival Berlin Pitchfork Midwinter All Events Newsletter RSS Feeds Contact Accessibility Help Advertising Condé Nast Spotlight © 2020 Condé Nast.

Sanctions on benefits will return on Tuesday after a three-month freeze, as lockdown easing sees job centres open.

In March, the government said people on benefits and Universal Credit would not be penalised for 90 days if they failed to look for work, due to coronavirus.

Labour has called for an extension to the ban, saying there is an ""unemployment crisis looming"".

But Work and Pension Secretary Therese Coffey said the return of ""claimant commitment"" rules was ""essential"".

Over 5.2m people claimed Universal Credit in May, compared to just over 2m in May 2019 - although some of the rise may be covered by the phased roll-out of the system and they will not all be jobseekers.

The government had paused the requirement for claimants to actively look for work, or make themselves available to work.

Face-to-face appointments in job centres were also halted, as well as reviews and reassessments for a number of benefits, including Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payments (PIP).

During questions in the Commons, shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds said the plan to re-introduce sanctions - which could lead to benefit cuts for some - came at a time when ""unemployment has risen sharply"".

""Where vacancies have dropped, when people are shielding and the schools haven't yet gone back, threatening people with reducing their support if they don't look for jobs is surely untenable"", he said.

He called on Ms Coffey to announced an ""an immediate extension"".

But the minister said: ""It is important that as the job centres fully re-open this week that we do reinstate the need for having the claimant commitment and it is an essential part of the contract to help people start to reconsider what vacancies there may be.""

After the exchange, Mr Reynolds released a statement, saying the decision was ""incomprehensible"" and that job centres were ""lacking guidance"" on how to re-open safely.

He added: ""With the unemployment crisis looming, it is alarming that there is no thought being given on how to offer proper support to those seeking work at this time.

""We need a proper plan from the government to get Britain back to work - sanctions aren't the answer.""

A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said the government had ""been there for those who have lost jobs or have reduced hours in this pandemic, promptly processing new claims and getting money into the accounts of those in urgent need within days"".

But, he added: ""Now our focus is rightly switching to Getting Britain Back into Work. From July, people can make an appointment with their work coach if they can't get the help they want online or over the phone and work coaches will be calling all claimants to help them get ready for the world of work.""","        Homepage Accessibility links Skip to content Accessibility Help  BBC Account Notifications  Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Menu Search Search the BBC Search the BBC             News   BBC News Navigation     Sections           Home      UK      World      Business      Politics   selected     Tech      Science      Health      Family & Education      Entertainment & Arts      Stories      Video & Audio      In Pictures      Newsbeat      Reality Check      Special Reports      Explainers      The Reporters      Have Your Say      Disability        Politics  selected     Parliaments      Brexit                 UK Politics               UK Politics              Coronavirus: Benefit sanctions to return as job centres reopen       29 June 2020              Share this with Facebook           Share this with Messenger           Share this with Twitter           Share this with Email           Share this with Facebook           Share this with WhatsApp           Share this with Messenger           Share this with Twitter      Share    Share this with  These are external links and will open in a new window      Email  Share this with Email       Facebook  Share this with Facebook       Messenger  Share this with Messenger       Messenger  Share this with Messenger       Twitter  Share this with Twitter       Pinterest  Share this with Pinterest       WhatsApp  Share this with WhatsApp       LinkedIn  Share this with LinkedIn     Copy this link   https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-53223474   Read more about sharing.

https://gothamist.com/food/arthur-avenue-reopening-street-piazza?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=shared_twitter,"As Arthur Avenue settles into Phase 2 of reopening, the Bronx’s historic Little Italy has become something brand new: A piazza, complete with 100 tables set up on the sidewalks and into the street.

Peter Madonia, chair of the Belmont Business Improvement District and the owner of Madonia Bakery, said it’s a plan he’s excited about for its own sake, regardless of the pandemic.

“Even if everything went back to normal tomorrow, would people enjoy this? I think they would,” he said. “We’re expanding our own vision to something we never thought about before. In a crisis, there is sometimes opportunity, and there’s an opportunity to create a real piazza in the middle of the Bronx that never existed before.”

Though each restaurant on Arthur Avenue is ultimately in charge of its own reopening, Madonia worked with street design expert Sam “Gridlock Sam” Schwartz to come up with a schematic — which isn’t 100 percent final — for what the entire strip could look like. (See full schematic below.) According to the Bronx Times, ""the street closure will likely begin around Friday, July 10th as the Department of Transportation has already granted forms of temporary approval for the streetside al fresco dining plan.""

The basic idea: Three blocks of Arthur Avenue would be closed to most traffic on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights — plus Sunday afternoon and evening — with a 15-foot-wide space in the middle of the road for emergency vehicles and pedestrians. About two dozen dining establishments would be allowed to stick four-person tables into the street, so long as they’re six feet apart and separated from traffic by some kind of barrier. And sidewalks would need ramps to ensure that people with accessibility challenges can get up and down.

Regina Delfino, the owner of Mario’s restaurant, said she has considered getting six concrete barriers “like the ones you see on the highway” to place around her in-street tables.

“I went to Westchester and looked at what they’re doing, and I saw all these concrete barriers and they had painted them white,” said Delfino. “Once you paint them and put some flowers on each side of them, they actually don’t look bad! Anything you can pick up and bring inside, that’s not going to protect your customers.” (As of last weekend, Mario’s had up highway-style barriers made of plastic.)

Beyond blocking off tables, the most important step for keeping both customers and restaurant staff safe is putting in place new sanitary precautions. Delflino, like multiple restaurant owners Gothamist spoke to, said she’ll require staff to wear masks, limit the number of people allowed in the kitchen, and set up multiple hand sanitizing stations. Then there’s the psychological component — do both staff and patrons feel comfortable returning to a restaurant, even if it’s outside?

“This past week has exceeded my expectations,” said Maria Di Rende, the owner of Enzo’s, which opened last Monday. In addition to 13 tables set up on the front sidewalk and in the street, she has six tables in a backyard patio that can be used during Phase 2.

“The customers are ecstatic we’re open — each day has been busier and busier,” Di Rende said. “It may not be normal as of yet, but it’s better than perfect.”

One thing that sets Arthur Avenue apart from other dining districts in New York City is that 80 percent of its patrons come from 10 to 40 miles outside the neighborhood, according to a Belmont BID marketing study. Many regulars live in parts of suburban New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that are further along in their reopenings, and local restaurateurs say that while health concerns kept people away prior to the shutdown, the Bronx’s relative lag has been tough for business.

“Right before that last day when we closed — March 16th — we had at least 120 reservations cancel along with two different bus tours,” said Ralph Napolitano, the co-owner of Ann & Tony’s. “So we’re talking almost $10,000 where we were being hit, right off the bat. We were like, God this is not going to be good going forward.”

But for the last several weeks, Napolitano said he’s been getting calls from his regulars in New Jersey who keep asking if he’s open yet.

“We have a core of customers who are going to come and say hello — even if they just pass by, get a cannoli or something,” he said.

There’s a catch to all this. A dream scenario for the restaurants on Arthur Avenue would be to have 400 people eating Italian food and enjoying each other’s company in the open air. What’s also true: A photo of 400 people eating Italian food and enjoying each other’s company is ripe for entering the “look at these schmucks” album of public shaming. (When diners are at their tables, they won’t be required to wear masks.)

The restaurant owners Gothamist spoke to weren’t too worried about it.

“In this society, in this climate we have now, of course there’s gonna be a backlash,” said Napolitano. “There’ll be one person sitting there, taking a picture and putting it on social media and saying, ‘look at these guys over here!’ That’s just the way we live.""

“One thing — we love families to come with little kids and grandparents and all, and sometimes the little kids get out hand,” he added. “So I’ll walk over very nicely and say, ‘I understand, but there’s other people here…’ So we’ll do it like that. If they’re standing up, roaming around without a mask, whatever it is, they can get fined also. So I already know my language on that: ‘I don’t want to see you get a fine, so stay in your chair.’”

Gina Delfino, the owner of Mario’s, isn’t bothered by people gathering, either.

“When they opened up Westchester, I went there and I was jealous!” she said. “There were so many people, and I wasn’t like, ‘Look at these dumb assholes,’ I was like, ‘Oh my God, why can’t we do this yet? It’s not fair! I want to do this.’”

Delfino, who’s father died of the coronavirus in early April, said it was a tough few months for herself and the family business, which her great-grandfather opened in 1919. Now, she’s extremely eager to get the restaurant on a path towards being fully operational again.

“All [the staff] was on unemployment, and I know unemployment was paying them very well,” she said. “They’re going to come back and make a quarter of what they were making on unemployment, I don’t know how happy they’re going to be. So if we don’t get the customers — you just hope that everybody comes back.”

“It’s not an accident to be in business for 100 years,” said Madonia. “You have to figure things out through a lot of stuff! Their passion is to get open again and serve their customers.

“My grandfather opened the bakery in 1918, right before the second wave of the Spanish Flu,” he continued. “He never closed — I don’t remember anyone in the family talking about it. They went through the Depression, went through World War II, went through a lot in this neighborhood. I use it for myself to get out of bed in the morning, to say, ‘How are we going to get through this uncharted territory?’ But then I realize, maybe it’s not that uncharted.”

Turner said in April and May the positivity rate was 3%, and it is now 13%. “We are experiencing a surge currently in the city of Houston. We cannot lose focus that our goal is to bring the number down to blunt the progression of this virus,” he said. Turner and public health officials said that doctors are seeing more cases among young people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Dr. David Pearse with the Houston Health Department said that 15% of the patients in intensive care units right now are in their 20s and 30s.

After testing nearly 1,200 inmates for Covid-19, 507 were positive and 472 were negative, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said. An additional 186 inmates were still awaiting results. The number of infections reported Monday was a significant increase from Thursday, when the sheriff’s office reported a total of 108 inmates had tested positive. Earlier this month, the approximately 1,200 inmates at the North Jail Annex were quarantined after 13 inmates who had transferred from the Fresno County jail to the Wasco State Prison tested positive for the coronavirus. At the time, the sheriff’s office called the cases “the largest spike in cases we have seen associated with our jail."" ""There will be no inmate movement within the North Jail until further notice,"" it added. The sheriff’s office said Monday that the 14-day quarantine period, which began on June 19, is now more than halfway over and there is still no movement within the North Jail. “This only occurs if someone there tests positive,” it said. We then move them to another area where they quarantine with other positive inmates.” 6:45 p.m. ET, June 29, 2020 Miami Beach mandates face masks in public spaces effective Tuesday From CNN's Denise Royal An aerial drone view as beachgoers take advantage of the opening of South Beach on June 10 in Miami Beach.

An additional executive order will continue to require social distancing, bans gatherings of more than 50 people unless there is six feet between each person, outlines mandatory criteria for businesses, and requires sheltering in place for those living in long-term care facilities and the medically fragile. The order also outlines that the State Board of Education must provide ""rules, regulations, and guidance for the operation of public elementary and secondary schools for local boards of education"" in accordance with guidance from Dr. Kathleen Toomey, the Department of Public Health, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. That order runs through 11:59 p.m. on July 15. ""While we continue to see a decreasing case fatality rate, expanded testing, and adequate hospital surge capacity, in recent days, Georgia has seen an increase in new cases reported and current hospitalizations,” Kemp said. “Together, we can win the fight against Covid-19 and emerge stronger,” he added. The latest numbers: On Monday afternoon, Georgia Department of Public Health confirmed 79,417 cases of Covid-19, 2,784 deaths, 10,824 hospitalizations, and 2,289 admissions into intensive care units in the state. 6:20 p.m. ET, June 29, 2020 Peru reports 2,946 new Covid-19 cases From CNN's Claudia Rebaza Peru reports 2,946 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, bringing the total to 282,365, according to data released by the country’s health ministry. Peru’s capital, Lima, continued to show the highest number of cases in the country with 157,050 people infected. The death toll has reached 9,504, with 187 new fatalities reported in the last 24 hours. On Sunday, the ministry’s data reported 181 new deaths.

https://reason.com/2020/06/29/reopen-schools-coronavirus-covid-19/,"At a recent meeting to discuss back-to-school procedures amid the ongoing pandemic, officials representing a school district in Wake County, North Carolina, detailed a complicated plan that would require bus drivers to administer temperature checks to students.

Any student who failed the check would be denied entry onto the bus, and a parent would be summoned to come get them. But bus drivers can't leave kids alone at bus stops, so the entire bus would have to stay put until the child was retrieved.

""Bus driver should remain on the bus to continue supervising other students on the bus, while also visually monitoring the student,"" declared the proposed guidance. ""Bus remains with the student until they have been picked up by their parent/guardian or until another transportation official arrives to supervise the student.""

It should be obvious that this plan—which is maximally disruptive for all students, parents, and employees involved—will never work. You can easily imagine kids spending all day on a bus, their restlessness and frustration mounting, as the driver waits in vain for an adult who either couldn't be reached or can't leave work.

As educators across the country begin to plan how classes will function in the fall, many proposals to make schools safer from the virus involve heavy degrees of unreality: children in masks throughout the day, classrooms half empty to accommodate social distancing, playgrounds closed, heavy reliance on virtual instruction, and so on. These precautions are largely unworkable—it's no more reasonable to expect children to wear masks and avoid interacting with each other all day than it is to make the bus wait hours if somebody fails a temperature check.

They are also at odds with the current scientific consensus about the coronavirus: that the risk to young people is minimal, and that they do not seem to spread the virus easily.

There is much that we don't know for certain about COVID-19. But the available evidence suggests that reopening schools as close to normal as possible is the most pragmatic approach. In Wired, David Zweig has presented a compelling case that the U.S. should follow Europe's lead and let students go back to school with minimal disruption:

Let's review some facts: Children are, by and large, spared the effects of the virus. According to the latest data from the CDC, infants, little kids, and teenagers together have accounted for roughly 5 percent of all confirmed cases, and 0.06 percent of all reported deaths. The Covid-linked child inflammatory syndrome that received fervent media attention last month, while scary, has even more infinitesimal numbers. ""Many serious childhood diseases are worse, both in possible outcomes and prevalence,"" said Charles Schleien, chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health in New York. Russell Viner, president of the UK's Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health, noted that the syndrome was not ""relevant"" to any discussion related to schools. There is also a wealth of evidence that children do not transmit the virus at the same rate as adults. While experts note that the precise transmission dynamics between children, or between children and adults, are ""not well understood""—and indeed, some argue that the best evidence on this question is that ""we do not have enough evidence""—many tend to think that the risk of contagion is diminished. Jonas F. Ludvigsson, a pediatrician and a professor of clinical epidemiology at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, reviewed the relevant research literature as of May 11 and concluded that, while it's ""highly likely"" children can transmit the virus causing Covid-19, they ""seldom cause outbreaks."" The World Health Organization's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, suggested last month that ""it does seem from what we know now that children are less capable of spreading"" the disease, and Kristine Macartney, director of Australia's National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, noted a lack of evidence that school-aged children are superspreaders in her country. A study in Ireland found ""no evidence of secondary transmission of Covid-19 from children attending school."" And Kári Stefánsson, a leading researcher in Iceland, told The New Yorker that out of some 56,000 residents who have been tested, ""there are only two examples where a child infected a parent. But there are lots of examples where parents infected children."" Similar conclusions were drawn in a study of families in the Netherlands.

This is hardly surprising, given that closing the schools in the first place does not appear to have been a sound strategy for containing the coronavirus. Studies in JAMA Pediatrics and The Lancet have found ample reason to doubt whether school closures saved a significant number of lives. As Mother Jones' Kevin Drum pointed out in a review of the scientific literature, closures ""have (a) little effect and (b) are probably nowhere near worth the tremendous impact they have on both parents and kids.""

That's an important point: Reducing the amount of time that children spend at school is terribly burdensome for many parents who rely on school's day care effect. Keep in mind that public schools are funded through taxes. It's hardly fair for the state to confiscate vast sums of money from its citizens, in part for the purpose of child care, and then suddenly cease offering this service while keeping the money. States that want to make it possible for people to return to work—for the economy to reopen—really need to prioritize schools: They are among the first elements of public life that must return to a semblance of normality, and the risks seem comparatively low.

It won't be possible to have a completely normal school year, of course. Officials should axe egregiously risky activities—no indoor pep rallies, for instance—and adult school employees might very well opt to wear masks or take other precautions, especially if they are elderly or immunocompromised. Wherever possible, district officials should make it possible for at-risk employees to work from home, or even to take the semester off. But they should not force kids to stay at home, clinging to the delusion that distance learning under these circumstances is anything other than an horrible burden on parents, and they should not force kids to hermetically seal themselves in bubbles when they do return to class.","                        Home Latest Magazine Current Issue Archives Subscribe Video Podcasts All Shows The Reason Roundtable The Reason Interview With Nick Gillespie The Soho Forum Debates Stossel Volokh Newsletters Donate Donate Online Ways To Give To Reason Foundation Torchbearer Society Planned Giving Subscribe Print/Digital Subscriptions Gift Subscriptions    Search for:       You are now logged in.

Protect the vulnerable, but let the kids go back to school. The damage done to children by denying them education will be catastrophic and most borne by the poor and the disenfranchised.

Log in to Reply  TJJ2000  June.30.2020 at 12:45 am You seem to infer people against “public education” are again education when really “public education” has very little to do with education. Problem #1 in public schools (illegitimate subjects take-over legitimate ones) … because knowing where the planets are, what the elements are and how to multiply certainly is what keeps each one of us alive and competent. If I’m going to eat; do you think I care if my gardener doesn’t know the mass of plutonium? If I’m going to build shelter; do you think I care if my carpenter knows where the planets are? “public education” focuses on stuff very few will ever need and SKIPS everything people DO need to learn. Problem #2 in public schools (Shockingly inefficient) Many one-day seminars will teach people just as much knowledge as a DECADE of public school “bookie” lock-down. Industrial education teaches inside reality and therefore has amazing effects of which “bookies” will never-ever realize even after a decade. There is no “book” that will replace real live experience. but “public education” will try for years on end to teach life experience education through a BOOK instead of spending 1-day in reality… Problem #3 the new useful idiot degree Politics that nobody but politicians and scam artists will ever use is taking up a good 50% of the subjects in public education. Heck one can study “female studies” for 20-years and still be the biggest idiot on the planet. That’s not “education”.

Log in to Reply  eyeroller  June.29.2020 at 10:23 am It’s hardly fair for the state to confiscate vast sums of money from its citizens, in part for the purpose of child care, and then suddenly cease offering this service while keeping the money. So they should give back the money. Actually, if you believe (as many people do) that public schooling can be actively harmful, then it’s better when they are closed, whether they keep the money or not.

Except that he starts with the CDC whose opinions are no more relevant than my dogs opinions. The stuff from Ireland, Australia, Iceland, even Sweden IS useful. It is still missing one huge bit of data which I’m stunned is still ‘missing’. Which is the current serological/antibody data for the under-20 crowd. Have they been exposed to the virus and developed antibodies – or have they NOT been exposed at the same rate as adults because schools were shut down everywhere early? Can’t even figure out the infection fatality rate for that age group if you don’t have that info. Nor can you follow that age group for a few months to see if there is some other longer-term issue re that virus and that particular age group beyond mere fatality – cuz you ain’t even following that group for basic antibody tests. I can’t fault any country for shutting down the K-6 schools at least in March. At that time, pretty much everything about this virus was in the realm of the unknown. Except for the generically known (kids are a freaking sewer for spreading germs) and a core universal societal value (a society that doesn’t have the impulse to protect its next generation deserves a societal Darwin award) I would hope that that same decision for September is based on what is now known. I have no confidence that will be the case for the US since afaics the US has learned nothing about the virus beyond what the DeRps have chosen to politicize about it and turn into a partisan electoral issue.

Hornberger Amidst the death and suffering arising from the coronavirus crisis, people have an opportunity to ponder some important questions about life and liberty. One question arises in the context of when state and local officials should force children back into school: Why should the state be involved in education at all? Since all of us are born and raised under the public schooling system, it’s difficult to imagine a different paradigm, one in which education and the state are separated. But throughout history, all great achievements in liberty have involved people thinking outside the box and adopting a new paradigm, especially when the old paradigm has proven to be defective.” https://www.fff.org/2020/05/22/how-about-permanently-closing-public-schools/ Willingly sending our children to Government Schools is a form of child abuse.

Simply one who never says, does or thinks anything that is unusual. Schools are maintained in order to bring this uniformity up to the highest possible point. A school is a hopper into which children are heaved while they are still young and tender; therein they are pressed into certain standard shapes and covered from head to heels with official rubber-stamps.” ~ H.L. Mencken “Governments have ever been known to hold a high hand over the education of the people. They know, better than anyone else, that their power is based almost entirely on the school. Hence, they monopolize it more and more.” ~ Francisco Ferrer “Wherever is found what is called a paternal government, there is found state education.

It has begun appearing in some younger children with Kawasaki Disease like symptoms, it is being called Multi System Inflammatory Syndrome. This is still the beginning of this pandemic, as this disaster progresses the virus will continue to change and in that process it will change us as a society and how we do things as well.

Dear UT Community,

Today, the university is releasing key elements of our plan for the fall semester, which will include online, hybrid and in-person learning options for students. Our goal is to create an environment that is as safe as possible for all community members, while reigniting the learning, teaching and research that make our university the world-changing place that it is.

Today’s plan provides a framework for the fall that is designed to accommodate the dynamic environment we’re facing and enable us to adapt to changes in the prevalence of COVID-19 in Austin and throughout Texas. And I know that things are changing every day.

Every person in our community has unique circumstances and concerns to contend with during this difficult time. Our faculty and staff members have stepped up to adapt courses and develop an innovative range of formats for teaching and learning, including adding additional online courses in recent weeks, and their efforts will continue throughout the summer. For students and families, we want you to have the ability to make informed choices about how you experience the fall semester, while keeping in mind that COVID-19 and its spread in Texas will continue to shape the exact ways we teach, learn, work and conduct research on and off campus. We are also reimagining student life activities, to hold them either fully or partially online or in outdoor spaces.

Below, you will find a summary of some of the significant policy decisions we have made for the fall. For an in-depth look at all of our fall planning decisions, please visit our new Protect Texas Together website, which provides specific guidance for students and families, faculty, staff and visitors and answers many frequently asked questions. This website will be updated continually throughout the summer and beyond, so please plan to refer back to it as time goes by.

Learning

The fall 2020 semester will start August 26. In-person instruction will end November 25, the day before Thanksgiving. Most students will remain away from campus for the remainder of the semester, taking final exams online from December 7 to 16.

Students may choose to experience the full fall semester online but should make sure to assess how this decision will affect their paths toward graduation.

Classes will be more evenly distributed throughout the day, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Rooms will be assigned to classes so that when all students registered for a given class attend in person, no more than 40% of seats in that classroom will be occupied.

There will be three modes of classes: Online — a class designed from the ground up so all students can attend the main class experience online. Hybrid — a class that has both in-person and remote learning elements, with the frequency of in-person learning based on instructional needs. Students may be able to take some hybrid courses on a completely remote basis, but other hybrid courses will require students to be on campus for a portion of their coursework. Specific frequency of in-person class meetings will vary by course and may be modified by departments in consultation with their deans during the semester as conditions change. The specific hybrid classes that can be taken completely online will be communicated to students in the coming weeks. In-person — a class for which there is at least some essential material that can be acquired only through in-person attendance.



In many in-person and hybrid classes, lectures will be streamed and/or recorded to allow students who become ill or who need to self-isolate to keep up and continue to make progress.

Online, hybrid and in-person courses will have the same tuition rates.

Every course will have an instructional continuity plan, including designating a teaching partner to take over the class in the event of instructor illness or emergency.

Health and Wellness

Wearing cloth masks at all times when inside university owned and controlled buildings will be mandatory except for:

When alone in a private office;

For students, when alone — or with a roommate — in an assigned dorm room;

When eating and drinking while practicing social distancing — including in a campus dining facility; and

When an alternative has been approved as part of the Americans with Disabilities Act or religious observance accommodation processes.

We encourage community members to wear cloth masks outdoors.

This summer, we will release a new app designed to help UT students, faculty and staff stay safe from COVID-19. The app will have a private diary function, allowing users to monitor symptoms and body temperature. It will also help users by providing information about available testing locations and processes.

UT has worked with public health officials to develop a strategy for testing symptomatic community members, as well as proactively testing community members based on predictive modeling. It is our expectation that UT testing labs could process up to 1,500 tests per day during the fall, barring any disruption to the supply chain.

University health professionals will work with Austin Public Health to conduct contact tracing for UT community members who test positive for COVID-19. Information voluntarily shared with contact tracers will follow public health privacy requirements.

Hand hygiene products and cleaning stations will be readily available across campus, and we encourage all members of the campus community to carry personal hand sanitizing products.

Residence Halls

All university-owned residence halls will open August 20 with a new process to safely move in. Residence halls will operate with social distancing measures and cloth mask requirements in place.

Students with a residence hall housing contract will receive an email by July 1 notifying them of the date they can access the housing portal to select a room. Students will be required to sign a COVID-19 amendment to their housing contract.

Most rooms in residence halls will be slated as double occupancy, with a limited number of single occupancy rooms.

Graduate student apartments will continue operating as usual, with social distancing measures and cloth mask requirements in place.

Faculty Members

Faculty members may choose to hold office hours on campus while adhering to campus safety and social distancing guidelines, or remotely (via Zoom or another technology solution).

Faculty members with medical conditions or other risk factors placing them at high risk for COVID-19 can request a reasonable accommodation using the Americans with Disabilities Act process. Those who already have an arrangement with their department chair to teach online do not need to go through this process. All others can request this accommodation using this form.

Faculty members who are assigned to teach in person but are concerned because they have a household member who is at high risk for COVID-19 may request flexible teaching arrangements using this form.

Faculty members who are unable to work due to COVID-19-related child care or school limitations should explore flexible work processes and review leave options available under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

Staff Members and Student Employees

Staff members who are able to work effectively from home will continue to do so into the fall with approval from their managers.

If an employee expresses personal concerns about a job that requires an on-campus presence, the university will use its existing flexible work processes to determine whether an alternate work arrangement is feasible.

If a return to campus concern involves a high-risk employee, the university will use our existing Americans with Disabilities Act process. Employees interested in requesting a reasonable accommodation should review the Employee Accommodation Request form.

Employees unable to work due to COVID-19-related child care or school limitations should explore flexible work processes and review leave options available under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

If you are a staff member participating in a voluntary or involuntary furlough program, please review these frequently asked questions.

Student employees will work with their supervisors to determine their working location and expectations, whether working in person, remote or hybrid.

We encourage supervisors and employees to work together to find solutions to address any current or future concerns that may arise.

International Travel Considerations

The university will follow the Centers for Disease Control recommendations and U.S. State Department guidelines regarding international travelers self-quarantining before returning to campus.

Given the likely delays for international students trying to enter the United States, graduate programs should be flexible about allowing international students to defer admission or start learning remotely, if they request it. Incoming foreign-resident non-citizens who expect to receive support for their services as TAs or GRAs should check with their departments about the availability of that support if they begin their studies from abroad.

Research

This summer, UT implemented a plan to reopen research activity across campus. Detailed information can be found in the Research Restart plan.

Athletics

The university is developing policies and procedures for hosting football games and other athletics events this fall pursuant to state, local and Big 12 Conference health and safety guidelines. UT expects to narrow the scenarios under consideration by the first week of August.

We are also implementing policies and procedures to return essential coaches, athletics staff and all student-athletes to campus in the fall for practice/competition pursuant to guidance by the CDC, state and local officials and athletics and campus medical staff.

For more information, please read the Athletics COVID-19 Policies and Procedures Manuals.

* * *

I want to thank the hundreds of faculty members, staff members and students who have worked very hard and gone above and beyond to create our plans and get us to this point. Our work isn’t done, but I am grateful for the tremendous effort that has been shown thus far from so many dedicated Longhorns.

To the entire UT community, I look forward to seeing many of you back on campus in the fall. For those of you who stay home and learn or work remotely, just know that you will be every bit as much a part of Longhorn Nation as you have always been.

And I’ll close by saying that for generations, our university has always rallied behind a simple saying — Texas Fight. And that’s exactly what we need to do right now.

Let’s fight through this difficult period together, and let’s Protect Texas Together.

Hook ‘em,

Jay Hartzell

Staff Members and Student Employees   Staff members who are able to work effectively from home will continue to do so into the fall with approval from their managers.    If an employee expresses personal concerns about a job that requires an on-campus presence, the university will use its existing flexible work processes to determine whether an alternate work arrangement is feasible.    If a return to campus concern involves a high-risk employee, the university will use our existing Americans with Disabilities Act process. Employees interested in requesting a reasonable accommodation should review the Employee Accommodation Request form .    Employees unable to work due to COVID-19-related child care or school limitations should explore flexible work processes and review leave options available under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act .    If you are a staff member participating in a voluntary or involuntary furlough program, please review these frequently asked questions .    Student employees will work with their supervisors to determine their working location and expectations, whether working in person, remote or hybrid.    We encourage supervisors and employees to work together to find solutions to address any current or future concerns that may arise.   International Travel Considerations   The university will follow the Centers for Disease Control recommendations and U.S. State Department guidelines regarding international travelers self-quarantining before returning to campus.    Given the likely delays for international students trying to enter the United States, graduate programs should be flexible about allowing international students to defer admission or start learning remotely, if they request it. Incoming foreign-resident non-citizens who expect to receive support for their services as TAs or GRAs should check with their departments about the availability of that support if they begin their studies from abroad.   Research   This summer, UT implemented a plan to reopen research activity across campus. Detailed information can be found in the Research Restart plan .   Athletics   The university is developing policies and procedures for hosting football games and other athletics events this fall pursuant to state, local and Big 12 Conference health and safety guidelines. UT expects to narrow the scenarios under consideration by the first week of August.    We are also implementing policies and procedures to return essential coaches, athletics staff and all student-athletes to campus in the fall for practice/competition pursuant to guidance by the CDC, state and local officials and athletics and campus medical staff.    For more information, please read the Athletics COVID-19 Policies and Procedures Manuals .   * * *  I want to thank the hundreds of faculty members, staff members and students who have worked very hard and gone above and beyond to create our plans and get us to this point. Our work isn’t done, but I am grateful for the tremendous effort that has been shown thus far from so many dedicated Longhorns.  To the entire UT community, I look forward to seeing many of you back on campus in the fall. For those of you who stay home and learn or work remotely, just know that you will be every bit as much a part of Longhorn Nation as you have always been.  And I’ll close by saying that for generations, our university has always rallied behind a simple saying — Texas Fight . And that’s exactly what we need to do right now.

https://www.indiewire.com/2020/06/amc-theatres-reopening-july-30-1234570343/,"With the summer movie season's flagship films ""Tenet"" and ""Mulan"" delayed yet again, AMC is shifting its reopening strategy.

The summer movie season, or what remains of it, is looking grim this month. AMC Theatres is now pushing its planned reopening date back by two weeks to July 30. The world’s largest movie exhibition chain was set to begin a phased set of re-openings across the country on July 15, but with the month’s flagship new releases “Tenet” and “Mulan” now shuffled to August 12 and August 21, respectively, there isn’t going to be enough new product to justify reopening any sooner amid a calendar as constantly shifting as it is dizzying.

At the moment, “Unhinged” starring Russell Crowe and from Solstice Studios is set to kick off the summer movie season on July 31. Don’t hold your breath. Another bit of summer escapist fare, “Broken Hearts Gallery” from Tri-Star and executive-produced by Selena Gomez, was also moved to August 7 on Monday.

According to AMC Theatres, the company expects some 450 of its 600 theaters to be reopened on July 30, and more or less fully operational by early August, in time for the summer’s slim offerings. The struggling chain, which has been hit with well over $2 billion in losses and has been shut down since mid-March, stirred much ado earlier in June when it announced that patrons weren’t required to wear masks in states not mandating face coverings. AMC quickly reversed course given the online response, but also the rising numbers of COVID-19 in the United States. Social distancing at AMC venues will be enforced through the use of directional signs and reminders.

It’s not necessarily good news. Exhibitors are wary about theaters reopening for a variety of reasons, IndieWire’s Tom Brueggemann reports. That includes not only the issue of masks and property distancing in theaters, but also the fragility of the theatrical window at a moment where virtually every studio is pushing its titles to VOD.

There’s also the issue that theaters could close again, too. New York officials have said that even in phase four, theaters still won’t be able to reopen. Los Angeles was given the green-light in early June to reopen on June 12, but the city abruptly put a pin in that, leaving theaters that had planned to open doors hanging.

https://gothamist.com/food/nyc-really-ready-phase-3-reopening,"Update: Just after 10 a.m. on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city and state will be reexamining the rules for indoor dining during Phase 3, given the issues we've seen in the rest of the country.

At 11:45 a.m., Governor Andrew Cuomo said during his briefing that a final decision on indoor dining would be made by this Wednesday, July 1st.

On Sunday, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered bars closed in several California counties, including Los Angeles. The decision comes just over two weeks after California reopened those establishments during Phase 3, which allowed bars and restaurants to open their indoor spaces to patrons again, albeit with limited capacity. Newsom's decision comes after California began to see an alarming spike in COVID-19 cases.

Prior to Newsom's order for bars to close, Florida and Texas closed their bars as well, following a surge in cases. In Michigan, 85 people contracted COVID-19 after visiting one bar; in Florida, 16 friends tested positive after a night out at one bar.

New York has seen a steady decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths, but now Phase 3 and the limited reopening of indoor public spaces is scheduled for next week, July 6th.

On Friday, Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked if he felt anxious seeing these spikes in other states that have reopened, and if he was worried that New Yorkers would get lax in adhering to policies that have slowed the spread in New York.

""I think a lot of the places that are having these horrible resurgences, they reopened very quickly, people really didn't necessarily understand or feel the full extent of the danger, and now, tragically, they're paying for it. We're the exact opposite,"" de Blasio said. ""We walked through hell and back. Overall, I think New Yorkers get that they have to participate if they want to keep things moving forward.""

And yet, here's what St. Marks Place looked like over the weekend (there are also photos from other areas over the past week above):

We are told that the Department of Transportation is performing ""proactive inspections"" after reports that social distancing and mask requirements were not being followed, and hope to educate establishments on their responsibilities if they are falling short. If restaurants are not operating safely, the city will suspend their curbside service license until they fix the problem.

The city has also promised more street space in July. In the meantime, some places with limited outdoor space have been getting creative:

Open-air protests, on the other hand, where a majority of attendees wear masks, have proven to be safe so far. Epidemiologist Stephen Morse told Gothamist, ""Outdoors is clearly safer, as we saw from the outcome of the recent Black Lives Matter marches — as of now, it seems there were few if any new cases resulting from those events.""

The hope is that Phase 2 outdoor dining has been safe as well, but since it only began one week ago, it's too early to tell if it's causing a spike. While establishments have been asked to keep 6 feet between tables, many have not been doing so; after months of full and partial closures, they are packing tables into their outdoor spaces. This could be problematic as patrons are largely unmasked and talking while seated, a known recipe for transmission.

Radegast Beer Hall in Williamsburg is one business that is trying to keep things in order during Phase 2, which is difficult at beer halls. ""What does happen sometimes is that a group will come in and ask us to move the tables closer together,"" manager Sean Snyder told Gothamist. ""We've always been home to large groups... That being said, once the party is gone, those tables are immediately spaced out again and disinfected."" Nodding to the Bourbon Street-esque scenes we've seen in the area, he added, ""We can't be held responsible for passers-by and are only responsible for the people in our seats.""

""The businesses that are opening are being really careful. I think we're good for Phase 3 as of today,"" de Blasio told WNYC's Brian Lehrer on Friday. ""But everything is based on the data. And if things start to go the wrong way, we're going to freeze really quickly. And if we even have to take a step back, we would. It’s just about watching it every day and communicating with people.""

On Sunday, we checked back in with de Blasio, and asked if New York City bars and restaurants will still be allowed to open indoor spaces on July 6th. Mitch Schwartz from the Mayor's Office told us, ""we’ll have more to say on that soon.""

Governor Andrew Cuomo's office did not respond to our request for comment. But on Monday, he told NY1, ""Malls and indoor dining are things that I’m concerned about and we may consider slowing them down for next week. Not going backwards, but we may actually slow them down.""","                       Menu      menu content begins                                                Donate     News    Arts & Entertainment    Food              Follow Us                                        Advertising    Contact Us    Newsletter    RSS Feed    Staff              Search this site           Search    Send a Story Idea                                                    View All Brands                © 2020 New York Public Radio.

https://www.today.ng/news/nigeria/asuu-suicidal-reopen-schools-304033,"



The Academic Staff Union of Universities on Monday kicked against the reopening of schools by the Federal Government amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The union argued that the government must make resources available in order for schools to meet proposed conditions by the Federal Ministry of Education.

ASUU National President, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, made this position known on Monday while speaking with newsmen in Ota, Ogun State.

He urged the government to provide the ideal environment and meet the conditions spelt out by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control before reopening schools across the country.

Ogunyemi said, “The Federal Government must lead and show the ways by meeting the conditions for reopening of schools before any school can be allowed to open because COVID-19 pandemic is a health challenge.





“When it comes to public health, it is something that should not be left in the hands of individuals but the Federal Government must take the lead.”

The ASUU president listed the conditions spelt out by NCDC to include the provision of materials for regular handwashing, provision of face masks, isolations spaces, hands sanitisers, amongst others.

He said many government-owned schools don’t have financial capacities to meet the outlined conditions.

He said, “It is suicidal to reopen schools now if the Federal Government itself could not meet the conditions spelt out by the NCDC and the World Health Organisation. The nation will expose innocent children to avoidable risks.”

Schools across the country were shut in March to curb the spread of the pandemic.",
https://www.fox4news.com/news/perot-museum-pauses-plan-to-reopen-in-july,"article

The Perot Museum of Nature and Science has decided not to reopen in early July as planned.

The museum announced it is pausing its reopening plans because of a spike in COVID-19 cases in Dallas County.

Other Downtown Dallas museums such as the Dallas Holocaust Museum, Dallas Museum of Art, Nasher Sculpture Center, Crow Museum of Asian Art and the Sixth Floor Museum will do the same.

“Though we have created rigorous guidelines and best practices to ensure that we reopen the museums safely and protect our staff and visitors, we are part of a larger community. We believe it is important to support Governor Abbott’s, Mayor Johnson’s and Judge Jenkins’ appeals for Texans to stay home, if at all possible, to be good community partners and neighbors.

Other Downtown Dallas museums such as the Dallas Holocaust Museum, Dallas Museum of Art, Nasher Sculpture Center, Crow Museum of Asian Art and the Sixth Floor Museum will do the same. “Though we have created rigorous guidelines and best practices to ensure that we reopen the museums safely and protect our staff and visitors, we are part of a larger community.

A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been identified in China by scientists.

It emerged recently and is carried by pigs, but can infect humans, they say.

The researchers are concerned that it could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person, and trigger a global outbreak.

While it is not an immediate problem, they say, it has ""all the hallmarks"" of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring.

As it's new, people could have little or no immunity to the virus.

The scientists write in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swiftly implemented.

Pandemic threat

A bad new strain of influenza is among the top disease threats that experts are watching for, even as the world attempts to bring to an end the current coronavirus pandemic.

The last pandemic flu the world encountered - the swine flu outbreak of 2009 - was less deadly than initially feared, largely because many older people had some immunity to it, probably because of its similarity to other flu viruses that had circulated years before.

That virus, called A/H1N1pdm09, is now covered by the annual flu vaccine to make sure people are protected.

The new flu strain that has been identified in China is similar to 2009 swine flu, but with some new changes.

So far, it hasn't posed a big threat, but Prof Kin-Chow Chang and colleagues who have been studying it, say it is one to keep an eye on.

How worried should we be?

The virus, which the researchers call G4 EA H1N1, can grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airways.

They found evidence of recent infection in people who worked in abattoirs and the swine industry in China when they looked at data from 2011 to 2018.

Current flu vaccines do not appear to protect against it, although they could be adapted to do so if needed.

Prof Kin-Chow Chang, who works at Nottingham University in the UK, told the BBC: ""Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses.""

While this new virus is not an immediate problem, he says: ""We should not ignore it.""

In theory, a flu pandemic could occur at any time, but they are still rare events. Pandemics happen if a new strain emerges that can easily spread from person to person.

Although flu viruses are constantly changing - which is why the flu vaccine also needs to change regularly to keep up - they do not usually go pandemic.

Prof James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the work ""comes as a salutary reminder"" that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of pathogens, and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses.

A World Health Organization spokeswoman said: ""Eurasian avian-like swine influenza virus are known to be circulating in the swine population in Asia and to be able to infect humans sporadically. Twice a year during the influenza vaccine composition meetings, all information on the viruses is reviewed and the need for new candidate vaccine viruses is discussed. We will carefully read the paper to understand what is new.

https://www.inverse.com/science/scientists-identify-a-swine-flu-virus-with-pandemic-potential,"In a new study, researchers identify an emergent swine flu virus spreading through China. They claim it has pandemic potential.

The discovery calls for immediate animal and public health precautions and control measures to prevent spillover and a disease outbreak in humans, the study argues.

In light of the widespread devastation wreaked by Covid-19, the idea of another pandemic virus sweeping the globe so soon may sound terrifying. But zoonotic disease experts, who study diseases that transmit between animals and humans, say it’s too early for panic. While it's important to respond to this threat, it is nowhere near the level of Covid-19.

""Right now there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission so we don’t have another human epidemic on our hands,"" Melinda Rostal, a veterinarian epidemiologist and zoonotic disease expert at EcoHealth Alliance, tells Inverse. Rostal was not involved in the study.

""But they have provided strong evidence through their transmission studies in human cells and ferrets that suggest if human-to-human transmission does start to occur easily we could be facing another large epidemic,"" Rostal adds. ""We need to be aware of this risk so that we can start taking measures to prevent spillover now, while it is still in pigs.""

G4 EA H1N1 — The study, published Monday in the journal PNAS, is the result of seven years of data collection, livestock surveys, animal testing, human sampling, and subsequent analysis.

The swine flu virus it identifies, G4 EA H1N1, is a recently emerged viral genotype of swine flu that is circulating in China. The study team writes that it poses a serious threat to human health, adding:

“Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in the swine industry, should be urgently implemented.""

Taken together, these results suggest that the new swine flu virus could spread quickly in humans and potentially cause a pandemic. Importantly, that possibility has not become a reality yet.

""It is important for people to know and remember that influenza viruses do continue to have the potential cause a pandemic, even as we continue the fight against the coronavirus pandemic,"" Rostal says. ""The results of this study should be acted upon by veterinarians and public health officials in Asia and we should be aware of it.""

Pigs and pandemics — Pigs are susceptible to catching and spreading influenza A viruses from birds, humans, and other pigs. This susceptibility means the animals are a key intermediate host, or ""mixing vessel,"" in the development of pandemic influenza viruses.

If a pig is infected with two or more types of viruses at the same time, such as human influenza and swine influenza, the viruses can swap genes in a process called reassortment, Rostal explains. Sometimes this leads to a new strain that can infect people because people do not have immunity to it and there's no vaccine.

The H1N1 “swine flu” virus that caused a pandemic in 2009 involved a virus that had genes from human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. The reassortment occurred in pigs.

""Zoonotic disease experts have been concerned about this type of gene swapping in pigs for some time now - even before the 2009 pandemic,"" Rostal explains.

Virus-hunting — To track potentially infectious swine flu viruses, between 2011 and 2018, the team collected 29,918 nasal swab samples from pigs in slaughterhouses across 10 provinces in China.

They also took 1,016 nasal swabs or lung samples from pigs showing respiratory symptoms at a veterinary teaching hospital. Forty-three of these pigs were positive for influenza virus.

Overall, the researchers isolated 179 swine flu viruses. Of these viruses, 165 were described as Eurasian Avian-like Influenza A (EA H1N1). This indicated that EA H1N1 is the predominant subtype virus circulating in pig populations in China, the team reports. They analyzed the viruses' genetic makeup and found that genotype 4 (G4) was dominant.

European avian influenza viruses have been circulating since 2001, but according to this analysis, G4 EA H1N1 — the newly identified virus — has been dominant in China since 2016.

To test how G4 EA H1N1 influences the body, the team introduced the virus to human cells and ferrets.

In turn, they found that it exhibits some of the features of the 2001 H1N1 swine flu virus, which sickened over 60,000 million people: It efficiently binds to SAα2,6Gal receptors, replicates efficiently in human airway epithelial cells, and shows high infection and transmissibility in ferrets.

A potential threat — After surveying 300 workers on 15 pig farms, the team also found that 10.4 percent of their blood samples contained antibodies against G4 EA H1N1.

""G4 EA H1N1 viruses possess all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,"" the scientists write. ""Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring of swine working populations should be promptly implemented.""

To date, there have been five human cases of illness linked to this type of virus, the team reports. Two of the patients infected with the virus had neighbors who reared pigs, suggesting that the G4 EA H1N1 virus can transmit from swine to human.

""It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,"" the team writes.

Based on these findings, scientists should work to strengthen farms in the region's biosecurity, Rostal says.

""While the threat is not imminent, it is important that people working in the pig value chain — such as farmers or sellers — take measures to prevent further transmission of the virus from pigs to people,"" she says.

Other precautionary measures could include preventing wildlife from coming into contact with these pigs, restricting what people can be in contact with the pigs, and not purchasing and adding new pigs to herds, Rostal says. Veterinary health officials should also start working on a vaccine for use in the pigs to prevent the spread of this particular genotype of the virus, she explains.

For now, it's hard to measure this strain's pandemic potential before there are cases of human-to-human transmission documented, Rostal says. In the meantime, she argues this finding highlights the need to support zoonotic disease monitoring.

""Our health is intricately linked with the health of domestic and wild animals and the environment,"" Rostal says. ""We need to support and trust the scientists that are working hard to track the potential for spillover and pandemics and the veterinary and public health specialists that are working to monitor and prevent these diseases from causing epidemics in people and in animals.""

Abstract: Pigs are considered as important hosts or “mixing vessels” for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses. Systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs is essential for early warning and preparedness for the next potential pandemic. Here, we report on an influenza virus surveillance of pigs from 2011 to 2018 in China, and identify a recently emerged genotype 4 (G4) reassortant Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 virus, which bears 2009 pandemic (pdm/09) and triple-reassortant (TR)-derived internal genes and has been predominant in swine populations since 2016. Similar to pdm/09 virus, G4 viruses bind to human-type receptors, produce much higher progeny virus in human airway epithelial cells, and show efficient infectivity and aerosol transmission in ferrets. Moreover, low antigenic cross-reactivity of human influenza vaccine strains with G4 reassortant EA H1N1 virus indicates that preexisting population immunity does not provide protection against G4 viruses. Further serological surveillance among occupational exposure population showed that 10.4% (35/338) of swine workers were positive for G4 EA H1N1 virus, especially for participants 18 y to 35 y old, who had 20.5% (9/44) seropositive rates, indicating that the predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity. Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses.","Outbreak Scientists identify a swine flu virus with pandemic potential ""We need to be aware of this risk so that we can start taking measures to prevent spillover now, while it is still in pigs.""

Further serological surveillance among occupational exposure population showed that 10.4% (35/338) of swine workers were positive for G4 EA H1N1 virus, especially for participants 18 y to 35 y old, who had 20.5% (9/44) seropositive rates, indicating that the predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity. Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses.

What the world doesn’t need now is a pandemic on top of a pandemic. So a new finding that pigs in China are more and more frequently becoming infected with a strain of influenza that has the potential to jump to humans has infectious disease researchers worldwide taking serious notice. Robert Webster, an influenza investigator who recently retired from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, says it’s a “guessing game” as to whether this strain will mutate to readily transmit between humans, which it has not done yet. “We just do not know a pandemic is going to occur until the damn thing occurs,” Webster says, noting that China has the largest pig population in the world. “Will this one do it? God knows.”

When multiple strains of influenza viruses infect the same pig, they can easily swap genes, a process known as “reassortment.” The new study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , focuses on an influenza virus dubbed G4. The virus is a unique blend of three lineages: one similar to strains found in European and Asian birds, the H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, and a North American H1N1 that has genes from avian, human, and pig influenza viruses.

The G4 variant is especially concerning because its core is an avian influenza virus—to which humans have no immunity—with bits of mammalian strains mixed in. “From the data presented, it appears that this is a swine influenza virus that is poised to emerge in humans,” says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who studies pathogens. “Clearly this situation needs to be monitored very closely.”

As part of a project to identify potential pandemic influenza strains, a team led by Liu Jinhua from the China Agricultural University (CAU) analyzed nearly 30,000 nasal swabs taken from pigs at slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces, and another 1000 swabs from pigs with respiratory symptoms seen at their school’s veterinary teaching hospital. The swabs, collected between 2011 and 2018, yielded 179 swine influenza viruses, the vast majority of which were G4 or one of five other G strains from the Eurasian avianlike lineage. “G4 virus has shown a sharp increase since 2016, and is the predominant genotype in circulation in pigs detected across at least 10 provinces,” they write.

Sun Honglei, the paper’s first author, says G4’s inclusion of genes from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic “may promote the virus adaptation” that leads to human-to-human transmission. Therefore, “It’s necessary to strengthen the surveillance” of pigs in China for influenza viruses, says Sun, also at CAU.

Influenza viruses frequently jump from pigs to humans, but most do not then transmit between humans. Two cases of G4 infections of humans have been documented and both were dead-end infections that did not transmit to other people. “The likelihood that this particular variant is going to cause a pandemic is low,” says Martha Nelson, an evolutionary biologist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center who studies pig influenza viruses in the United States and their spread to humans. But Nelson notes that no one knew about the pandemic H1N1 strain, which jumped from pigs to people, until the first human cases surfaced in 2009. “Influenza can surprise us,” Nelson says. “And there’s a risk that we neglect influenza and other threats at this time” of COVID-19.

The new study offers but a tiny glimpse into swine influenza strains in China, which has 500 million pigs. While Nelson thinks the predominance of G4 in their analysis is an interesting finding, she says it’s hard to know whether its spread is a growing problem, given the relatively small sample size. “You’re really not getting a good snapshot of what is dominant in pigs in China,” she adds, stressing the need for more sampling in the nation's pigs.

In the paper, Sun and colleagues—including George Gao, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention—describe lab dish studies that show how G4s have become adept at infecting and copying themselves in human airway epithelial cells. The viruses also readily infected and transmitted between ferrets, a popular animal model used to study human influenza. The researchers found antibodies to the G4 strain in 4.4% of 230 people studied in a household survey—and the rate more than doubled in swine workers.

In addition to stepping up surveillance, Sun says it makes sense to develop a vaccine against G4 for both pigs and humans. Webster says at the very least, the seed stock to make a human vaccine—variants of a strain that grow rapidly in the eggs used to make a flu vaccine—should be produced now. “Making the seed stock is not a big deal, and we should have it ready,” Webster says.

China rarely uses influenza vaccines in swine. Nelson says U.S. farms commonly do, but the vaccine has little effect because it’s often outdated and doesn’t match circulating strains.

Ideally, Nelson says, we would produce a human G4 vaccine and have it in the stockpile, but that’s an involved process that requires substantial funding. “We need to be vigilant about other infectious disease threats even as COVID is going on because viruses have no interest in whether we’re already having another pandemic,” Nelson says.","        Skip to main content                ScienceMag.org        Search    X     Advanced Search                  Contents       News       Careers       Journals                          Read our COVID-19 research and news.

https://davidicke.com/2020/06/30/flu-virus-with-pandemic-potential-found-in-china/,"A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been identified in China by scientists.

It emerged recently and is carried by pigs, but can infect humans, they say. The researchers are concerned that it could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person, and trigger a global outbreak.

While it is not an immediate problem, they say, it has “all the hallmarks” of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring. As it’s new, people could have little or no immunity to the virus.

The scientists write in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swiftly implemented.

Pandemic threat

A bad new strain of influenza is among the top disease threats that experts are watching for, even as the world attempts to bring to an end the current coronavirus pandemic.

The last pandemic flu the world encountered – the swine flu outbreak of 2009 that began in Mexico – was less deadly than initially feared, largely because many older people had some immunity to it, probably because of its similarity to other flu viruses that had circulated years before.

https://futurism.com/scientists-swine-flu-humans,"Scientists have discovered a new influenza virus in pigs, dubbed G4, that has the potential to be transmitted between humans.

The virus contains a blend of genetic material, Science reports, from several strains including the H1N1 strain from the 2009 pandemic that killed 12,000 Americans.

Humans have no immunity for the new virus, though it does not appear to have jumped to many humans yet, according to findings detailed in a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today.

“From the data presented, it appears that this is a swine influenza virus that is poised to emerge in humans,” Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who was not involved in the research, told Science. “Clearly this situation needs to be monitored very closely.”

The team analyzed almost 30,000 nasal swags taken from pigs at 10 different slaughterhouses in different Chinese provinces between 2011 and 2018. They discovered 179 swine influenza viruses, with the great majority being the G4 virus.

“G4 virus has shown a sharp increase since 2016, and is the predominant genotype in circulation in pigs detected across at least 10 provinces,” reads the paper.

They also note that the virus possesses “all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,” and should therefore be under strengthened surveillance.

Due to “increased human infectivity” rates, the opportunity for “virus adaptation in humans” is greatly enhanced, and therefore “raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses,” the scientists wrote.

Many influenza viruses actually have made the jump from pigs to humans, as Science points out, but most do not spread between humans. The researchers found five human cases of illnesses that were linked to this particular type of virus, two of whom had neighbors who raised pigs.

Experts are torn about whether the G4 virus will lead to the next pandemic. Martha Nelson, an evolutionary biologist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center, told Science that “the likelihood that this particular variant is going to cause a pandemic is low,” but noted that “influenza can surprise us.”

Nelson also pointed out that the sample wasn’t big enough to get a “good snapshot.”

“We need to be aware of this risk so that we can start taking measures to prevent spillover now, while it is still in pigs,” Melinda Rostal, a veterinarian epidemiologist and zoonotic disease expert at EcoHealth Alliance, told Inverse.

“It is important for people to know and remember that influenza viruses do continue to have the potential cause a pandemic, even as we continue the fight against the coronavirus pandemic,” Rostal added. “The results of this study should be acted upon by veterinarians and public health officials in Asia and we should be aware of it.”

“We just do not know a pandemic is going to occur until the damn thing occurs,” Robert Webster, a retired influenza investigator from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital told Science. “Will this one do it? God knows.”","/ Futurism / The Byte / Neoscope + Videos + Newsletter + Social Topics Search About / Futurism / The Byte / Neoscope + Videos + Newsletter + Social Topics Search About Submit Image via pxfuel/Victor Tangermann More Viruses Scientists Are Worried This New Swine Flu Strain Could Cause Another Pandemic ""We just do not know a pandemic is going to occur until the damn thing occurs.""

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/new-strain-of-flu-in-china-has-pandemic-potential-scientists-warns.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain,"Scientists have identified a new strain of flu carried by pigs in China that they say has the potential to become a pandemic.

The new strain is descended from the type of flu — known as ""swine flu"" — that emerged in 2009 causing the first global flu pandemic in 40 years.

The scientists published their peer-reviewed findings in U.S. science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday. They said the new strain of flu, which they called ""G4 EA H1N1,"" is a variation of swine flu, and includes the ""G4"" genotype that has become predominant in swine populations since 2016.

As with swine flu, the new strain has been identified as having ""all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus.""

The scientists, who studied flu viruses in pig populations between 2011 and 2018, noted that around 10% of swine industry workers they tested in China had already been exposed to the virus, which they described as ""of concern."" That rate increased among younger workers, aged 18-35, ""indicating that the predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity.""

""Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses,"" the scientists, who work at several Chinese universities and the country's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, noted.

They recommended close monitoring of swine populations — and anyone working with them.

""Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in swine industry, should be urgently implemented,"" they wrote.

""Pigs are intermediate hosts for the generation of pandemic influenza virus. Thus, systematic surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs is a key measure for prewarning the emergence of the next pandemic influenza.""

While ""swine flu,"" that first emerged in Mexico in 2009, is seen now as one of a variety of seasonal flu viruses and is included in annual flu vaccines, the scientists said that any preexisting population immunity ""does not provide protection against G4 viruses.""

They were keen to stress that the virus is not an immediate problem, however.

Professor Kin-Chow Chang, one of scientists involved in the study and who works at Nottingham University in the U.K., told the BBC that ""while this new virus is not an immediate problem ... We should not ignore it.""

""Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses.""

Current flu vaccines do not appear to protect against it, although they could possibly be adapted if needed, the BBC reported. To conduct their research, scientists carried out flu surveillance in pigs in 10 Chinese provinces between January 2011 and April 2018, and collected almost 30,000 nasal swabs taken from slaughtered pigs from abattoirs, as well as over 1,000 nasal swabs or lung tissue from farmed pigs with signs of respiratory disease.","× LOG IN SIGN UP Keep Me Logged In Skip Navigation SIGN IN Pro Watchlist Make It Select USA INTL Markets Pre-Markets U.S. Markets Europe Markets China Markets Asia Markets World Markets Currencies Cryptocurrency Futures & Commodities Bonds Funds & ETFs Watchlist Business Economy Finance Health & Science Media Real Estate Energy Transportation Industrials Retail Wealth Small Business Investing Invest In You Personal Finance Financial Advisors Trading Nation Options Action ETF Street Buffett Archive Earnings Trader Talk Tech Cybersecurity Enterprise Internet Media Mobile Social Media Venture Capital Tech Guide Politics White House Policy Defense Congress 2020 Elections Europe Politics China Politics Asia Politics World Politics CNBC TV Live Audio Latest Video Top Video CEO Interviews Europe TV Asia TV Digital Originals Menu SEARCH QUOTES Markets Pre-Markets U.S. Markets Europe Markets China Markets Asia Markets World Markets Currencies Cryptocurrency Futures & Commodities Bonds Funds & ETFs Watchlist Business Economy Finance Health & Science Media Real Estate Energy Transportation Industrials Retail Wealth Small Business Investing Invest In You Personal Finance Financial Advisors Trading Nation Options Action ETF Street Buffett Archive Earnings Trader Talk Tech Cybersecurity Enterprise Internet Media Mobile Social Media Venture Capital Tech Guide Politics White House Policy Defense Congress 2020 Elections Europe Politics China Politics Asia Politics World Politics CNBC TV Live Audio Latest Video Top Video CEO Interviews Europe TV Asia TV Digital Originals Menu Health and Science New strain of flu found in China has potential to become a pandemic, scientists warn Published Tue, Jun 30 2020 4:41 AM EDT Updated Tue, Jun 30 2020 11:12 AM EDT Holly Ellyatt @HollyEllyatt Key Points The new strain has descended from the type of flu (""swine flu"") that emerged in 2009 causing the first global flu pandemic in 40 years.

https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/nypl-lions-patience-and-fortitude-are-now-wearing-masks-good-new-yorkers,"The highly intelligent lions that guard the New York Public Library's main branch on 5th Avenue in Manhattan have masked up. Patience and Fortitude were given blue masks this morning, in an effort to set an example for New Yorkers. The masks are 3-feet wide, 2-feet tall, and go all the way over the nose.

This comes as some library branches will begin reopening on July 13th for grab-and-go service. At that time, ""masks will be mandatory to enter the branches to pick up or drop off materials.""

""The Library's beloved marble lions began wearing their own lion-sized masks to set an example and remind New Yorkers to stay safe and follow expert guidelines to combat the spread of COVID-19,"" a press release announced. (Would the Columbus statue ever wear a mask?)

The lions were originally called Leo Astor and Leo Lenox, according to the NYPL, after library founders John Jacob Astor and James Lenox (this was later changed to Lady Astor and Lord Lenox). In the 1930s, however, they got their forever names from Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who said they were named such ""for the qualities he felt New Yorkers would need to survive the economic depression.""

https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/opinion/barry-soper-is-the-greens-poverty-plan-a-flight-of-fantasy-think-again/,"COMMENT:

It's too easy to dismiss the Greens' Poverty Action Plan as a flight of fantasy - pie in the sky stuff that'll never happen.

But think again.

Making policy like they're planning takes power. And while the Greens may not have it at the moment, it could be a very different story after September 19.

The power in this Government lies with the Winston Peters' handbrake party, New Zealand First, the only party in the formal coalition. The Greens' opinion poll rating has been pretty consistent - above the 5 per cent threshold - whereas Labour's coalition cobbers are struggling at 2 to 3 per cent.

So chances are that after September 19, the Greens could well be where NZ First was after the last election and able to make demands - such as moving tax rates for those earning over a hundred grand to 37 per cent, and those on $150,000 having 42 per cent of their income going into the government's pocket. Currently, they're paying the top rate of 33 per cent.

The money earned there, and on taxing the wealthy (those with assets worth a million) being clobbered with a 1 per cent tax on anything above that - or 2 per cent on anything over $2 million - will go on a universal income. That means paying everyone not in full-time work $325 a week, which would include students.

It's a design for the redistribution of wealth, which Winston Peters says is nuts and nothing more than an envy tax. He likened it in a tweet to the view of Winston Churchill, who said taxing your way to prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket trying to lift himself up by the handle.

Consider this: Our tax brackets move earners on to the top rate once they hit $70,000, hardly enough to make ends meet, certainly with a family in Auckland. Today, 790,000 workers pay the top rate, and that number is growing.

But if you look at who's paying the lion's share in terms of dollars, those earning above a hundred grand a year pay 42 per cent of the income tax take.

If the Greens were serious about people paying a bit more, they should be progressively moving the income brackets above the piddling $70,000 (and forget the nutty universal income which is a disincentive for anyone to end up having anything to envy).

But the Greens are serious. They haven't ruled out their plan being a deal-breaker during coalition negotiations, and without Labour having another potential coalition partner at least they'll have an ear.

Labour was hammered on tax during the last election campaign. They should bear that in mind and distance themselves from it.

Smiling all the way to the ballot box if that doesn't happen will be National, which will be out selling what a Labour/Greens coalition could look like. And so too will be handbrake Peters, who'll be out there reminding the electorate of what he stopped Labour from doing (and there are plenty of examples) including the dead rats he forced the Greens to swallow because of his interference.

But as a reminder to Jacinda Ardern of what could be on the horizon, Julie Anne Genter tweeted: This is what transformational really looks like.",

Aberdeen University lecturer Neil McLennan and Scottish fiddler Thoren Ferguson launched the iSingForPeace project on the anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, which brought an official end to the First World War.

The national orchestra of Scotland is among contributors to 'Stronger for the Storm', with vocals from Scottish singer, songwriter and broadcaster Fiona Kennedy.

The project will culminate with a special performance on the afternoon of Remembrance Sunday, and in the meantime aims to ""reflect, remember and unite"" as a global community.

If you're missing Wimbledon - which should now be under way - there will be highlights shown throughout this week from tennis tournaments gone by. The great Federer-Nadal clash from 2008 is among the games you won't want to miss while serving up the strawberries and cream.

It goes without saying that The Telegraph's award-winning sports reporters will also be serving up ace content on matches gone by, in order to quench your tennis thirst.

As a survey finds that 53 per cent are now considering cycling to work, Transport for London has predicted that the surge in those preferring pedal power could be tenfold. Mark Bailey has more on the huge health benefits - which could lengthen your lifespan while maintaining your mood.

And the UK will come together this weekend for the 'biggest thank you ever' for coronavirus key workers. Broadcasters will pause their transmissions at 5pm on July 5as people across the country will clap not just the NHS but other workers who have helped to keep services and community networks going throughout the crisis.

Make sure to pop the kettle on - as neighbours, family and friends are encouraged to come together for a socially distanced cuppa while reflecting on the bonds that have kept us going in recent months.

Here’s Harriet with the rest of today’s good news:

The neighbours of a 16-year-old who was ""devastated"" when her prom was cancelled threw a surprise street party to celebrate instead. The community in Andover, Hampshire, decorated the street with fairy lights and balloons for Stacie Stroud, who has cerebral palsy and epilepsy Ms Stroud’s sister did her hair and make up, her grandfather picked her up in his yellow van and the neighbours cheered for her arrival. Her mum said: ""We had a bit of a socially-distanced disco in the evening… She cried when she arrived.""

A volunteer sewing squad in the United States has distributed more than 55,000 masks to vulnerable people in three months. The group, Auntie Sewing Squad, has 800 people sewing masks across the country.

Dozens of German doctors will be hosted for free on the Greek island of Kos from Monday, in “recognition and gratitude for their contribution in combating the coronavirus”. The flight of 170 doctors arrives two days before the country officially reopens its regional airport to passenger traffic.

Two pig farmers in Suffolk have successfully fed one million bees by turning over half their land – the equivalent of 83 football pitches – to wildflowers. The brothers, Mark and Paul Hayward, planted nectar-rich flowers and a seed mix of phacelia, sainfoin, birds-foot trefoil, alsike clover, musk mallow, campium and vetch. Paul said to Farming UK: “We are taking a very minor role in helping society restore a more favourable balance and this starts with plant diversity to encourage insects, bees, small mammals, and birds.”

https://1350kman.com/harrys-in-downtown-manhattan-to-close-for-good/,"After 30 years serving the Manhattan community, Harry’s Restaurants will close its doors for good mid-July.

Ownership made the announcement Monday, saying the impact of COVID-19 was too much to sustain. The upscale Downtown-based restaurant will continue to serve guests through July 17, corresponding its closure with its lease expiration.

“Harry’s has survived downturns; however, this one proves insurmountable,” Managing Partner Evan Grier says. “The impact of COVID-19 and the uncertainty ahead is too much for Harry’s to overcome.”

Harry’s was founded in 1990 by Julie Haynes before Evan and Andrea Grier bought the establishment in 2006, though has had the leadership of award-winning executive chef Cadell Bynum for over 25 years. They say the decision was “extremely difficult.

“Our team will forever cherish the fond memories created within these special walls alongside of our customers who chose us for some of the most important moments in their lives,” Evan Grier says. “They made Harry’s successful for three decades.”

The Grier’s, also known for opening Bourbon & Baker and the operating company of Tallgrass Tap House, say they will refocus their attentions on those properties and some new ventures on the horizon.

“Although it’s still in development, we are working to create a new concept for Manhattan and look forward to creating jobs for our team and community,” says Evan Grier.

The restaurant can be found on the ground floor of the Wareham Hotel, still owned by the namesake family. Andrea says they’ve been supportive of their venture throughout their 14-year ownership tenure.

“It has been an honor to be a part of the legacy of this landmark building,” says Andrea Grier. “We are eager to see what the future holds for the magical space at 418 Poyntz Avenue.”

The Griers are also notifying those with gift cards that it’s last call, encouraging them to use them before the oven goes cold for good.","               Personalities/Staff  Jobs  EEO  Calendar  Keeping it Local  Contest Rules  Contact Us  Login    RSS  Facebook  Twitter                          Navigate     Local News   Manhattan  Riley County  Wamego  Pottawatomie County  Fort Riley  Geary County    State News  Weather  Sports   K-State Sports  Manhattan High School  High School Sports   High School Basketball Schedules  High School Basketball Results and Standings    Student-Athlete of the Week  Big 12 Sports  Professional Sports    On Demand   In Focus  Who’s On In Focus  The Game  Managing Your Money by ESB Financial  Wildcat Insider    Obituaries  Message Studio           You are at: Home » Local News » Harry’s in Downtown Manhattan to close for good          Harry’s in Downtown Manhattan to close for good  0    By KMAN Staff   on  June 29, 2020    Local News , Manhattan       Harry’s Restaurant store front next to Manhattan’s iconic Wareham Theatre.

Kate Brown has belatedly agreed to send federal CARES Act funding to Jackson County and others to help ease the blow of the novel coronavirus shutdown. That’s welcome news, although it won’t cover all the economic damage the county suffered. But it will allow some assistance to businesses hit hard by the closure order. In all, the county expects to receive at least $7.7 million. Most of that money will go to reimburse the county’s direct expenses for providing medical gear such as personal protective equipment, virus testing and contact tracing. The county spent nearly $1.5 million from April 1 to May 15. County Administrator Danny Jordan estimates direct medical expenses through the end of the year will total about $4 million, but it could be more if the number of COVID-19 cases shows a dramatic increase. The rest of the federal aid, about $2.3 million, can be used to help businesses affected by the pandemic. Brown and state legislative leaders initially limited how much money they would distribute and restricted the use of the money to reimbursement for direct costs. At the same time, Portland-area counties were given federal aid directly because of their size, and permitted to use it for economic aid to businesses as well as direct costs. County commissioners here and in other smaller counties protested the state’s decision, and the League of Oregon Cities and Association of Oregon Counties went to bat on their behalf as well. Leaders in this region and other parts of the state have long objected to what they see as preferential treatment given to the Portland area, which has more representation in the Legislature because of its population.  What was especially galling about this situation was Jackson County’s success in keeping the number of COVID-19 cases low, while Portland and other cities saw much larger numbers. Brown and state leaders apparently listened to the concerns of the smaller counties and responded by doing the right thing and disbursing more money. That doesn’t mean the county will be fully compensated for its losses, which will include millions in various taxes and other sources of income affected by the coronavirus shutdown. And $2.3 million won’t go very far toward keeping businesses afloat and able to pay employees. Congress still may come through with additional stimulus money this summer, but that’s not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Southern Oregon residents must continue to do their part to limit the spread of this virus by practicing social distancing and wearing face masks in public. That will allow reopened businesses to keep operating, which will do more to stimulate the economy than any government assistance. The worst that could happen would be to stop taking precautions and cause a big increase in infections, forcing officials to retreat from reopening and reimpose closure orders.

Good Day Sky Dancers!

Today’s pictures are of women artists and their self portraits from the National Geographic and other sources.

There’s some very good news out of the Supreme Court today for Louisiana Women and women every where in the country! From NBC News: “Supreme Court, in 5-4 ruling, strikes down restrictive Louisiana abortion law. The measure would have required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of a clinic.”

The Supreme Court ruled Monday that Louisiana’s tough restriction on abortions violates the Constitution, a surprising victory for abortion rights advocates from an increasingly conservative court. The 5-4 decision, in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the court’s four more liberal justices, struck down a law passed by the Louisiana Legislature in 2014 that required any doctor offering abortion services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. Its enforcement had been blocked by a protracted legal battle. Two Louisiana doctors and a medical clinic sued to get the law overturned. They said it would leave only one doctor at a single clinic to provide services for nearly 10,000 women who seek abortions in the state each year. The challengers said the requirement was identical to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. With the vote of then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court ruled that Texas imposed an obstacle on women seeking access to abortion services without providing any medical benefits. Kennedy was succeeded by the more conservative Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump, who was among the four dissenters Monday. Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the Texas decision, also wrote Monday’s ruling. The law poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking an abortion, offers no significant health benefits, “and therefore imposes an undue burden on a woman’s constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.” Roberts said he thought the court was wrong to strike down the Texas law, but he voted with the majority because that was the binding precedent. “The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana’s law cannot stand under our precedents.”

Even small victories based on stare decisis are still victories.

Well, Iran always makes things interesting. You have to give them that. From The Sydney Morning Herald: “Iran issues arrest warrant for Donald Trump, requests help from Interpol.”

Tehran: Iran has issued an arrest warrant and asked Interpol to help detain US President Donald Trump and others it believes carried out a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad, a local prosecutor reportedly says.” While Trump faces no danger of arrest, the charges underscore the heightened tensions between Iran and the United States since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said Trump and more than 30 others whom Iran accuses of involvement in the January 3 strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad face “murder and terrorism charges,” the state-run IRNA news agency reported on Monday. Alqasimehr did not identify anyone else sought other than Trump, but stressed that Iran would continue to pursue his prosecution even after his presidency ends.

From BuzzFeed News: “Democrats Won’t Let Republicans Speak In Coronavirus Hearings If They Won’t Wear Masks. “We’re not going to have another meeting in a confined space if we’re not going to abide by this,” Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn told Republicans.”

Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis are threatening to bar Republican members from participating future meetings in-person after they showed up to a hearing on Friday without masks. Subcommittee Chair Jim Clyburn is sending a letter to ranking member Steve Scalise, warning he would not recognize members in hearings and meetings without proper face coverings; the chair must recognize members to speak and participate in committee business. “Going forward, as long as the Attending Physician’s requirement to wear masks is in place, I will not recognize any Member of this Subcommittee to participate in person in any Subcommittee meeting or hearing unless the Member is wearing a mask and strictly adheres to the Attending Physician’s guidance,” Clyburn said in a letter to Scalise. The letter further recommends members participate remotely if they insist on not wearing masks. The letter comes after a monthslong debate in Congress where Republicans have repeatedly disregarded recommendations and then a requirement from Capitol health experts to wear face coverings. The disagreement on the topic came to a head at the end of a Friday hearing when Clyburn reminded his Republican colleagues they were in violation of a mandate handed down by the attending physician, even as disposable masks were stationed outside the hearing room for members to use. “For the United States House of Representatives meetings, in a limited and closed space such as a committee hearing room for greater than 15 minutes face coverings are required,” Clyburn said, reading the Capitol health official’s order. “And we’re not going to have another meeting in a confined space if we’re not going to abide by this. I will stay in the safety of my home as I would ask all you to do.” Scalise responded to Clyburn by saying members of the House are following guidelines on how to social distance just fine, suggesting mask-wearing is an additional precautionary measure.

From Kyle Cheney at Politico: “House Dems propose strengthening Congress’ contempt power to break administration stonewalls. “We’ve seen unprecedented and illegal obstruction by the Trump administration to Congress,” Ted Lieu said.”

House Democrats increasingly frustrated by the Trump administration for defying subpoenas are proposing legislation that would ratchet up their power to punish executive branch officials who reject their requests. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), and five other membersof the House Judiciary Committee, unveiled a rule change Monday to formalize and expand Congress’ power of “inherent contempt” — its authority to unilaterally punish anyone who defies a subpoena for testimony or documents. Though Congress has long had inherent contempt power, it has been in disuse since before World War II. This power, upheld by courts, has included the ability to levy fines and even jail witnesses who refuse to cooperate with congressional demands. But such extreme measures have fallen out of favor over the years, as Congress has relied instead primarily on litigation to enforce its subpoenas and officials across government have acknowledged the unappetizing prospect of using force to impose its will. It’s even trickier when applied to a coequal branch of government, which may have its own privileges and protections to assert.

More news is coming forth about the Russian bounties. This is from WAPO: “Russian bounties to Taliban-linked militants resulted in deaths of U.S. troops, according to intelligence assessments.”

Russian bounties offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months. Several people familiar with the matter said it was unclear exactly how many Americans or coalition troops from other countries may have been killed or targeted under the program. U.S. forces in Afghanistan suffered a total of 10 deaths from hostile gunfire or improvised bombs in 2018, and 16 in 2019. Two have been killed this year. In each of those years, several service members were also killed by what are known as “green on blue” hostile incidents by members of Afghan security forces, which are sometimes believed to have been infiltrated by the Taliban. The intelligence was passed up from the U.S. Special Operations forces based in Afghanistan and led to a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March, the people said.

I was White House Staff Sec’y. Every document that goes to POTUS is literally stamped “The President Has Seen” and a record is kept. So, let the briefing docs testify. https://t.co/NBzHlVCGgx — Sean Patrick Maloney (@RepSeanMaloney) June 29, 2020

This is really unfolding in a particularly quick way. Here’s an opinion from Greg Sargent at WAPO’s Plum Line: “As Trump’s corruption gets worse, some Democrats want a tougher response.”

The big revelations of the moment — the reports that Russia may have paid bounties for the killing of U.S. troops, and the news that a U.S. attorney was ousted after investigating Trump cronies — are a reminder that Trump has found a gaping hole in our system. If a president refuses to cooperate with congressional oversight in just about every conceivable way — and if that president has the near-total backing of a party that controls one chamber of Congress — any such scrutiny can basically be ground to a halt, with no repercussions. But a group of House Democrats is now calling on its chamber to get a lot tougher in this regard. This group of Democrats — which is led by Rep. Ted Lieu of California and includes other high-profile lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee — is introducing a resolution Monday that, if successful, would dramatically increase the House’s ability to compel compliance with oversight. This resolution would create a new, modernized mechanism by which the House could seek to levy stiff fines on officials who defy subpoenas for testimony or documents. It would in effect bring into the 21st century a power that Congress has used only rarely in the past — the power to enforce its own subpoenas. “The administration can simply choose not to have witnesses appear and not produce documents, and there’s nothing we can do about it,” Lieu told me, noting that “we’ve seen the Trump administration getting worse, not better, in terms of both obstruction and engaging in reckless conduct.”

I'm calling for an immediate briefing from the Directors of National Intelligence and the CIA for all 100 Senators on reports that Russia placed bounties on US Troops in Afghanistan. We also need to know whether or not President Trump was told this information, and if so, when. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 29, 2020

One last OpEd piece from WAPO by Elizabeth Spiers: “Trump’s ‘silent majority’ isn’t a majority, and it’s far from silent. But the rhetoric lays the groundwork for crying foul when the true majority wins.”

The Trump team’s declaration that a silent majority lurks, ready to return Trump to the White House, is at odds with almost everything else the president says and does. His efforts to make it harder to vote by opposing voting by mail in the middle of a pandemic, and his repeated claims that Democrats are plotting election fraud, suggest a distinct nervousness about the majority’s true will. He appears to be laying the groundwork for explaining away a Democratic victory in November, as the result of deception and trickery. On June 22 he tweeted, in typical fashion: “RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!” In a system where success usually depends on grasping what a majority of the electorate wants, the sound strategy might be to reach out from one’s base to voters in the middle. Trump instead is heavily invested in the assumption that his enthusiastic minority will determine the outcome — even if it means that the people who don’t like him are prevented from voting.

These are hopeful signs in a fight to stop some of the most disturbing trends of the Trumpist Regime. However, the fight is on so many levels and we battle the rich and powerful and the firmly entrenched like Mitch McConnell. Take this idiot as an great example. He’s not on the front pages like Police Reform and Abortion Restrictions. And we still don’t make enough noise about voter restrictions in so many Republican-controlled states.

This jackass is the “acting” director, and has now been nominated. Not that it makes much of a difference as all most all of Trump’s lackeys are not confirmed.

The disagreement on the topic came to a head at the end of a Friday hearing when Clyburn reminded his Republican colleagues they were in violation of a mandate handed down by the attending physician, even as disposable masks were stationed outside the hearing room for members to use.  “For the United States House of Representatives meetings, in a limited and closed space such as a committee hearing room for greater than 15 minutes face coverings are required,” Clyburn said, reading the Capitol health official’s order. “And we’re not going to have another meeting in a confined space if we’re not going to abide by this. I will stay in the safety of my home as I would ask all you to do.”  Scalise responded to Clyburn by saying members of the House are following guidelines on how to social distance just fine, suggesting mask-wearing is an additional precautionary measure.  Self-Portrait, Lois Mailou Jones  From Kyle Cheney at Politico : “House Dems propose strengthening Congress’ contempt power to break administration stonewalls. “We’ve seen unprecedented and illegal obstruction by the Trump administration to Congress,” Ted Lieu said.”   House Democrats increasingly frustrated by the Trump administration for defying subpoenas are proposing legislation that would ratchet up their power to punish executive branch officials who reject their requests.  Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), and five other membersof the House Judiciary Committee, unveiled a rule change Monday to formalize and expand Congress’ power of “inherent contempt” — its authority to unilaterally punish anyone who defies a subpoena for testimony or documents.  Though Congress has long had inherent contempt power, it has been in disuse since before World War II. This power, upheld by courts, has included the ability to levy fines and even jail witnesses who refuse to cooperate with congressional demands.  But such extreme measures have fallen out of favor over the years, as Congress has relied instead primarily on litigation to enforce its subpoenas and officials across government have acknowledged the unappetizing prospect of using force to impose its will. It’s even trickier when applied to a coequal branch of government, which may have its own privileges and protections to assert.  Frida Kahlo Self Portrait With Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird  More news is coming forth about the Russian bounties.  This is from WAPO: “Russian bounties to Taliban-linked militants resulted in deaths of U.S. troops, according to intelligence assessments.”   Russian bounties offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months.  Several people familiar with the matter said it was unclear exactly how many Americans or coalition troops from other countries may have been killed or targeted under the program. U.S. forces in Afghanistan suffered a total of 10 deaths from hostile gunfire or improvised bombs in 2018, and 16 in 2019. Two have been killed this year. In each of those years, several service members were also killed by what are known as “green on blue” hostile incidents by members of Afghan security forces, which are sometimes believed to have been infiltrated by the Taliban.  The intelligence was passed up from the U.S. Special Operations forces based in Afghanistan and led to a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March, the people said.     I was White House Staff Sec’y. Every document that goes to POTUS is literally stamped “The President Has Seen” and a record is kept. So, let the briefing docs testify. https://t.co/NBzHlVCGgx  — Sean Patrick Maloney (@RepSeanMaloney) June 29, 2020     Joni Mitchell Self Portrait  This is really unfolding in a particularly quick way.  Here’s an opinion from Greg Sargent at WAPO’s Plum Line : “As Trump’s corruption gets worse, some Democrats want a tougher response.”   The big revelations of the moment — the reports that Russia may have paid bounties for the killing of U.S. troops, and the news that a U.S. attorney was ousted after investigating Trump cronies — are a reminder that Trump has found a gaping hole in our system.  If a president refuses to cooperate with congressional oversight in just about every conceivable way — and if that president has the near-total backing of a party that controls one chamber of Congress — any such scrutiny can basically be ground to a halt, with no repercussions.  But a group of House Democrats is now calling on its chamber to get a lot tougher in this regard.  This group of Democrats — which is led by Rep. Ted Lieu of California and includes other high-profile lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee — is introducing a resolution Monday that, if successful, would dramatically increase the House’s ability to compel compliance with oversight.  This resolution would create a new, modernized mechanism by which the House could seek to levy stiff fines on officials who defy subpoenas for testimony or documents. It would in effect bring into the 21st century a power that Congress has used only rarely in the past — the power to enforce its own subpoenas.  “The administration can simply choose not to have witnesses appear and not produce documents, and there’s nothing we can do about it,” Lieu told me, noting that “we’ve seen the Trump administration getting worse, not better, in terms of both obstruction and engaging in reckless conduct.”     I'm calling for an immediate briefing from the Directors of National Intelligence and the CIA for all 100 Senators on reports that Russia placed bounties on US Troops in Afghanistan.  We also need to know whether or not President Trump was told this information, and if so, when.  — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 29, 2020   Self-Portrait by South African Visual Artist Zanele Muholi  One last OpEd piece from WAPO by Elizabeth Spiers: “ Trump’s ‘silent majority’ isn’t a majority, and it’s far from silent. But the rhetoric lays the groundwork for crying foul when the true majority wins.”  The Trump team’s declaration that a silent majority lurks, ready to return Trump to the White House, is at odds with almost everything else the president says and does. His efforts to make it harder to vote by opposing voting by mail in the middle of a pandemic, and his repeated claims that Democrats are plotting election fraud, suggest a distinct nervousness about the majority’s true will. He appears to be laying the groundwork for explaining away a Democratic victory in November, as the result of deception and trickery. On June 22 he tweeted , in typical fashion: “RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!” In a system where success usually depends on grasping what a majority of the electorate wants, the sound strategy might be to reach out from one’s base to voters in the middle. Trump instead is heavily invested in the assumption that his enthusiastic minority will determine the outcome — even if it means that the people who don’t like him are prevented from voting.  These are hopeful signs in a fight to stop some of the most disturbing trends of the Trumpist Regime.  However, the fight is on so many levels and we battle the rich and powerful and the firmly entrenched like Mitch McConnell. Take this idiot as an great example. He’s not on the front pages like Police Reform and Abortion Restrictions.  And we still don’t make enough noise about voter restrictions in so many Republican-controlled states.      This jackass is the “acting” director, and has now been nominated. Not that it makes much of a difference as all most all of Trump’s lackeys are not confirmed.

Just as he was briefed regarding the virus, he knew.  Just as he was advised by 17 intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election.  He knew.  He just does not care.  Whatever Russia has on him will eventually surface.  But this last one takes the cake.  Refusing to address the issue with the country using our military for target practice but still playing “kissy face” with Putin.  What will it take?

Reply        bostonboomer  says:   June 29, 2020 at 3:28 pm     If true, the report that Putin put bounties on US servicemembers' heads is an act of war & demands a proportional response.

The claim comes in a report in the president’s favourite news outlet that cites a number of GOP insiders who are concerned about Mr Trump’s re-election prospects amid abysmal polling numbers….  Charles Gasparino, the author of the Fox News report, said in a series of tweets that he had spoken to “major players” in the Republican party for the story. One of them described Mr Trump’s mood as “fragile” as his chances of a second-term looked increasingly dim.  Another of the GOP sources cited in the report said of the likelihood that Mr Trump will drop out: “I’ve heard the talk but I doubt it’s true. My bet is, he drops if he believes there’s no way to win.”  Reply        quixote  says:   June 29, 2020 at 9:50 pm   Bwahaha.

https://resourcehub.blackbaud.com.au/spirit-of-fundraising/good-news-from-childfund-australia,"March Appeal doubled income against previous year

ChildFund Australia’s March appeal on maternal health in Timor-Leste raised $100k; double the income of the previous year. This was a collaborative effort that involved great coordination between ChildFund’s Direct & Digital, Philanthropy and Communications teams, as well as direct marketing agencies.

Challenges

Just after the appeal had lodged, COVID-19 struck. Our entire office was going through what everyone in our world was. Reforecasts. Tension. Uncertainty. Serious concern about all the individuals around the globe impacted and our loved ones. There was also significant concern about whether any donors could still give and whether we should proceed with a tax appeal.



We had a number of new team members join (Jon-Paul Sandercock and Naomi Henry) who, in conjunction with Direct Marketing Manager Kevin Truong, were really instrumental in making the campaign a success and taking our direct marketing program to new heights.



We managed to reduce costs compared to the prior year by 17% moving our net income from $14k the prior year to almost $75k.



Impact

Overall, the income raised was $102,405 against $48,329 last year. Our response rate also up 14%. Our ROI improved from 1.41 to 3.6. Net income rose from $14,040 to $73,933 and the amount of major gifts obtained also improved significantly from 2019 to 2020.

We changed the signatory from our CEO to Rita Mu, who is a member of the communications team. She wrote a very personal account as she had been seconded to Timor-Leste for 3 months in 2019, and also has family from Timor-Leste. Rita met with individuals featured as case studies in person, and took all images for the campaign.

The opening line of the copy had a lot of power, with Rita noting that despite Timor-Leste's close geographical proximity, maternal mortality rates continue to remain high, with little change since her father’s birth there over 40 years ago.

One of the key principles in direct mail is ensuring the relationship between the signatory and donor is an authentic one and I feel as a team we did this in a very honest and genuine way. Our campaign was boosted by working in close collaboration with our major donor team who also broke records for a March campaign.

It was an incredibly collaborative effort and it seems that tax is on track to beat last year as well despite COVID-19 which is really important because our organisation is facing incredibly challenging conditions in the environments we are operating.

The most important thing is that the appeal gave our Timor office vital funds which were so uncertain under the post COVID-19 environment. We will be reporting back to donors on the impact of their donations in the next few weeks but we also collaborated with our programs team on a thank you video with people sending videos in from Timor-Leste stating how much a major donor’s gift meant to them personally.

https://truepundit.com/the-good-news-about-covid-19-the-corporate-media-keeps-hidden/,"As the pandemic panic porn continues because identified cases are rising, Dr. Fauci is back on television, and the media is once again demanding a national response. However, there is news they don’t share with you that could help reduce the already unwarranted levels of fear. Obviously, that doesn’t fit their partisan agenda.

Many commentators have noted that rising case numbers are not necessarily a reason to sound the alarm. The fear with COVID-19 was always of overwhelming the hospital system. The correct numbers to look at are COVID-19 hospitalizations, the percent of positive tests, and the age breakdown for severe disease.

A doctor from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said in a press conference Wednesday that people who are testing positive do not appear to be getting as sick as they did earlier in the pandemic. Dr. Donald Yealy also noted this trend was being seen in the wake of massive protests.

He suggested the country is focusing too much on rising COVID-19 case counts.

“We need to change our mindset and focus not exclusively on the number of cases, but on the severity of illness. We shouldn’t just be counting those who have a diagnosed infection,” Yealy said. “For the vast majority of people testing positive, their illness is mild, or they don’t even know they have any symptoms of COVID-19 infection.”

Dr. Yealy also noted that the positive case rate was about one in 400, which has remained steady for weeks. He also noted improved treatment protocols and some success with Remdisivir and other medications. Effective treatment is in addition to some success protecting the elderly and a much younger patient load testing positive. – READ MORE
