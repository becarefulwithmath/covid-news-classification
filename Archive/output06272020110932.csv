1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on June 25, 2020 to reflect available data as of May 29, 2020. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.

People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:

Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy.

of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy. Do not delay getting emergency care for your underlying medical condition because of COVID-19. Emergency departments have contingency infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care.

People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:  People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:   Chronic kidney disease  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant  Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)  Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies  Sickle cell disease  Type 2 diabetes mellitus   Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.  COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:   Asthma (moderate-to-severe)  Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)  Cystic fibrosis  Hypertension or high blood pressure  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines  Neurologic conditions, such as dementia  Liver disease  Pregnancy  Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)  Smoking  Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)  Type 1 diabetes mellitus   Want to see the evidence behind these lists?  The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.  Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19  It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.  The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:   Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.  Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.   If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.  Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.  As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities , running errands, and attending events and gatherings . There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.  People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves . Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.  In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.   If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions .  Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.  If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.   Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:  When to delay or cancel a visit   Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.  Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms .   In general,  the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread . So, think about :   How many people will you interact with?  Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?  Will you be outdoors or indoors?  What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?   Encourage social distancing during your visit   Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing .  Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.  Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.  Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.  If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.  Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.   Wear cloth face coverings   Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.  Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others  Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.    Who should NOT use cloth face coverings : Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.   Wash hands often   Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.  If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.  Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.  Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.   Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items   Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.  Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.  If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.   If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:  If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:  Lowest risk : Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.  More risk : Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).  Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.  Highest risk : Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.  Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic  Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.   It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.  Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress .   If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:   Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.  Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider , insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy.  Do not delay getting emergency care for your underlying medical condition because of COVID-19. Emergency departments have contingency infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care.  Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your underlying medical conditions or if you get sick and think that you may have COVID-19.

1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html,"Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:","                                                Skip directly to site content  Skip directly to page options  Skip directly to A-Z link     Self-Checker               Coronavirus Self-Checker   ×                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CDC COVID Data Tracker      Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.     Risk for Severe Illness Increases with Age  As you get older, your risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases. For example, people in their 50s are at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 40s. Similarly, people in their 60s or 70s are, in general, at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 50s. The greatest risk for severe illness from COVID-19 is among those aged 85 or older.  There are also other factors that can increase your risk for severe illness, such as having underlying medical conditions. By understanding the factors that put you at an increased risk, you can make decisions about what kind of precautions to take in your daily life.   As you get older, your risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 increases. Everyone, especially older adults and others at increased risk of severe illness, should take steps to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.     In general, your risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19 increases as you get older. In fact, 8 out of 10 COVID-19-related deaths reported in the United States have been among adults aged 65 years and older .      Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.

1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),5,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/immunocompromised.html,"Many conditions and treatments can weaken a person’s immune system (making them “immunocompromised”). Some of these include:

Cancer

Bone marrow transplant

Solid organ transplant

Stem cells for cancer treatment

Genetic immune deficiencies

HIV

Use of oral or intravenous corticosteroids or other medicines called immunosuppressants that lower the body’s ability to fight some infections (e.g., mycophenolate, sirolimus, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, etanercept, rituximab)

Risk of Severe Illness from COVID- 19

People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They may also remain infectious for a longer period of time than others with COVID-19, but we cannot confirm this until we learn more about this new virus.

Prevent COVID-19

If you are immunocompromised, the best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to this virus. For details, see CDC’s advice for what you can do to prepare for COVID-19 and how to protect yourself and others.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol . Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Avoid leaving home as much as possible and practice social distancing. If you must leave home, avoid other people as much as possible by practicing social distancing. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters) between you and people outside your household. Avoid large gatherings or places where people congregate. Have supplies, food, and medicine delivered to your home.

Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering when around others to protect other people in case you are infected, and ask others to do the same. Remember, do NOT place cloth face coverings on children younger than 2 years old, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance.

Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Health

Continue your regular treatment plan. Don’t stop any medications or treatments without talking to your doctor. Discuss any concerns about your treatment with your doctor. Keep your regularly scheduled medical appointments. Talk to your doctor about steps they are taking to reduce risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the office. Use telehealth services whenever possible if recommended by your doctor. Ensure that you are getting necessary tests prescribed by your doctor. Seek urgent medical care if you are feeling unwell.

Talk to your doctor, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an emergency supply of prescription medications. Make sure you have at least 30 days of prescription medications, over-the-counter medicines, and supplies on hand in case you need or want to stay home for several weeks. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about ways to receive your medications by mail.

Take steps to care for your emotional health. Fear and anxiety about COVID-19 can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions. It is natural to feel concerned or stressed about COVID-19. Learn more about stress and coping with anxiety here. Call your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row.

Treatment of COVID-19

At this time, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for COVID-19. There is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Treatment is currently aimed at relieving symptoms, and for hospitalized patients, supporting vital organ function during severe illness.

Additional Information for Specific Conditions & Risk Factors

If you have cancer or have survived cancer

If you have cancer now or had cancer in the past, you might need to take special steps to protect your health:

Chemotherapy is an important tool to treat cancer. Although some types of chemotherapy can weaken the immune system, cancer patients and survivors should continue to take their chemotherapy as directed by their doctor.

Do not change your cancer treatment plan without discussing it with your doctor.

Watch out for fever. Take your temperature any time you feel warm, flushed, chilled, very fatigued, or not well. Call your doctor right away if you have a temperature of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher. Know the signs and symptoms of infection . Infection during the course of cancer treatment can be very serious. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of an infection.

Find out from your doctor when your white blood cell count is likely to the be the lowest, since this is when you’re most at risk for infection. If you have to go to the emergency room, tell the person checking you in that you are a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy. Fever during chemotherapy treatment is a medical emergency and you should be seen quickly.

Discuss any concerns about your chemotherapy or other cancer treatments with your oncologist and primary healthcare provider.

Learn more about Types of Cancer, Risk Factors and Screening for Cancer and Preventing Infections while undergoing treatment for cancer.

If you have had a bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, or stem cells for cancer treatment

If you take medications that weaken your immune system, called immunosuppressant medications:

Do not change or stop taking medicines without talking to your doctor. Stopping or changing medicine can cause serious health problems.

If you were born with immune deficiencies

Some people are born with or develop immune deficiencies due to genetics. Examples include common variable immune deficiency, selective IgA deficiency, severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiencies.

If you take medicines to help boost your immune system, do not change or stop them without talking to your doctor.

If you have HIV

The risk of serious illness from COVID-19 for people with HIV is not yet known. If you have HIV and a low CD4 cell count or are not on HIV treatment, you might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Do not change or stop taking medicines without talking to your doctor. Stopping or changing medicine can cause serious health problems.

For more details, see CDC’s Information about COVID for people with HIV.

If you are using oral or intravenous corticosteroids or other medicines that lower your immune system’s response

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52849691,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People sunbathing on the beach by Bournemouth pier as lockdown eases

Relaxing lockdown is a risk because levels of the coronavirus are still ""very high"", one of the government's top science advisers says.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait.

The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings.

One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.

'Little time for stringent measures'

""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.

Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases.

They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase.

Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus.

But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.

The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports.

Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over.

However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"".

The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick.

This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Behavioural scientists advising government ""strongly recommend"" monitoring how well people were keeping to the rules.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours.

The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective.

'Taking a risk'

However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster.

Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here.""

And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day.

Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate.

The documents also showed:

On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""

The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.

Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts

In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""

The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings

Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""

The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk

Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""

Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms

Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1

Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.

""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence.""

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.businessinsider.com/riskiest-to-least-risky-activities-during-coronavirus-pandemic-ranked-2020-5,"The risk of catching the coronavirus by venturing out of your house is not all or nothing.

We spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky and which you should try to avoid.

Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said.

Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.

While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly.

Here's what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country.","                                       The words ""Business Insider"".

Mohamed Azakir/Reuters            The risk of catching the coronavirus by venturing out of your house is not all or nothing. We spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky and which you should try to avoid. Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said. Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said. Visit Business Insider&apos;s homepage for more stories .    Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry. As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what&apos;s safe and what should be avoided. Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won&apos;t help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote. So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.    While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly. Here&apos;s what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country.               High risk: Gatherings of family or friends           People at a pool party.  Shutterstock/Jacob Lund    Getting together with family or friends who don&apos;t live in your household comes with a high risk of infection, Hassig said. ""If you haven&apos;t been living with them, then there&apos;s a potential risk,"" she said. Family and friends are unlikely to wear masks or social distance at these gatherings, and asymptomatic people could spread the virus there. If you do decide to get together with family or friends, you should consider the age and underlying conditions of the people there and those you live with. You should also consider who your friends could have come into contact with. Are they mostly staying at home? Are they visiting different friends every day? ""It&apos;s not just your friend"" you&apos;re seeing, Hassig said — ""it&apos;s everybody they&apos;ve spent time with.""           High risk: Bars           People toast the reopening of the Friends and Neighbors bar in Appleton, Wisconsin, following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Gov. Tony Evers' safer-at-home order on May 13.  William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS    Bars ""should not be allowed to open,"" Hassig said. The nature of bars — mingling, crowded bartops, and the inability to wear a mask while you&apos;re drinking — make them a high-risk place for getting a coronavirus infection, Hassig said. And alcohol can hinder decision-making, which could make those factors even worse.           High risk: Religious functions           People wearing face masks attend a service at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea, on May 10.  Associated Press    Rituals like shaking hands and taking communion in the Catholic Church, as well as dense crowds and the prevalence of older people, make religious services a high-risk place for coronavirus infections. The risk could be lowered by social distancing, wearing masks, and abstaining from rituals that involve touching, eating, or drinking.           High risk: Movie theaters and sporting events           A Regency Theatre.  Kevork Djansezian/Reuters    Movie theaters or large events like sporting games have a high risk especially because of the crowding at entries and exits. Even if attendees can enter and exit while social distancing — which would likely be complicated and take longer — getting infected while sitting in a contained area is still a risk.           Medium to high risk: Gyms           A person exercising at a Gold's Gym that reopened in Georgia.  Maranie Staab/Reuters    Gymgoers should wear a mask when possible, Hassig said. Equipment should be sanitized before and after each use, and social distancing should be enforced rigorously.           Medium risk: Restaurants (indoors)           Servers wearing gloves and masks get takeout orders from the kitchen at a restaurant in Houston, Texas, on May 1.  MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images    Indoor dining at restaurants is risky because of airflow and people being in an enclosed space for hours at a time. To help mitigate the risks of eating in a restaurant, people should wear masks until their food is delivered. Disposable materials, especially for things like menus, can also help.           Medium risk: Hair and nail salons           A man washes a customer's hair at a hair salon in Atlanta on April 27.  Jessica McGowan/Getty Images    Hair and nail salons, which have opened in several states, have a medium risk of infection, Hassig said. Wearing masks is critical, as it helps block particles from spreading as easily when you&apos;re speaking or coughing. It also discourages employees and customers from touching their faces. Salon employees should be sure to wash their hands frequently, Hassig said.           Medium risk: Dates or gatherings with a couple of friends           Two people eating.  David Mercado/Reuters    When it comes to dates or gatherings with a very small group, the same questions apply as with larger group gatherings. Geography also matters: In an area with a lot of cases, like New York, the risk that your date could be contagious is higher than in a suburb with only a handful of cases.           Low to medium risk: Beaches           A man rides his bike on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu in April.  Caleb Jones/AP Photo    Social distancing on beaches can help lower the risk of catching the coronavirus while you&apos;re enjoying a day in the sun. But it can also be hard to enforce because of the size of many beaches — they usually have many points of entry, so it would be difficult to limit capacity.           Low risk: Outdoor dining           A restaurant's outdoor dining area.  Sam Greenwood/Getty Images    Dining outdoors at a restaurant is a relatively low-risk activity as long as tables are kept at least 6 feet apart. Being outside allows air to flow more freely. You should still wear a mask as often as you can and be cautious of high-touch items like menus and condiments.           Low risk: Outdoor activities           A person hiking in Glacier National Park.  Galyna Andrushko/Shutterstock    When you&apos;re on a hike or a walk in the park, you shouldn&apos;t worry too much about quickly walking past another person on a path or trail. While you should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all times, encounters of more than 15 minutes are riskier than walking past someone. Outdoor activities are low risk if you stay with people from your household. If you meet up with other friends or family, that still counts as a gathering, and proper precautions should be taken.           Low risk: Shopping           A worker adjusting a sign at a Walmart.   Joe Raedle/Getty Images)     Shopping in a grocery store or a clothing store can be low risk if you keep a distance from others and wear a mask. Fitting rooms should be closed, or if people are allowed to try on clothes, anything that isn&apos;t purchased should be quarantined for a couple of days, Hassig said. The place in stores with the most risk is the checkout, where interactions with cashiers or other customers could help spread the virus.           Low risk: Touching mail or groceries           A United States Postal Service worker delivering mail in Philadelphia on April 2.  Associated Press    There&apos;s a low risk of catching the coronavirus from touching your mail or other items like groceries. Hassig said she doesn&apos;t wipe down her groceries — but if you&apos;re worried about it, you can keep nonperishable items in the grocery bag for a few days before using them. You should still be cautious about touching things like doorknobs and elevator buttons.           Something is loading.

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-by-activity-restaurant-hotel-gym-salon-date-2020-6,"There is no public activity that is risk-free during the coronavirus pandemic.

But some activities, like going for a walk with a friend, are less risky than others, like attending a big indoor party.

Here are 15 common everyday activities, ranked from least to most risky for catching the coronavirus.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Our collective patience with the coronavirus is growing thin.

""We're all getting tired of staying at home,"" Jay Butler, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's deputy director of infectious diseases, said on a phone call with reporters earlier this month.

But, ""the pandemic is not over, and it's important to recognize that,"" Butler said.

As restaurants, bars, hair salons, as well as many homes and offices continue opening up again, it's good to remember that some activities are still far more risky than others when it comes to contracting the illness caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19.

""Here's a general rule of thumb: the more closely you interact with others, the longer the interaction lasts, and the greater the number of people involved in the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread,"" Butler said.

Good handwashing practices, especially before eating or touching your face, keeping a safe distance from others when possible, and using face masks or shields when out in public are all still good practices to maintain. It's also prudent to avoid long visits to crowded spaces.

""This virus likes the possibility of close quarters,"" epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead for COVID-19, said during a regular press briefing on June 22. ""Whether that's at home, or whether that's at work, we need to ensure that we make sure we prevent these outbreaks from happening.""

Here are a few ideas for activities that are some of the safest choices right now, and a few of the worst:

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://theconversation.com/americans-disagree-on-how-risky-the-coronavirus-is-but-most-are-changing-their-behavior-anyway-133991,"As the coronavirus began to spread in the United States, people faced an unknown risk and evolving health recommendations. Policy measures to curb the coronavirus epidemic have turned the world upside down, and the true impact of this global pandemic is yet to be seen.

Researchers are still learning more about the virus every day, but how do members of the general public perceive the risks associated with COVID-19? Do these beliefs affect what people have been doing to protect themselves? As social scientists, we’re interested in understanding how people’s beliefs and behaviors evolved in the face of this novel threat.

We launched a survey through the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study to find out. Running from March 10 through March 16, the survey covered a period of time when the information available to the public and the situation on the ground were both rapidly changing. We were able to see how people’s perceptions of risk and their actions were changing from day to day.

As this crisis continues, it is important to understand what people think about the risks and how they are behaving. If, for example, people are seeing low risks and not implementing recommended actions, then public health communications may need to address that.

Do people in the US think they’ll get COVID-19?

Theories of health behavior suggest that people who think that a risk is higher are more likely to implement protective behaviors.

Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the risks are still not fully understood by experts, much less the general public. Perhaps as a result, most of our survey respondents initially believed that their chance of getting the coronavirus was relatively low.

But over the course of our weeklong survey, reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose from 937 to 4,226. Additionally, halfway through our survey, the government imposed multiple travel bans, barring most travelers from Europe.

As people in the U.S. learned of these events, their perceived risk of getting the coronavirus increased. To measure this, we asked people what they thought their chances were for getting the coronavirus over the next three months.

The median belief on March 10, at the beginning of our survey, was 10% – meaning half of those surveyed thought their chances were less than 10% and half thought their chances were greater.

When we closed out the survey on March 16, the median prediction had gone up to 15%. The increase suggests that people were updating their beliefs as the virus started to spread across the United States day by day. They were perhaps starting to realize that they may be more vulnerable than they’d initially thought.

When we dug deeper into our survey data, we found that not everyone was convinced that they would be getting infected with the coronavirus. The distribution was skewed to the left, with its peak at the low end of the scale. Across all of our respondents, nearly a quarter thought they had a zero or near-zero chance of getting coronavirus in the next three months. Yet, a not-insignificant number of people thought they had a very high chance of getting it. Perhaps that explains why some people were still out partying over the weekend of March 14-15 while others stayed home and committed to social distancing.

Time will tell which of these risk perceptions is correct. However, it may be overly positive to think that the chances will be zero. Psychologists have suggested that people have a tendency to underestimate their personal risks of experiencing negative events to help cope with an uncertain and scary world. This idea that “it can’t happen to me” is called unrealistic optimism and could explain the large number of people who think they face almost no risk getting the coronavirus.

This group worried us. Because risk perceptions tend to inform behaviors, people who see low risks of getting sick may not feel the need to follow recommended health behaviors like hand-washing and social distancing. Unexpectedly, this is not what we found.

What are people doing?

In our survey, we asked people whether they had engaged in behaviors to keep safe from the coronavirus, like hand-washing, canceling travel or social distancing. And to our surprise, most people said that they had already started doing these things – even if they saw relatively low chances of getting sick. By the end of the week, on March 16, nearly 89% of respondents said they were practicing social distancing, 32% higher than on the first day of the survey.

So why this seeming contradiction between belief and behavior? We think one reason could be that people felt safer as a result of implementing those actions. Doing something may have given them a feeling of control and a sense of security.

Another reason for stepping up protective actions could be that people wanted to respond to the messages to “flatten the curve” and to protect others – especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions.

Even in regular flu seasons, some people may be motivated to take protective actions to help others. Such altruistic motives may make people feel good about themselves, while also supporting the optimistic view that they themselves were not at risk. Engaging in those actions together with others in the community may also have further contributed to this positive outlook.

Our survey captured an interesting time of rapid change during the early days of this pandemic. It showed that there is large variation in how likely people think they are to get the coronavirus. But we also found that the vast majority of people are stepping up their protective actions – even among those that didn’t expect to get sick themselves. These findings suggest that people seem to be responding to calls to change their behavior, no matter how vulnerable – or invulnerable – they think they are.

Policy measures to curb the coronavirus epidemic have turned the world upside down, and the true impact of this global pandemic is yet to be seen.  Researchers are still learning more about the virus every day, but how do members of the general public perceive the risks associated with COVID-19? Do these beliefs affect what people have been doing to protect themselves? As social  scientists, we’re interested in understanding how people’s beliefs and behaviors evolved in the face of this novel threat.  We launched a survey through the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study to find out. Running from March 10 through March 16, the survey covered a period of time when the information available to the public and the situation on the ground were both rapidly changing. We were able to see how people’s perceptions of risk and their actions were changing from day to day .  As this crisis continues, it is important to understand what people think about the risks and how they are behaving. If, for example, people are seeing low risks and not implementing recommended actions, then public health communications may need to address that.  Do people in the US think they’ll get COVID-19?  Theories of health behavior suggest that people who think that a risk is higher are more likely to implement protective behaviors .  Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the risks are still not fully understood by experts , much less the general public. Perhaps as a result, most of our survey respondents initially believed that their chance of getting the coronavirus was relatively low.  But over the course of our weeklong survey, reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose from 937 to 4,226 . Additionally, halfway through our survey, the government imposed multiple travel bans , barring most travelers from Europe.   As people in the U.S. learned of these events, their perceived risk of getting the coronavirus increased . To measure this, we asked people what they thought their chances were for getting the coronavirus over the next three months.  The median belief on March 10, at the beginning of our survey, was 10% – meaning half of those surveyed thought their chances were less than 10% and half thought their chances were greater.  When we closed out the survey on March 16, the median prediction had gone up to 15%. The increase suggests that people were updating their beliefs as the virus started to spread across the United States day by day. They were perhaps starting to realize that they may be more vulnerable than they’d initially thought.  When we dug deeper into our survey data, we found that not everyone was convinced that they would be getting infected with the coronavirus.

Playing golf is safer than playing basketball during the coronavirus pandemic, four public health experts say. Golf is safer than going bowling, too.

Golf is not safer than tennis.

The MLive website recently asked four public health experts to assess the risk 36 activities pose to spreading the coronavirus, and golf was deemed one of the least risky – but not the least, and not even the least risky sport.

The experts rated the activities on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most risky and 1 being the least, and MLive averaged the numbers. The least risky activity was “playing tennis,” followed by “getting takeout from a restaurant,” each scoring a one. The riskiest activity was “bars,” followed by “large music venues,” each scoring a nine.

Golf was rated a three and was 31st out of the 36 activities. Following golf were “libraries and museums,” “going for a walk, run or bike ride with others,” “getting fuel” and tennis and restaurant takeout.

Golf, the story reported, recorded a low score because it’s outside, it’s a non-contact sport and it features small groups of people. The risk goes up a bit when those people meet other people on the course.

“Just play golf, say hi and bye, and go on your merry way,” Dr. Nasir Husain, the Henry Ford Macomb medical director for infection prevention, told MLive. “Don’t come close to each other.”

Tennis, the story wrote, brings “little concern.” “Spacing is part of the game, it’s typically outdoors and there’s only two to four people on a court,” the story said. “While some sports activities cause concern for the health experts, tennis is not one of them.”

The experts told MLive the numbers will drop if safety measures are followed, and rise if they aren’t.

“Until we have a vaccine, we are going to have to move forward with risk reduction strategies,” Dr. Matthew Sims, the Beaumont Health director of infectious disease research, told MLive. “Because you can’t keep the economy on hold forever, you can’t keep peoples’ lives on hold forever.”

The ranking of the activities:

9: Bars; large music concerts

8: Sports stadiums; gyms; amusement parks; churches; buffets

7: Basketball; public pools; schools

6: Casinos; restaurants, indoor seating; playgrounds; hair salons, barbershops; pontoon boat rides; movie theaters

5: Dinner parties at a house; airplanes; backyard barbecues; malls; beaches; bowling

4: Dentist’s offices; walking in a busy downtown; offices; doctor’s office waiting rooms; eating outside at a restaurant

3: Getting groceries; camping; hotels; golfing; libraries and museums

2: Going for a walk, run or bike ride with others; getting fuel
