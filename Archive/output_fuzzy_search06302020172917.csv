https://sunnybrook.ca/research/media/item.asp?c=2&i=2069&f=covid-19-isolated-2020#.XmqdRmlrVfY.twitter,"A team of researchers from Sunnybrook, McMaster University and the University of Toronto has isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.



Thanks to nimble collaboration, the team was able to culture the virus from two clinical specimens in a Level 3 containment facility.



“We need key tools to develop solutions to this pandemic. While the immediate response is crucial, longer-term solutions come from essential research into this novel virus,” said Dr. Samira Mubareka, microbiologist and infectious diseases physician at Sunnybrook.



The isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, evolution and clinical shedding.



“Researchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,” said Dr. Rob Kozak, clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook. “It demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate.”



Dr. Arinjay Banerjee, NSERC post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University, said he knows the collaboration won’t stop there.



“Now that we have isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we can share this with other researchers and continue this teamwork,” he said. “The more viruses that are made available in this way, the more we can learn, collaborate and share.”



Congratulations to the researchers from these three Canadian institutions: Dr. Samira Mubareka and Dr. Rob Kozak of Sunnybrook and University of Toronto; Dr. Arinjay Banerjee and Dr. Karen Mossman of McMaster University.



With gratitude to the CL3 team and Biosafety Officers.

Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – has proven hard to kill. But viruses rely on cellular mechanisms in human cells to help them spread, so it should be possible to change an aspect of a person’s body to prevent that and slow down the virus enough to allow the immune system to fight the invader off.  I am a quantitative biologist, and my lab built a map of how the coronavirus uses human cells . We used that map to find already existing drugs that could be repurposed to fight COVID-19 and have been working with an international group of researchers called the QBI Coronavirus Research Group to see if the drugs we identified showed any promise . Many have .  For years, researchers have suspected that kinases – biological control switches that viruses use to take over cells – could be targeted to fight infections . Over the last few months, we built a second, more detailed map looking specifically for the kinases that the coronavirus is hijacking.  Using this map, we identified a few already existing cancer drugs which alter the function of the kinases that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks, and began testing them in coronavirus-infected cells. The results of these early tests are promising enough that we are working with some groups and have already begun human clinical trials.     This map shows how the coronavirus changes the function of kinases – cellular switches involved in most biological processes – and the proteins they control. It guided researchers from UCSF to cancer drugs that could fight COVID-19.  Bouhaddou et al. © Elsevier 2020 , CC BY-ND    Kinases in disease and as drug targets  Kinases are proteins found in every cell of our body. There are 518 human kinases , and they act as major control hubs for virtually all processes in the body. They are able to add a small marker – a process called phosphorylation – to other proteins and thus change how, if and when a phosphorylated protein can do its work.  For example, if a cell is preparing to grow – say to heal a cut on your finger – specific kinases will turn on and start telling proteins involved in cell growth what to do. Many cancers are caused by overactive kinases leading to uncontrolled cell growth, and drugs that slow kinases down can be highly effective at treating cancer.  Kinases are central players in cellular function as well as in most diseases, so researchers and pharmaceutical companies have studied them in great detail .  Kinases are also fairly easy to target with drugs because of how they add phosphorylation markers to proteins . Researchers have developed a huge number of drugs, particularly cancer drugs, that work by essentially throwing a wrench into the mechanics of specific kinases in order to stop cell growth.  So what does this have to do with the coronavirus? Well, viruses and cancer actually have more in common than you might think. Cancer is essentially a malfunctioning of cellular machinery that causes runaway cell growth.  Viruses also change the function of cellular machinery – albeit on purpose – but instead of causing cell growth, the machinery is repurposed to produce more viruses. Not surprisingly, viruses take control over many kinases to do this.     Microscope image shows a cell infected with SARS-CoV-2 and filopodia growths (in white) extending out from the cell surface containing viral particles (in red).  Dr. Robert Grosse, CIBSS,  University of Freiburg / Bouhaddou et al. © Elsevier 2020 , CC BY-ND    Coronavirus at the controls  This idea – that SARS-CoV-2 is using kinases to hijack cellular machinery – is why we wanted to build a map of every kinase that is taken over by the coronavirus. Any virus–kinase interaction could be a potential target for drugs.  To do this, we first infected green monkey cells – which are fairly good surrogates for human cells when it comes to virus infection – with SARS-CoV-2. We then ground up these infected cells and used a device called a mass spectrometer to see which proteins were phosphorylated in these infected cells. We then did the same thing with healthy cells.  It is impossible to actually see which kinases are activated at any time, but since each kinase can attach phosphorylation markers to only a few specific proteins , researchers can look at the phosphorylated proteins to determine what kinases are active at any time.  We made two lists: one list of phosphorylated proteins in healthy cells and one list of phosphorylated proteins in infected cells. We then compared the two, and by looking at the differences between the infected and uninfected lists, we were able to determine which kinases the coronavirus uses to reproduce.  Because researchers still don’t fully understand what all 518 human kinases do , we were able to look for effects in only 97 of the ones we know most about. But that turned out to be more than enough. Of those 97 kinases, we found 49 that the virus affects.  Some of the more interesting ones include Casein Kinase 2 , which is involved in controlling how a cell is shaped. We also identified several kinases that work together in what is called the p38/MAPK signaling pathway . This pathway responds to and controls our body’s inflammation reaction. It is possible these kinases could be involved in the cytokine storm – a dangerous immune system overreaction – that some patients with severe COVID-19 experience.  While identifying the kinases involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication, we were also able to learn a lot about how the virus changes our bodies. For example, CK2 becomes much more active during the course of coronavirus infection and causes the growth of little tubes that extend from the surface of the cell. Under a microscope, it looks as if the cell has a full head of hair. We think SARS-CoV-2 might be using these long cell outgrowths – called filopodia – as viral highways to get new viruses closer to neighboring cells, thereby making infection easier.     Testing the promising cancer drugs in the lab was the first step, and after dozens showed promise, we began the process of starting clinical trials.  QBI UCSF , CC BY-ND    Kinases inhibitors in the lab and clinical trials  Learning more about the virus’s function is interesting for a biologist like me and could be useful down the road, but the ultimate goal of our project was to find drugs to treat COVID-19.  Once we knew which kinases SARS-CoV-2 uses to replicate and the proteins they change, we looked through a database of around 250 kinase-inhibiting drugs to see if any of them targeted the kinases used by the virus. To increase our chances, we also looked for drugs that hit some of the proteins the kinases act on. And sure enough, we found some.  There are 87 existing drugs that change the kinase-controlled pathways used by the coronavirus. Most of these drugs are already approved for human use or are currently in clinical trials to treat cancer, and could be quickly repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients.  With these leads, our collaborators in New York and Paris tested the effect of 68 of those drugs on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several of these were effective in killing the virus in cells. A few that we are especially excited about – silmitasertib, gilteritinib, ralimetinib, apilimod and dinaciclib –  are either approved for treatment, in clinical testing or under preclinical development for various diseases.  Silmitasertib stops Casein Kinase 2, the kinase that causes cells to grow the virus spreading filopodia tubes. As soon as the company that makes silmitasertib heard this news, they announced that they wanted to test the drug against COVID-19 in the clinic .  Drugs hitting kinase pathways have been on the radar of researchers as potential powerful antivirals for years, but none have come to fruition. By looking to this new area of drug applications and using our new mapping approach, our team has added dozens of drugs to the growing list of potential tools to help fight this pandemic.  It is still too early to say whether any of these will work to treat COVID-19 in patients, but the more chances we have, the better.  [ Deep knowledge, daily.

As the virus spread throughout the world this year, it reached every continent apart from Antarctica, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic. Coronavirus update: Follow all the latest news in our daily wrap. Infections have now been reported in more than 210 countries and territories. And coronavirus has now been officially ruled responsible for close to half a million deaths worldwide. The road to 10 million From a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan reported to the World Health Organisation on December 31, the virus spread fast. By January the virus began to spread throughout the country, eventually reaching all of China's 31 provinces. The country peaked with almost 6,500 new infections reported in a day in mid-February. The reproduction rate of the virus was severely curtailed by harsh lockdowns across the sprawling metropolis of Wuhan , alongside social distancing rules and increased testing. Read more about coronavirus: Why the biggest mistake Australia can make is thinking the economy is back on track because COVID-19 is under control What the is difference between community transmission and locally acquired cases, and why it matters On Sunday, China's active confirmed cases have dropped below 1,000. And while the virus has officially caused the deaths of 4,641 people in the country, since late February the vast majority of global COVID-19 cases have been elsewhere. The virus spreads outside China The first case outside China was discovered in Thailand on January 15 , before quickly spreading to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Remarkably, Thailand has only recorded 58 coronavirus deaths to date in the pandemic . But in March, Europe emerged as the virus's global epicentre. The continent reported half the world's new infections for the first time on March 5, and at its worst was detecting more than 80 per cent of the daily figures. Stay up-to-date on the coronavirus outbreak Download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest on how the pandemic is impacting the world It forced hundreds of millions of people across the continent into lockdown as governments attempted to prevent the spread of the virus. Two large clusters of the virus first overwhelmed the health system in northern Italy. But as the virus spread to other parts of the country, the Italian Government instigated regional lockdowns, making life unrecognisable from just weeks earlier . These were soon extended to a countrywide lockdown, and by the middle of March the country's new cases of coronavirus peaked.  Italy was initially the hardest hit European nation. ( AP: Luca Bruno ) For the last two months, the deaths and infection rates have slowed in Italy, and earlier this month the country reopened its borders and ended regional travel restrictions. On Saturday, there were only eight COVID-19 deaths reported in Italy, the first time the country had reported a death toll in the single digits since March 1. Although Russia has become a new hotspot, the virus seems to have reached its peak on the continent, with new confirmed cases and deaths falling in the UK, Italy, Spain and France. SARS-CoV-2 doesn't respect country borders, and by April there was a new global epicentre: the United States, which remains one of the world's most serious outbreaks to this day. By April, the virus had spread unchecked in the United States for so long that the number of confirmed cases in just that one country had eclipsed those of Europe. For more than a month, the United States alone was reporting more than a third of the world's infections. Hotspots across the developing world While most of the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 outside China was in developed countries in Europe and North America, the developing world is now feeling the brunt of the virus. Many countries in hotspots like Latin America, south Asia and Africa will be dealing with the virus for a long time to come. Coronavirus questions answered Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Read more The WHO declared South America a new epicentre in late May, and this month Brazil surpassed the United States to have the highest daily infection numbers of any country. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for his handling of the pandemic as he shuns social distancing and described it as a job-killing measure. Brazil has already recorded more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 50,000 deaths, while Peru and Chile have had more than 250,000 cases each.  Brazil now has the most recorded cases of coronavirus worldwide. ( AP: Leo Correa ) SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading at a much slower rate in Africa, but the WHO has warned the virus is being found outside capital cities, and a lack of testing capacity and supplies are hampering the response. Egypt, South Africa and Nigeria have reported the most infections in the continent, with South Africa alone accounting for a third of the more than 350,000 confirmed cases. In South Asia, India has also been hard hit by the virus, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases in the country — the fourth-most worldwide. Coronavirus isn't slowing down The rate the virus is spreading is still increasing. It took 45 days for the world to increase from two million cases to six million. It took just 28 days to climb another four million. If the virus doesn't slow down, the world will reach 20 million cases by September. True death toll expected to be much higher The true numbers of infections are likely to be far higher than the number of confirmed cases. Similarly, the true death toll is well understood to be vastly underestimated by the reported figures from each country. Globally, 5 per cent of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have died. But that has been driven up by a handful of countries with poor survival rates. In the chart below, the higher a country appears vertically, the higher the case fatality rate, and the more devastating the virus has been. The virus has impacted different countries health systems in dramatically different ways. Yemen, where the virus spread virtually undetected, has the highest case fatality rate in the world . A bigger contribution to the global fatality rate, however, are the group European countries which were affected very early in the pandemic, including Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. In part, those countries' very high fatality rates reflect that their health systems were rapidly overwhelmed by patients and did not have the capacity to treat all the serious infections. Case fatality rates also tend to be higher where a country has been unable to do enough testing to catch most infections. Australia's fatality rate is currently 1.3 per cent.

To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from nine different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high efficiency MERV-15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transmission by environmental contamination via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. More work is needed to further evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems and to verify effectiveness of building operations mitigation strategies for the protection of building occupants. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present a matter of some urgency for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high-efficiency filtration.

Who Should Not Wear a Cloth Face Covering Feasibility and Adaptations Face Shields Surgical Masks Recent Studies     CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings when around people outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.  Cloth face coverings may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.  Cloth face coverings are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.  Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.   Evidence for Effectiveness of Cloth Face Coverings   Cloth face coverings are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the cloth face covering coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of cloth face coverings is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.  Who Should Wear A Cloth Face Covering?   General public   CDC recommends all people 2 years of age and older﷟ wear a cloth face covering in public settings when around people outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to  COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to wear cloth face coverings in public settings and practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people).  While cloth face coverings are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a cloth face covering may not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible (see below for examples).    People who know or think they might have COVID-19   If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, do not visit public areas. Stay home except to get medical care. As much as possible stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If you need to be around other people or animals, wear a cloth face covering (including in your home).  The cloth face covering helps prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others. It helps keep respiratory droplets contained and from reaching other people.   Caregivers of people with COVID-19   Those caring for someone who is sick with COVID-19 at home or in a non-healthcare setting may also wear a cloth face covering. However, the protective effects—how well the cloth face covering protects healthy people from breathing in the virus—are unknown. To prevent getting sick, caregivers should also continue to practice everyday preventive actions : avoid close contact as much as possible, clean hands often; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.   Who Should Not Wear a Cloth Face Covering  Cloth face coverings should not be worn by:   Children younger than 2 years old  Anyone who has trouble breathing  Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance   Feasibility and Adaptations  CDC recognizes that wearing cloth face coverings may not be possible in every situation or for some people. In some situations, wearing a cloth face covering may exacerbate a physical or mental health condition, lead to a medical emergency, or introduce significant safety concerns. Adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a cloth face covering or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.  For example,   Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing—or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired—may be unable to wear cloth face coverings if they rely on lipreading to communicate. In this situation, consider using a clear face covering. If a clear face covering isn’t available, consider whether you can use written communication, use closed captioning, or decrease background noise to make communication possible while wearing a cloth face covering that blocks your lips.  Some individuals with developmental disabilities, sensory integration concerns or tactile sensitivities, certain mental health conditions, or limited cognitive ability may have a negative reaction to wearing a cloth face covering. These individuals may consult with their healthcare provider as part of the decision to wear a cloth face covering.  Younger children (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be unable to wear a cloth face covering properly, particularly for an extended period of time. Wearing of cloth face coverings may be prioritized at times when it is difficult to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or when standing in line at school). Ensuring proper cloth face covering size and fit and providing children with frequent reminders and education on the importance and proper wear of cloth face coverings may help address these issues.  Individuals should not wear cloth face coverings while engaged in activities that may cause the cloth face covering to become wet, like when swimming at the beach or pool . A wet cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe. For activities like swimming, it is particularly important to maintain physical distance from others when in the water.  Individuals who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a cloth face covering if it causes difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a cloth face covering, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.  Individuals who work in a setting where cloth face coverings may increase the risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns due to introduction of a hazard (for instance, straps getting caught in machinery) may consult with an occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate face covering for their setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or shift meetings, and remove face coverings when social distancing is possible. Find more information here and below.   Cloth face coverings are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. If cloth face coverings cannot be used, make sure to take other measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, including social distancing, frequent hand washing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.  Face Shields  It is not known if face shields provide any benefit as source control to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. Some people may choose to use a face shield when sustained close contact with other people is expected. If face shields are used without a mask, they should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended .  Surgical Masks  Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Cloth face coverings also are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required and available.

https://www.dailysabah.com/life/health/how-risky-are-your-everyday-activities-when-it-comes-to-coronavirus,"Most of the world, including Turkey, has started returning to more normal lifestyles with coronavirus lockdowns ending since the beginning of June. But what activities are actually safe?



Five epidemiologists and public health experts rated 11 everyday activities on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being a low-risk activity and 5 being a high-risk activity. The scientists agreed that precautions can be taken to make all of these activities safer.



""Higher-risk activities are those that are indoors, with poor ventilation and lots of people for long periods of time,"" said Ryan Malosh, a researcher at the University of Michigan. ""Lower-risk activities are outdoors, with ample space to socially distance, few people outside your household, and for shorter periods of time.""



Going to the doctor



Low risk (Average: 2.1)



Jared Baeten, University of Washington: ""People are putting off both routine and urgent health care. (But) going to a doctor right now is one of the safest places people can be going because the screening protocols for staff, waiting rooms and getting into waiting rooms are so stringent everywhere.""



Going to an outdoor picnic



Low risk (Average: 2.3)



Marybeth Sexton, Emory University: ""People (should) wear masks when not eating, bring hand sanitizer and use it before eating, maintain a 6-foot (⁓2 meter) distance from each other whenever possible, and do not share food or drinks. Anything involving closer contact or shared food, particularly anything buffet-style, would raise the risk.""



Having an outdoor playdate with a friend of your child



Low to moderate risk (Average: 2.4)



Sexton: ""If this involves older children who understand the importance of distancing during COVID, the number of children is kept small, and the activity doesn't involve direct physical contact, this is likely a 2. If this involves young children, the risk level likely rises to a 4 or 5.""



Going shopping



Low to moderate risk (Average: 2.5)



Baeten: ""If you're in and out with a good plan, wearing a mask and the people doing the service are, too.""



Returning to your office



Moderate risk (Average: 2.6)



Barun Mathema, Columbia University: ""Offices may employ alternate days to de-densify their office spaces. They could have in place things like really, really making sure that the employees are very cognizant of their symptoms, or even encouraging folks to get antibody tests.""



Visiting an elderly relative



Moderate risk (Average: 3.2)



Richard Jackson, University of California, Los Angeles: ""The risk is more to the elderly person, especially if you have not been distancing and the older adults have been distancing. And there are (psychological) benefits in this situation to young and old persons if both are well. Wear masks, wash your hands, and keep a distance.""



Baeten: ""If you haven't been in contact with anybody else and you have screened yourself for symptoms, visiting older relatives can be really beneficial. If your bubble is small, visit an older relative and maybe have the visit outside with a mask.""



Getting a haircut



Moderate risk (Average: 3.4)



Jackson: ""(If) the haircutter is well and without symptoms and is wearing a mask, and you are too, I would put it as low risk ... If the staff are sneezing and coughing, just stay away.""



In Turkey, we have seen higher-end salons be more thorough with their disinfecting and distancing practices, but that doesn't mean your small neighborhood salon is skimping on hygiene. Call ahead for an appointment, observe and, when in doubt, just postpone it a little further.



Going to a restaurant



Moderate risk (Average: 3.4)



Sexton: ""Eating outside is less risky than eating indoors because of better airflow. The risk ranges for either outdoor or indoor dining depend on who you are with (e.g. family who you are exposed to daily, versus external contacts), how close together the tables are and how many other people are present in the restaurant, and whether servers and kitchen staff are masked.""



Going to an indoor dinner party



Moderate to high risk (Average: 3.8)



Jackson: ""For adults with distancing, likely a (2), but don't let people in who might look or seem ill. It could be awkward to send people home at the door, so it would be good to make it clear while inviting. If someone has symptoms, (4).""



Sending your child to summer camp



High risk (Average: 3.9)



Jackson: ""Hikes, sports, group meals, campfires, bunkhouses, crafts, and singing are important to the camp experience and are effective ways to spread the virus. It is essential that the camp managers take cohorting, prevention and monitoring very seriously.""



Baeten: ""Camps with good things in place – small groups and mostly outside – are a 3. Camps with a lot of kids and no screening are a 4 and not a 5 only because kids have such a low risk of getting sick from this virus. But the staff are at risk.""



Riding public transit



High risk (Average: 4.1)



Jackson: ""Usually this is something people are obligated to do if they are essential workers and must earn a living, especially in urban areas. I would wear gloves, mask, and wash my hands. I know this is useless advice for people using the Lexington line in New York City, but avoid crowded subway cars. Buses should have the windows open, if possible.""",150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/health/coronavirus-dexamethasone.html,"Scientists in Britain announced a major breakthrough in the battle against the coronavirus last week, reporting they had found the first drug to reduce deaths among critically ill Covid-19 patients.



The results were first made public in a sparsely detailed news release. Now the full study, neither peer reviewed nor published yet, has been posted online, and it holds a surprise.



The drug — a cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone — does seem to help patients in dire straits, the data suggest. But it also may be risky for patients with milder illness, and the timing of the treatment is critical.



The drug “may harm some patients, and we’re not entirely sure which patients those are,” said Dr. Samuel Brown, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the research.",150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159

We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.  People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:  People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:   Chronic kidney disease  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant  Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)  Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies  Sickle cell disease  Type 2 diabetes mellitus   Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.  COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:   Asthma (moderate-to-severe)  Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)  Cystic fibrosis  Hypertension or high blood pressure  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines  Neurologic conditions, such as dementia  Liver disease  Pregnancy  Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)  Smoking  Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)  Type 1 diabetes mellitus   Want to see the evidence behind these lists?  The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.  Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19  It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.  The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:   Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.  Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.   If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.  Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.  As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities , running errands, and attending events and gatherings . There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.  People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves . Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.  In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.   If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions .  Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.  If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.   Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:  When to delay or cancel a visit   Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.  Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms .   In general,  the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread . So, think about :   How many people will you interact with?  Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?  Will you be outdoors or indoors?  What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?   Encourage social distancing during your visit   Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing .  Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.  Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.  Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.  If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.  Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.   Wear cloth face coverings   Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.  Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others  Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.    Who should NOT use cloth face coverings : Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.   Wash hands often   Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.  If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.  Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.  Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.   Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items   Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.  Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.  If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.   If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:  If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:  Lowest risk : Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.  More risk : Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).  Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.  Highest risk : Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.  Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic  Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.   It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.  Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress .   If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:   Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.  Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider , insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy.  Do not delay getting emergency care for your underlying medical condition because of COVID-19. Emergency departments have contingency infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care.  Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your underlying medical conditions or if you get sick and think that you may have COVID-19. If you need emergency help, call 911 right away.  If you don’t have a healthcare provider, contact your nearest community health center external icon or health department.

Like everyone, people with diabetes can get sick even when trying their best to prevent it. So being prepared and knowing what to do if you get sick is very important. There are several things you can do now , but also talk to your doctor about the best way to handle being sick if it happens. Visit these pages for more information:   People at High Risk for Severe COVID-19  Flu and People with Diabetes   These tips can help you take care of yourself if you get sick.   Prepare Now Before Getting Sick  Make sure you have insulin, other diabetes medicines, and easy-to-fix foods in your home, enough for several weeks or longer:   Medicines and supplies      Milk of magnesia  Medicine to control diarrhea  Antacid  Pain reliever  Thermometer  Suppositories to treat vomiting      Foods       Sports drinks  Juice boxes  Canned soup  Regular gelatin  Regular soft drinks  Instant cooked cereals  Crackers  Instant pudding  Unsweetened applesauce     If you can’t eat meals, you will need to eat or drink about 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours, such as 1½ cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1½ cup of fruit juice.   If You Get Sick  If you do get sick, your blood sugar can be hard to manage. You may not be able to eat or drink as much as usual, which can affect blood sugar levels.  Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar more often when you’re sick. That’s because when your body releases hormones to fight the illness, those hormones can also raise your blood sugar levels and increase how much insulin you need. This is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes since they depend on insulin to live.  When your body doesn’t have enough insulin, it starts breaking down fat as fuel, which produces ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can cause diabetic ketoacidosis external icon , or DKA. DKA is very serious and can cause a coma or even death .  If you think you may have DKA, use an over-the-counter kit to test your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, call your doctor right away . You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment.  Follow these additional steps when you’re sick even if your blood sugar is within your target range:   Continue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual .  Test your blood sugar every 4 hours and keep track of the results.  Drink extra calorie-free liquids*, and try to eat as you normally would.  Weigh yourself every day. Losing weight without trying is a sign of high blood glucose.  Check your temperature every morning and evening. A fever may be a sign of infection.   * Drink plenty of fluids – 4 to 6 ounces every half-hour – to prevent dehydration. You may also need to drink beverages with sugar if you cannot get 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours from other food choices. Drink small portions of these sweet beverages to keep your blood sugar from getting too high.  Go to an emergency room if any of the following occurs:  You’re having trouble breathing.  You have moderate to high ketone levels in your urine.  You can’t keep any liquids down for more than 4 hours.  You lose 5 pounds or more during the illness.  Your blood sugar is lower than 60 mg/dl.  You feel too sick to eat normally and are unable to keep down food for more than 24 hours.  You have vomiting and/or severe diarrhea for more than 6 hours.  Your temperature is over 101 degrees F for 24 hours.  You feel sleepy or can’t think clearly. Have someone else call your doctor or take you to the emergency room.

The good news is that you can prevent or delay many health complications by taking good care of yourself. That includes keeping your blood sugar levels as close to your target as possible, eating healthy, getting regular physical activity, keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol at the levels your doctor sets, taking medicines if needed, and getting regular checkups.  It sounds like a lot, but it’s worth it to improve your health and feel your best.  Heart Disease  Did you know?  Heart disease is the leading cause of death among people with diabetes. You’re twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke as someone who doesn’t have diabetes, and it could happen at a younger age.  How can diabetes affect my heart?  Over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels as well as the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. You’re also more likely to have other conditions that raise your risk for heart disease:   High blood pressure increases the force of blood through your arteries and can damage artery walls.  Too much LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in your bloodstream can build up on the damaged artery walls and form plaque. Over time, plaque can cause atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and can block the arteries, stopping blood flow to the heart (heart attack) or brain (stroke).  High triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is thought to contribute to hardening of the arteries.   None of these conditions have symptoms. Your doctor can do a simple blood test to check your levels.  How can I be “heart healthy” if I have diabetes?  These lifestyle changes can help lower your risk for heart disease:   Follow a healthy diet . Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Eat fewer processed foods (such as chips, sweets, fast food) and avoid trans pdf icon [PDF – 2 MB] fat. Drink more water, fewer sugary drinks, and less alcohol.  Aim for a healthy weight . If you’re overweight, even losing a modest amount of weight can lower your triglycerides and blood sugar. Modest weight loss means 5% to 7% of body weight, just 10 to 14 pounds for a 200-pound person.  Get physically active. Being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Try to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking.  Manage your ABCs:   A: Get a regular A 1C test to measure your average blood sugar over 2 to 3 months; aim to stay in your target range as much as possible.  B: Try to keep your b lood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets).  C: Control your c holesterol levels.  s: Stop s moking or don’t start.     Your doctor may also prescribe medicines that can help you manage your blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.

High blood sugar damages cells and blood vessels in your kidneys so they can’t filter out waste as well as they should. This condition is called chronic kidney disease, or CKD. About 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has CKD.  CKD usually gets worse over time and can lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, you’ll need regular dialysis (a treatment that filters waste out of your blood) or a kidney transplant.  How can I keep my kidneys healthy?   Stay in your target blood sugar range as much as possible, and keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the goal your doctor sets for you). Both can prevent or delay CKD and keep it from getting worse.  Make sure to take any prescribed medicines as instructed by your doctor.   CKD doesn’t have any signs or symptoms at first, so it’s important to get your kidneys checked regularly. If you do develop CKD, early treatment can help prevent other health problems. Talk to your doctor about ways you can manage CKD and take care of your kidney health.

Over time, high blood sugar can cause neuropathy (nerve damage) throughout your body. One type of neuropathy affects the nerves in your arms and legs. Symptoms can range from mild numbness to pain that makes it hard to do normal activities. The other type of neuropathy can affect your heart, stomach, and other organs in your body.  As many as half of people with diabetes have nerve problems, but not all have symptoms. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you’ll have nerve damage.  How can I prevent nerve damage?   Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.  Keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets).  Get regular physical activity.  Lose weight if you’re overweight.  Limit or avoid alcohol.  Stop smoking or don’t start.   For more information:   Diabetic Neuropathy external icon   Nerve Damage and Digestion  How can nerve damage affect my digestion?  Gastroparesis is a condition where the stomach doesn’t empty normally because of nerve damage. This can cause your blood sugar to rise when food finally leaves your stomach. Your blood sugar levels can be hard to predict and make your diabetes harder to manage. Symptoms of gastroparesis can include heartburn, nausea, vomiting, feeling full quickly, weight loss, loss of appetite, and abdominal bloating.  How can I manage gastroparesis?   Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible. High blood sugar may slow down your digestion even more.  Eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid foods high in fat (which can slow digestion further) and fiber (which may be harder to digest).  Your doctor might also prescribe medicine that helps food digest more easily and helps control nausea.   For more information:   Gastroparesis external icon   Nerve Damage, Sexual Problems, and Urinary Tract Infections  How can nerve damage cause sex and bladder problems?  Many people with nerve damage from diabetes have trouble having sex. Men can have trouble maintaining an erection and ejaculating; and women can have trouble with arousal and vaginal lubrication.  Additionally, both men and women with diabetes are more likely to get urinary tract infections and have bladder problems.  How can I prevent sex and bladder problems?   Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.  Keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets).  Ask your doctor about other options if your blood pressure medicine is causing sexual side effects.  Get regular physical activity.  Lose weight if you’re overweight.  Limit or avoid alcohol.  Stop smoking or don’t start.   For more information:   Diabetes & Sexual & Urologic Problems external icon   Top of Page Foot Health  How can diabetes affect my feet?  Nerve damage can lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold. If you don’t feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a cut, blister, or sore, or that water is too hot. Small problems can become serious if they aren’t treated early. Poor circulation (another diabetes complication) along with nerve damage puts you at risk for developing a foot ulcer (a sore or wound) that could get infected and not heal well.  If an infection doesn’t get better with treatment, your toe, foot, or part of your leg may need to be amputated (removed by surgery) to prevent the infection from spreading.  What are some ways I can take care of my feet?   Check your feet every day for cuts, redness, swelling, sores, corns, calluses, or blisters.  Wash your feet in warm—not hot—water, and dry them well.  Trim your toenails straight across and file the edges with an emery board.  Wear shoes that fit well. Break in new shoes slowly by wearing them 1 to 2 hours each day until they’re comfortable.  Never go barefoot. Always wear shoes or slippers, even inside, to protect your feet.  Put your feet up when you’re sitting and wiggle your toes for a few minutes.  Get your feet checked at every health care visit, and see your foot doctor every year (more often if you have nerve damage).

Sugar feeds the bacteria in your mouth, and when bacteria is combined with food, it creates plaque, a sticky film that can cause tooth decay.  People with diabetes are more likely to have gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss. Gum disease can also make blood sugar levels rise and make diabetes harder to manage. Treating gum disease can lower blood sugar over time and reduce the chance of other diabetes problems, such as heart disease and kidney failure.  How can I keep my mouth, teeth, and gums healthy?   Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.  Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss once a day.  If you wear dentures, remove and clean them daily. Let your dentist know if your dentures are causing any soreness.  Get regular dental checkups, and let your dentist know you have diabetes.  Stop smoking or don’t start.   Call your dentist right away if your gums are swollen and bleed easily, or if you think you may have a tooth infection.

Hearing loss is twice as common in people who have diabetes as it is in people who don’t. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage small blood vessels and nerves in the inner ear. This may also affect your balance. Hearing loss often happens gradually, so you may not know you’re having trouble hearing.  Signs you might have hearing loss include:   Problems hearing in noisy places such as busy restaurants  Thinking other people are mumbling  Often asking people to repeat themselves  Trouble following conversations with more than two people  Needing to turn the TV or radio volume up to levels that are too loud for other people   What can I do to take care of my hearing?   Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.  Get your hearing checked every year.  Avoid other causes of hearing loss, including smoking and loud noises.  Ask your doctor if any medicines you’re taking can damage your hearing and what options are available.  Ask your doctor if you need to see an audiologist (hearing loss specialist).   For more information:   Hearing Loss and Diabetes   Top of Page Vision Loss  How can diabetes affect my eyes?  Diabetic retinopathy is a very common diabetes complication, and it’s the leading cause of blindness in American adults. Over time, high blood sugar levels and high blood pressure can damage small blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eyeball). New blood vessels can develop, but they don’t grow properly and leak, causing vision loss. Usually both eyes are affected.  People with diabetes are also more likely to develop cataracts (clouding of the lens) and glaucoma (a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve).  How can I keep my eyes healthy?   Keep your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels as close to your targets as you can.  Get regular exercise.  Stop smoking or don’t start.  Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, especially dark, leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and collard greens. Eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and tuna.  Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel good.  Visit your eye doctor for a dilated eye exam at least once a year—your regular doctor won’t be able to detect eye problems. You may not even have any symptoms until you start to lose your vision, so regular eye exams are necessary. The earlier eye problems are found and treated, the better for your eyesight.   Don’t wait until your next eye appointment if you have any of these symptoms—see your eye doctor right away:   Black spots or holes in your vision  Flashes of light  Loss of side vision  Halos around lights   For more information:   Simple Tips for Healthy Eyes  Keep an Eye on Your Vision Health   Top of Page Mental Health  How are diabetes and mental health related?  Unrecognized and untreated mental health issues can make diabetes harder to handle, and the opposite is also true—getting help for a mental health problem can help you manage diabetes. But many don’t get the help they need. Problems like depression are much more common in people with diabetes, but only 25% to 50% get diagnosed and treated.  Stress is a part of life, but if you’re feeling stressed you may not take as good care of yourself and your diabetes as usual. Another very common problem is diabetes distress—feeling discouraged, frustrated, or tired of dealing with diabetes every day. That may lead you to slip into unhealthy habits, such as eating unhealthy food or skipping physical activity.  Where can I get help if I feel sad, stressed, or overwhelmed?   If you think you might have depression, get in touch with your doctor right away. The sooner you get treatment, the better for you, your quality of life, and your diabetes.  Ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health counselor who specializes in chronic health conditions.

Mohamed Azakir/Reuters            The risk of catching the coronavirus by venturing out of your house is not all or nothing. We spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky and which you should try to avoid. Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said. Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said. Visit Business Insider&apos;s homepage for more stories .    Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry. As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what&apos;s safe and what should be avoided. Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won&apos;t help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote. So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.    While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly. Here&apos;s what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country.               High risk: Gatherings of family or friends           People at a pool party.  Shutterstock/Jacob Lund    Getting together with family or friends who don&apos;t live in your household comes with a high risk of infection, Hassig said. ""If you haven&apos;t been living with them, then there&apos;s a potential risk,"" she said. Family and friends are unlikely to wear masks or social distance at these gatherings, and asymptomatic people could spread the virus there. If you do decide to get together with family or friends, you should consider the age and underlying conditions of the people there and those you live with. You should also consider who your friends could have come into contact with. Are they mostly staying at home? Are they visiting different friends every day? ""It&apos;s not just your friend"" you&apos;re seeing, Hassig said — ""it&apos;s everybody they&apos;ve spent time with.""           High risk: Bars           People toast the reopening of the Friends and Neighbors bar in Appleton, Wisconsin, following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Gov. Tony Evers' safer-at-home order on May 13.  William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS    Bars ""should not be allowed to open,"" Hassig said. The nature of bars — mingling, crowded bartops, and the inability to wear a mask while you&apos;re drinking — make them a high-risk place for getting a coronavirus infection, Hassig said. And alcohol can hinder decision-making, which could make those factors even worse.           High risk: Religious functions           People wearing face masks attend a service at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea, on May 10.  Associated Press    Rituals like shaking hands and taking communion in the Catholic Church, as well as dense crowds and the prevalence of older people, make religious services a high-risk place for coronavirus infections. The risk could be lowered by social distancing, wearing masks, and abstaining from rituals that involve touching, eating, or drinking.           High risk: Movie theaters and sporting events           A Regency Theatre.  Kevork Djansezian/Reuters    Movie theaters or large events like sporting games have a high risk especially because of the crowding at entries and exits. Even if attendees can enter and exit while social distancing — which would likely be complicated and take longer — getting infected while sitting in a contained area is still a risk.           Medium to high risk: Gyms           A person exercising at a Gold's Gym that reopened in Georgia.  Maranie Staab/Reuters    Gymgoers should wear a mask when possible, Hassig said. Equipment should be sanitized before and after each use, and social distancing should be enforced rigorously.           Medium risk: Restaurants (indoors)           Servers wearing gloves and masks get takeout orders from the kitchen at a restaurant in Houston, Texas, on May 1.  MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images    Indoor dining at restaurants is risky because of airflow and people being in an enclosed space for hours at a time. To help mitigate the risks of eating in a restaurant, people should wear masks until their food is delivered. Disposable materials, especially for things like menus, can also help.           Medium risk: Hair and nail salons           A man washes a customer's hair at a hair salon in Atlanta on April 27.  Jessica McGowan/Getty Images    Hair and nail salons, which have opened in several states, have a medium risk of infection, Hassig said. Wearing masks is critical, as it helps block particles from spreading as easily when you&apos;re speaking or coughing. It also discourages employees and customers from touching their faces. Salon employees should be sure to wash their hands frequently, Hassig said.           Medium risk: Dates or gatherings with a couple of friends           Two people eating.  David Mercado/Reuters    When it comes to dates or gatherings with a very small group, the same questions apply as with larger group gatherings. Geography also matters: In an area with a lot of cases, like New York, the risk that your date could be contagious is higher than in a suburb with only a handful of cases.           Low to medium risk: Beaches           A man rides his bike on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu in April.  Caleb Jones/AP Photo    Social distancing on beaches can help lower the risk of catching the coronavirus while you&apos;re enjoying a day in the sun. But it can also be hard to enforce because of the size of many beaches — they usually have many points of entry, so it would be difficult to limit capacity.           Low risk: Outdoor dining           A restaurant's outdoor dining area.  Sam Greenwood/Getty Images    Dining outdoors at a restaurant is a relatively low-risk activity as long as tables are kept at least 6 feet apart. Being outside allows air to flow more freely. You should still wear a mask as often as you can and be cautious of high-touch items like menus and condiments.           Low risk: Outdoor activities           A person hiking in Glacier National Park.  Galyna Andrushko/Shutterstock    When you&apos;re on a hike or a walk in the park, you shouldn&apos;t worry too much about quickly walking past another person on a path or trail. While you should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all times, encounters of more than 15 minutes are riskier than walking past someone. Outdoor activities are low risk if you stay with people from your household. If you meet up with other friends or family, that still counts as a gathering, and proper precautions should be taken.           Low risk: Shopping           A worker adjusting a sign at a Walmart.   Joe Raedle/Getty Images)     Shopping in a grocery store or a clothing store can be low risk if you keep a distance from others and wear a mask. Fitting rooms should be closed, or if people are allowed to try on clothes, anything that isn&apos;t purchased should be quarantined for a couple of days, Hassig said. The place in stores with the most risk is the checkout, where interactions with cashiers or other customers could help spread the virus.           Low risk: Touching mail or groceries           A United States Postal Service worker delivering mail in Philadelphia on April 2.  Associated Press    There&apos;s a low risk of catching the coronavirus from touching your mail or other items like groceries. Hassig said she doesn&apos;t wipe down her groceries — but if you&apos;re worried about it, you can keep nonperishable items in the grocery bag for a few days before using them. You should still be cautious about touching things like doorknobs and elevator buttons.           Something is loading.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait. The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings. One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May. Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.     'Little time for stringent measures' ""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased. Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases. They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase. Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus. But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.      A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?   IMPACT: What the virus does to the body   RECOVERY: How long does it take?   LOCKDOWN: How can we lift restrictions?   ENDGAME: How do we get out of this mess?          Media playback is unsupported on your device        Media caption Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and ""many"" scientists would wait  The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports. Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over. However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"". The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours. The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective. 'Taking a risk' However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster. Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here."" And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day. Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate. The documents also showed:  On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""  The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.  Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts  In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""  The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings  Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""  The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk  Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""  Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms  Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1  Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers. ""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence."" Follow James and Rachel on Twitter.

Policy measures to curb the coronavirus epidemic have turned the world upside down, and the true impact of this global pandemic is yet to be seen.  Researchers are still learning more about the virus every day, but how do members of the general public perceive the risks associated with COVID-19? Do these beliefs affect what people have been doing to protect themselves? As social  scientists, we’re interested in understanding how people’s beliefs and behaviors evolved in the face of this novel threat.  We launched a survey through the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study to find out. Running from March 10 through March 16, the survey covered a period of time when the information available to the public and the situation on the ground were both rapidly changing. We were able to see how people’s perceptions of risk and their actions were changing from day to day .  As this crisis continues, it is important to understand what people think about the risks and how they are behaving. If, for example, people are seeing low risks and not implementing recommended actions, then public health communications may need to address that.  Do people in the US think they’ll get COVID-19?  Theories of health behavior suggest that people who think that a risk is higher are more likely to implement protective behaviors .  Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the risks are still not fully understood by experts , much less the general public. Perhaps as a result, most of our survey respondents initially believed that their chance of getting the coronavirus was relatively low.  But over the course of our weeklong survey, reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose from 937 to 4,226 . Additionally, halfway through our survey, the government imposed multiple travel bans , barring most travelers from Europe.   As people in the U.S. learned of these events, their perceived risk of getting the coronavirus increased . To measure this, we asked people what they thought their chances were for getting the coronavirus over the next three months.  The median belief on March 10, at the beginning of our survey, was 10% – meaning half of those surveyed thought their chances were less than 10% and half thought their chances were greater.  When we closed out the survey on March 16, the median prediction had gone up to 15%. The increase suggests that people were updating their beliefs as the virus started to spread across the United States day by day. They were perhaps starting to realize that they may be more vulnerable than they’d initially thought.  When we dug deeper into our survey data, we found that not everyone was convinced that they would be getting infected with the coronavirus. The distribution was skewed to the left, with its peak at the low end of the scale. Across all of our respondents, nearly a quarter thought they had a zero or near-zero chance of getting coronavirus in the next three months. Yet, a not-insignificant number of people thought they had a very high chance of getting it. Perhaps that explains why some people were still out partying over the weekend of March 14-15 while others stayed home and committed to social distancing .   Time will tell which of these risk perceptions is correct. However, it may be overly positive to think that the chances will be zero. Psychologists have suggested that people have a tendency to underestimate their personal risks of experiencing negative events to help cope with an uncertain and scary world. This idea that “it can’t happen to me” is called unrealistic optimism and could explain the large number of people who think they face almost no risk getting the coronavirus.  This group worried us. Because risk perceptions tend to inform behaviors , people who see low risks of getting sick may not feel the need to follow recommended health behaviors like hand-washing and social distancing. Unexpectedly, this is not what we found.  What are people doing?  In our survey, we asked people whether they had engaged in behaviors to keep safe from the coronavirus, like hand-washing, canceling travel or social distancing. And to our surprise, most people said that they had already started doing these things – even if they saw relatively low chances of getting sick. By the end of the week, on March 16, nearly 89% of respondents said they were practicing social distancing, 32% higher than on the first day of the survey.   So why this seeming contradiction between belief and behavior? We think one reason could be that people felt safer as a result of implementing those actions. Doing something may have given them a feeling of control and a sense of security.  Another reason for stepping up protective actions could be that people wanted to respond to the messages to “ flatten the curve ” and to protect others – especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions.  Even in regular flu seasons, some people may be motivated to take protective actions to help others . Such altruistic motives may make people feel good about themselves, while also supporting the optimistic view that they themselves were not at risk. Engaging in those actions together with others in the community may also have further contributed to this positive outlook.  Our survey captured an interesting time of rapid change during the early days of this pandemic. It showed that there is large variation in how likely people think they are to get the coronavirus. But we also found that the vast majority of people are stepping up their protective actions – even among those that didn’t expect to get sick themselves. These findings suggest that people seem to be responding to calls to change their behavior, no matter how vulnerable – or invulnerable – they think they are.
