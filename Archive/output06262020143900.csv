1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on June 25, 2020 to reflect available data as of May 29, 2020. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.

People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:

Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy.

of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy.

1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/flu-sick-days.html,"These tips can help people with diabetes prepare for getting sick and take care of themselves if they do become ill.

Like everyone, people with diabetes can get sick even when trying their best to prevent it. So being prepared and knowing what to do if you get sick is very important. There are several things you can do now, but also talk to your doctor about the best way to handle being sick if it happens. Visit these pages for more information:

These tips can help you take care of yourself if you get sick.

Prepare Now Before Getting Sick

Make sure you have insulin, other diabetes medicines, and easy-to-fix foods in your home, enough for several weeks or longer:

Medicines and supplies

Milk of magnesia Medicine to control diarrhea Antacid Pain reliever Thermometer Suppositories to treat vomiting



Foods

Sports drinks Juice boxes Canned soup Regular gelatin Regular soft drinks Instant cooked cereals Crackers Instant pudding Unsweetened applesauce

If you can’t eat meals, you will need to eat or drink about 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours, such as 1½ cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1½ cup of fruit juice.

If You Get Sick

If you do get sick, your blood sugar can be hard to manage. You may not be able to eat or drink as much as usual, which can affect blood sugar levels.

Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar more often when you’re sick. That’s because when your body releases hormones to fight the illness, those hormones can also raise your blood sugar levels and increase how much insulin you need. This is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes since they depend on insulin to live.

When your body doesn’t have enough insulin, it starts breaking down fat as fuel, which produces ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can cause diabetic ketoacidosisexternal icon, or DKA. DKA is very serious and can cause a coma or even death.

If you think you may have DKA, use an over-the-counter kit to test your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, call your doctor right away. You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment.

Follow these additional steps when you’re sick even if your blood sugar is within your target range:

Continue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual .

. Test your blood sugar every 4 hours and keep track of the results.

Drink extra calorie-free liquids*, and try to eat as you normally would.

Weigh yourself every day. Losing weight without trying is a sign of high blood glucose.

Check your temperature every morning and evening. A fever may be a sign of infection.

*Drink plenty of fluids – 4 to 6 ounces every half-hour – to prevent dehydration. You may also need to drink beverages with sugar if you cannot get 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours from other food choices. Drink small portions of these sweet beverages to keep your blood sugar from getting too high."

Heart Disease

Did you know?

Heart disease is the leading cause of death among people with diabetes. You’re twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke as someone who doesn’t have diabetes, and it could happen at a younger age.

How can diabetes affect my heart?

Over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels as well as the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. You’re also more likely to have other conditions that raise your risk for heart disease:

High blood pressure increases the force of blood through your arteries and can damage artery walls.

increases the force of blood through your arteries and can damage artery walls. Too much LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in your bloodstream can build up on the damaged artery walls and form plaque. Over time, plaque can cause atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and can block the arteries, stopping blood flow to the heart (heart attack) or brain (stroke).

in your bloodstream can build up on the damaged artery walls and form plaque. Over time, plaque can cause atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and can block the arteries, stopping blood flow to the heart (heart attack) or brain (stroke). High triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is thought to contribute to hardening of the arteries.

None of these conditions have symptoms. Your doctor can do a simple blood test to check your levels.

How can I be “heart healthy” if I have diabetes?

These lifestyle changes can help lower your risk for heart disease:

Follow a healthy diet . Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Eat fewer processed foods (such as chips, sweets, fast food) and avoid trans pdf icon [PDF – 2 MB] fat. Drink more water, fewer sugary drinks, and less alcohol.

Being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Try to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking.

Kidney Disease

How can diabetes affect my kidneys?

High blood sugar damages cells and blood vessels in your kidneys so they can’t filter out waste as well as they should. This condition is called chronic kidney disease, or CKD. About 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has CKD.

CKD usually gets worse over time and can lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, you’ll need regular dialysis (a treatment that filters waste out of your blood) or a kidney transplant.

How can I keep my kidneys healthy?

Stay in your target blood sugar range as much as possible, and keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the goal your doctor sets for you). Both can prevent or delay CKD and keep it from getting worse.

Make sure to take any prescribed medicines as instructed by your doctor.

CKD doesn’t have any signs or symptoms at first, so it’s important to get your kidneys checked regularly. If you do develop CKD, early treatment can help prevent other health problems. Talk to your doctor about ways you can manage CKD and take care of your kidney health.

Nerve Damage

How can diabetes affect my nerves?

Over time, high blood sugar can cause neuropathy (nerve damage) throughout your body. One type of neuropathy affects the nerves in your arms and legs. Symptoms can range from mild numbness to pain that makes it hard to do normal activities. The other type of neuropathy can affect your heart, stomach, and other organs in your body.

As many as half of people with diabetes have nerve problems, but not all have symptoms. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you’ll have nerve damage.

How can I prevent nerve damage?

Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.

Keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets).

Get regular physical activity.

Lose weight if you’re overweight.

Limit or avoid alcohol.

Stop smoking or don’t start.

Nerve Damage and Digestion

How can nerve damage affect my digestion?

Gastroparesis is a condition where the stomach doesn’t empty normally because of nerve damage. This can cause your blood sugar to rise when food finally leaves your stomach. Your blood sugar levels can be hard to predict and make your diabetes harder to manage. Symptoms of gastroparesis can include heartburn, nausea, vomiting, feeling full quickly, weight loss, loss of appetite, and abdominal bloating.

How can I manage gastroparesis?

Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible. High blood sugar may slow down your digestion even more.

Eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid foods high in fat (which can slow digestion further) and fiber (which may be harder to digest).

Your doctor might also prescribe medicine that helps food digest more easily and helps control nausea.

Nerve Damage, Sexual Problems, and Urinary Tract Infections

How can nerve damage cause sex and bladder problems?

Many people with nerve damage from diabetes have trouble having sex. Men can have trouble maintaining an erection and ejaculating; and women can have trouble with arousal and vaginal lubrication.

Additionally, both men and women with diabetes are more likely to get urinary tract infections and have bladder problems.

How can I prevent sex and bladder problems?

Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.

Keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets).

Ask your doctor about other options if your blood pressure medicine is causing sexual side effects.

Get regular physical activity.

Lose weight if you’re overweight.

Limit or avoid alcohol.

Stop smoking or don’t start.

Foot Health

How can diabetes affect my feet?

Nerve damage can lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold. If you don’t feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a cut, blister, or sore, or that water is too hot. Small problems can become serious if they aren’t treated early. Poor circulation (another diabetes complication) along with nerve damage puts you at risk for developing a foot ulcer (a sore or wound) that could get infected and not heal well.

If an infection doesn’t get better with treatment, your toe, foot, or part of your leg may need to be amputated (removed by surgery) to prevent the infection from spreading.

What are some ways I can take care of my feet?

Check your feet every day for cuts, redness, swelling, sores, corns, calluses, or blisters.

Wash your feet in warm—not hot—water, and dry them well.

Trim your toenails straight across and file the edges with an emery board.

Wear shoes that fit well. Break in new shoes slowly by wearing them 1 to 2 hours each day until they’re comfortable.

Never go barefoot. Always wear shoes or slippers, even inside, to protect your feet.

Put your feet up when you’re sitting and wiggle your toes for a few minutes.

Get your feet checked at every health care visit, and see your foot doctor every year (more often if you have nerve damage).

Oral Health

How can diabetes affect my mouth, teeth, and gums?

High blood sugar increases the level of sugar in your saliva. Sugar feeds the bacteria in your mouth, and when bacteria is combined with food, it creates plaque, a sticky film that can cause tooth decay.

People with diabetes are more likely to have gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss. Gum disease can also make blood sugar levels rise and make diabetes harder to manage. Treating gum disease can lower blood sugar over time and reduce the chance of other diabetes problems, such as heart disease and kidney failure.

How can I keep my mouth, teeth, and gums healthy?

Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.

Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss once a day.

If you wear dentures, remove and clean them daily. Let your dentist know if your dentures are causing any soreness.

Get regular dental checkups, and let your dentist know you have diabetes.

Stop smoking or don’t start.

Call your dentist right away if your gums are swollen and bleed easily, or if you think you may have a tooth infection.

Hearing Loss

How can diabetes affect my hearing?

Hearing loss is twice as common in people who have diabetes as it is in people who don’t. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage small blood vessels and nerves in the inner ear. This may also affect your balance. Hearing loss often happens gradually, so you may not know you’re having trouble hearing.

Signs you might have hearing loss include:

Problems hearing in noisy places such as busy restaurants

Thinking other people are mumbling

Often asking people to repeat themselves

Trouble following conversations with more than two people

Needing to turn the TV or radio volume up to levels that are too loud for other people

What can I do to take care of my hearing?

Keep your blood sugar as close to your target levels as possible.

Get your hearing checked every year.

Avoid other causes of hearing loss, including smoking and loud noises.

Ask your doctor if any medicines you’re taking can damage your hearing and what options are available.

Ask your doctor if you need to see an audiologist (hearing loss specialist).

Vision Loss

How can diabetes affect my eyes?

Diabetic retinopathy is a very common diabetes complication, and it’s the leading cause of blindness in American adults. Over time, high blood sugar levels and high blood pressure can damage small blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eyeball). New blood vessels can develop, but they don’t grow properly and leak, causing vision loss. Usually both eyes are affected.

People with diabetes are also more likely to develop cataracts (clouding of the lens) and glaucoma (a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve).

How can I keep my eyes healthy?

Keep your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels as close to your targets as you can.

Get regular exercise.

Stop smoking or don’t start.

Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, especially dark, leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and collard greens. Eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and tuna.

Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel good.

Visit your eye doctor for a dilated eye exam at least once a year—your regular doctor won’t be able to detect eye problems. You may not even have any symptoms until you start to lose your vision, so regular eye exams are necessary. The earlier eye problems are found and treated, the better for your eyesight.

Don’t wait until your next eye appointment if you have any of these symptoms—see your eye doctor right away:

Black spots or holes in your vision

Flashes of light

Loss of side vision

Halos around lights

Mental Health

How are diabetes and mental health related?

Unrecognized and untreated mental health issues can make diabetes harder to handle, and the opposite is also true—getting help for a mental health problem can help you manage diabetes. But many don’t get the help they need. Problems like depression are much more common in people with diabetes, but only 25% to 50% get diagnosed and treated.

Stress is a part of life, but if you’re feeling stressed you may not take as good care of yourself and your diabetes as usual. Another very common problem is diabetes distress—feeling discouraged, frustrated, or tired of dealing with diabetes every day. That may lead you to slip into unhealthy habits, such as eating unhealthy food or skipping physical activity.

Where can I get help if I feel sad, stressed, or overwhelmed?

If you think you might have depression, get in touch with your doctor right away. The sooner you get treatment, the better for you, your quality of life, and your diabetes.

Ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health counselor who specializes in chronic health conditions.

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:"
1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),9,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/asthma.html,"This information is based on what we currently know about the spread and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19

People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.

Treatment

There is currently no specific treatment for or vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.

Prepare for COVID-19

Stock up on supplies.

Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others.

When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick.

Clean your hands often by washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid crowds and people who are sick.

Avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.

During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.

If someone in your home is sick, have them stay away from the rest of the household to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in your home.

Avoid sharing personal household items such as cups and towels.

Follow your Asthma Action Plan

Keep your asthma under control by following your asthma action plan.

Continue your current medications, including any inhalers with steroids in them (“steroids” is another word for corticosteroids).

Don’t stop any medications or change your asthma treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

Discuss any concerns about your treatment with your healthcare provider.

Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications, such as asthma inhalers. Make sure that you have 30 days of non-prescription medications and supplies on hand too in case you need to stay home for a long time.

Know how to use your inhaler.

Avoid your asthma triggers.

As more cases of COVID-19 are discovered and our communities take action to combat the spread of disease, it is natural for some people to feel concerned or stressed. Strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack. Take steps to help yourself cope with stress and anxiety.

For information on administering asthma medication in schools, visit K-12 Schools and Child Care Programs.

Clean and disinfect things you or your family touch frequently

If possible, have someone who doesn’t have asthma do the cleaning and disinfecting. When they use cleaning and disinfecting products, have them: Make sure that people with asthma are not in the room. Minimize use of disinfectants that can cause an asthma attack. Open windows or doors and use a fan that blows air outdoors. Clean and disinfect surfaces like phones, remotes, tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks daily. Always follow the instructions on the product label. Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows).

Relaxing lockdown is a risk because levels of the coronavirus are still ""very high"", one of the government's top science advisers says.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait.

The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings.

One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.

'Little time for stringent measures'

""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.

Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases.

They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase.

Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus.

But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.

The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports.

Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over.

However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"".

The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick.

This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Patrick Vallance heads up Sage, the body which provides scientific advice to government

Behavioural scientists advising government ""strongly recommend"" monitoring how well people were keeping to the rules.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours.

The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective.

'Taking a risk'

However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster.

Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here.""

And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day.

Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate.

The documents also showed:

On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""

The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.

Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts

In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""

The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings

Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""

The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk

Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""

Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms

Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1

Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.

""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence.""

Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said.

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.

While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly.

Our collective patience with the coronavirus is growing thin.

But, ""the pandemic is not over, and it's important to recognize that,"" Butler said.

As restaurants, bars, hair salons, as well as many homes and offices continue opening up again, it's good to remember that some activities are still far more risky than others when it comes to contracting the illness caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19.

""Here's a general rule of thumb: the more closely you interact with others, the longer the interaction lasts, and the greater the number of people involved in the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread,"" Butler said.

Good handwashing practices, especially before eating or touching your face, keeping a safe distance from others when possible, and using face masks or shields when out in public are all still good practices to maintain. It's also prudent to avoid long visits to crowded spaces.

""This virus likes the possibility of close quarters,"" epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead for COVID-19, said during a regular press briefing on June 22.

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://theconversation.com/americans-disagree-on-how-risky-the-coronavirus-is-but-most-are-changing-their-behavior-anyway-133991,"As the coronavirus began to spread in the United States, people faced an unknown risk and evolving health recommendations. Policy measures to curb the coronavirus epidemic have turned the world upside down, and the true impact of this global pandemic is yet to be seen.

Researchers are still learning more about the virus every day, but how do members of the general public perceive the risks associated with COVID-19? Do these beliefs affect what people have been doing to protect themselves? As social scientists, we’re interested in understanding how people’s beliefs and behaviors evolved in the face of this novel threat.

We launched a survey through the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study to find out. Running from March 10 through March 16, the survey covered a period of time when the information available to the public and the situation on the ground were both rapidly changing. We were able to see how people’s perceptions of risk and their actions were changing from day to day.

As this crisis continues, it is important to understand what people think about the risks and how they are behaving. If, for example, people are seeing low risks and not implementing recommended actions, then public health communications may need to address that.

Do people in the US think they’ll get COVID-19?

Theories of health behavior suggest that people who think that a risk is higher are more likely to implement protective behaviors.

Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the risks are still not fully understood by experts, much less the general public. Perhaps as a result, most of our survey respondents initially believed that their chance of getting the coronavirus was relatively low.

But over the course of our weeklong survey, reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose from 937 to 4,226. Additionally, halfway through our survey, the government imposed multiple travel bans, barring most travelers from Europe.

As people in the U.S. learned of these events, their perceived risk of getting the coronavirus increased. To measure this, we asked people what they thought their chances were for getting the coronavirus over the next three months.

The median belief on March 10, at the beginning of our survey, was 10% – meaning half of those surveyed thought their chances were less than 10% and half thought their chances were greater.

When we closed out the survey on March 16, the median prediction had gone up to 15%. The increase suggests that people were updating their beliefs as the virus started to spread across the United States day by day. They were perhaps starting to realize that they may be more vulnerable than they’d initially thought.

When we dug deeper into our survey data, we found that not everyone was convinced that they would be getting infected with the coronavirus. The distribution was skewed to the left, with its peak at the low end of the scale. Across all of our respondents, nearly a quarter thought they had a zero or near-zero chance of getting coronavirus in the next three months. Yet, a not-insignificant number of people thought they had a very high chance of getting it. Perhaps that explains why some people were still out partying over the weekend of March 14-15 while others stayed home and committed to social distancing.

Time will tell which of these risk perceptions is correct. However, it may be overly positive to think that the chances will be zero. Psychologists have suggested that people have a tendency to underestimate their personal risks of experiencing negative events to help cope with an uncertain and scary world. This idea that “it can’t happen to me” is called unrealistic optimism and could explain the large number of people who think they face almost no risk getting the coronavirus.

This group worried us. Because risk perceptions tend to inform behaviors, people who see low risks of getting sick may not feel the need to follow recommended health behaviors like hand-washing and social distancing. Unexpectedly, this is not what we found.

What are people doing?

In our survey, we asked people whether they had engaged in behaviors to keep safe from the coronavirus, like hand-washing, canceling travel or social distancing. And to our surprise, most people said that they had already started doing these things – even if they saw relatively low chances of getting sick. By the end of the week, on March 16, nearly 89% of respondents said they were practicing social distancing, 32% higher than on the first day of the survey.

So why this seeming contradiction between belief and behavior? We think one reason could be that people felt safer as a result of implementing those actions. Doing something may have given them a feeling of control and a sense of security.

Another reason for stepping up protective actions could be that people wanted to respond to the messages to “flatten the curve” and to protect others – especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions.

Even in regular flu seasons, some people may be motivated to take protective actions to help others. Such altruistic motives may make people feel good about themselves, while also supporting the optimistic view that they themselves were not at risk. Engaging in those actions together with others in the community may also have further contributed to this positive outlook.

Our survey captured an interesting time of rapid change during the early days of this pandemic. It showed that there is large variation in how likely people think they are to get the coronavirus. But we also found that the vast majority of people are stepping up their protective actions – even among those that didn’t expect to get sick themselves. These findings suggest that people seem to be responding to calls to change their behavior, no matter how vulnerable – or invulnerable – they think they are.

The drug — a cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone — does seem to help patients in dire straits, the data suggest. But it also may be risky for patients with milder illness, and the timing of the treatment is critical.

The drug “may harm some patients, and we’re not entirely sure which patients those are,” said Dr. Samuel Brown, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the research."

Should we still wear masks outside? (Some areas don’t require it, while Virginia just made them mandatory for all public indoor spaces.)

Is it risky to get a haircut? (Several states have reopened salons, while others deem them still too dangerous.)

And can we visit friends and relatives?

It’s not yet clear where Americans stand on these questions as they begin to venture out of quarantine. So over Memorial Day weekend, in partnership with Morning Consult, POLITICO asked nearly 2,000 Americans to rate the relative risk of a dozen common activities from 1 to 10. Then, we asked a panel of 18 public health experts to give their professional opinion.

The survey provides a snapshot of where Americans see the most danger — and where they’re most out of sync with experts.

Let’s first ask the most important respondent of all: You. Here’s a scenario that was especially relevant last weekend:

How risky is it for the average person to attend an outdoor barbecue with about 20 people? No risk

at all You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A great deal

of risk No risk

at all A great deal

of risk Submit U.S. 6.5 Experts 7.0 Takeaway You rated this activity as less risky than both the average American and our expert panel did.

On this question and several others, expert opinion lined up with what Americans already think.

“My first reaction was that there’s remarkable consistency,” said Elizabeth Stuart, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who consulted with POLITICO in creating the survey. “It’s reassuring, at a broad level, that people are getting the public health messages and are able to distinguish between relatively lower risk and higher risk.”

Other situations were a bit thornier. Here’s another scenario:

How risky is it for the average person to run outside without a mask? No risk

at all You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A great deal

of risk No risk

at all A great deal

of risk Submit U.S. 4.3 Experts 2.9 Takeaway You rated this activity as more risky than both the average American and our expert panel did.

In this case, Americans rated the risk of running outside much higher than the experts did, even though both graded it as one of the least risky activities on the list.

In general, POLITICO found a few consistent patterns:

Americans are more likely to view activities as risky than experts: In eight of 11 scenarios, poll respondents gave a higher risk rating than the expert panel.

There’s a big gap between Democrats and Republicans. On average, Republican respondents rated activities’ risk more than a point lower than Democrats. We saw a similar pattern between men and women, with men finding most activities less risky.

Some questions had a wide range of responses, even among experts. Some scenarios were cut-and-dried — nearly everyone agrees it’s quite risky to go to a baseball game in a stadium, for instance. But the experts struggled to find consensus on others. For instance, our panelists rated the risk of using a public bathroom from 2 to 10, though most responses were on the lower end of the scale. “Different people have different risk tolerances,” Stuart said. And of course, the same survey question can conjure different mental images. “People might be imagining different scenarios in their head.”

Here’s the full list of what we asked, and how the average American’s response compared to the experts’:

Let’s run through each question. On the charts below, we’ve plotted the average riskiness score from our poll respondents and panelists, breaking out answers from Republican and Democratic respondents alongside the overall U.S. average.

We’ll start with the questions that had the biggest gap between experts and everyday people.

Running outside with a mask No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 1.8 U.S. avg 3.5 Dem avg 3.9 GOP avg 3.1 Running outside without a mask No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 2.9 U.S. avg 4.3 Dem avg 5.0 GOP avg 3.8 As mentioned above, Americans generally found outdoor running more risky than the experts did, regardless of whether a mask is worn. “If you’re running outside, especially with a mask on, but even without a mask on, if you are in a spot where you can stay distant from others — it’s really pretty low risk,” Stuart said. Using a public bathroom with multiple stalls No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 5.2 U.S. avg 6.7 Dem avg 7.3 GOP avg 6.2 Both Democrats and Republicans rated this more risky than the experts did.

Our experts noted that brief, controlled contact with others may be less risky than perceived, especially if proper distance is maintained and both parties wear masks. How easily Covid-19 is spread via surfaces — like the handle of a utility closet, for instance — is still being studied. The CDC recently cautioned that contaminated surfaces remain a risk, though they’re likely not the main way the virus spreads.

Both experts and Americans gave this activity middling scores, though polling respondents were a bit more conservative.

Whether or not it’s safe to get a haircut — with or without a mask — had one of the higher partisan gaps on our survey. Our expert panel didn’t agree on this one either, with risk tallies for the “masked” version of our question ranging from 2 to 8. (They were more united on getting a haircut without wearing a mask.) Giving a hug to someone who’s not a member of your household No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 6.8 U.S. avg 6.9 Dem avg 7.6 GOP avg 6.3 Hugging another person not from your household breaks one of the cardinal rules of social distancing — maintaining six feet distance. While both experts and Americans ended up with roughly the same average rating, there was a spread of opinions in both camps. It could come down to how you hug, Stuart said. “There’s increasing evidence the really high-risk interactions are when you’re in an enclosed space for more than 15 minutes with someone who is infected,” she said. “So a hug where you have masks on and wash your hands after — that might be where some of the lower-risk votes are coming from.” Attending an outdoor barbecue with about 20 people No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 7.0 U.S. avg 6.5 Dem avg 7.4 GOP avg 5.7 This question had the widest gap between Democrats and Republicans of our survey, with experts falling in between. On the plus side, it’s an outdoor activity, with less opportunity for droplets from an infected person to circulate. But crowds are still inadvisable, and so is shared food. Going to another family's home for dinner No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 6.5 U.S. avg 5.6 Dem avg 6.3 GOP avg 4.9 Both Democrats and Republicans underestimate the risk of visiting another family for dinner compared to experts, the survey showed. Attending a baseball game at a stadium No risk at all A great deal of risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Experts 8.6 U.S. avg 7.7 Dem avg 8.5 GOP avg 6.8 Our expert panel was united on this scenario — going to a baseball stadium is a bad idea. Crowds, tight spaces and lines at concession stands do not mix well with social distancing. “It’s really hard to maintain a six-foot distance when you’re walking to your seat,” Stuart said. While everyone rated this as the most dangerous scenario on our list, Republicans rated it less risky than Democrats and our expert panel did.

Methodology Morning Consult polled 1,986 registered U.S. voters between May 22-26. For each of the activities above, poll respondents were given the following prompt: “As the U.S. begins to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic, please rate the riskiness of each activity to the average person’s health, with 1 meaning there’s no risk at all, 5 meaning there’s a moderate amount of risk, and 10 meaning there’s a great deal of risk.” For questions involving masks, half of those surveyed received questions specifying masks would be worn, while the other half had questions specifying masks wouldn’t be worn. (Our expert panel received both sets of questions.) Margin of error is +/- 2%."

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),9,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/online-covid-19-dashboard-calculates-how-risky-reopenings-and-gatherings-can-be/,"On March 11, 2020, the NBA suspended its season after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19. Within a week, March Madness was canceled, and soon after that, many states began to issue stay-at-home orders that have lasted for weeks if not months. Super-spreading events (the Biogen conference, a Washington state choir practice and a post-funeral gathering in southwest Georgia, for example) made it evident that halting gatherings would be an essential part of ongoing public health interventions in the United States and elsewhere.

Now, more than two months later, many states, including Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin, Maryland and others, are beginning to reopen their economies by relaxing previously stringent lockdown policies. These changes shift the dilemma of deciding where and how to venture out from statewide policy onto individuals. For many, the opportunity for a slice of normalcy seems like welcome relief.

But the reality is that the risk of COVID-19 has not passed. Far from it. In the two weeks preceding this essay’s publication, there were more than 300,000 new positive cases, there were 300,000 new positive cases of COVID-19 reported (for more details see the COVID Tracking Web site). These new cases are almost certainly a significant underestimate of the number of new cases in the U.S., impacted by undertesting, reporting lags and challenges in identifying mild or asymptomatic cases. Variation in case trajectories makes it hard to figure out: what is the risk of going out to dinner, really?

Our team of interdisciplinary researchers from Georgia Tech, Stanford University, and the Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory has developed an online dashboard, called the COVID-19 Risk Assessment Planning Tool, to help individuals make informed decisions about risk and take preventive steps to reduce transmission. This risk assessment planner provides an estimate that answers the following question: what is the chance that one (or more) individuals is infected with COVID-19 in a group of a given size?

In order to figure this out, we must ask a different question: what is the chance that no one is infected? If we knew the probability p that an individual was infected, then the probability that person is not infected is (1–p). The probability that no one is infected in a group of size n (whether n is 10, 25, 100, 250 or so on) is equivalent to tossing a biased coin n times, with odds (1–p) to come out heads, each and every time, or (1–p)n. By extension, if even one coin-flip comes out tails, that implies that someone might transmit COVID-19. Hence, the probability that one or more individuals is infectious in a group of size n, given a per-person probability p of being infectious is: 1–(1–p)n.

In order to estimate the per-person probability at the state level, we use the past two weeks of reported cases as an estimate of the number of potentially active circulating infections in a given state or the entire U.S. The mean infectious period for COVID-19 is approximately one week, but we have included a conservative bound on circulating cases given variability in the onset of infectiousness and associated viral shedding..

Hence, if there are 50,000 new cases in a state of 10 million, the per-person probability is 0.5 percent. That seems quite small. But, the probability that at least one individual is infected with COVID-19 goes up rapidly with group size. In this example, there’s a 4.9 percent chance that one or more people in a dinner party for 10 would be infected, a 22 percent chance that one or more people in a restaurant with 50 would be infected, a 71 percent chance that that one or more people in a dance club for 250 would be infected, and over a 99 percent chance that one or more people in a concert or sports event for 1,000 would be infected.

In other words: small risks for individuals rapidly become large risks when viewed collectively.

Our estimates incorporate considerable uncertainty because we don’t know exactly how many people are currently infectious. “Silent spreaders” are responsible for a significant fraction of infectious transmission but may never get diagnosed or reported as cases. Additional reporting lags and limited testing capacity may mean a substantial fraction of cases remain undetected.

The dashboard accounts for the ascertainment bias by multiplying the estimated circulating cases by a factor of five, 10 or 20, in range with recent estimates of ascertainment bias arrived at from serological surveys. These serological surveys provide a means to estimate who has been sick rather than who is sick, providing an independent check on the extent to which we have missed cases. These parameters can be varied in the dashboard, recognizing the significant uncertainty and heterogeneity involved in these types of estimates.

Our hope is that being more aware of one’s risk can help individuals take precautions. Just as a weather forecast tells you whether it’s going to rain allowing you to reduce your risk of getting wet, there are ways to reduce one’s risk of being infected or of unwittingly infecting others. Mask-wearing, social distancing, interacting outdoors at distance for shorter periods (rather than indoors in close proximity for longer periods), handwashing and monitoring for symptoms (including unusual symptoms like loss of smell/taste) may reduce risks of transmission.

It is critical to keep in mind that the risks of being near someone with COVID-19 are almost certainly higher now than they were two months ago in most parts of the U.S. The COVID-19 risk assessment planner includes daily updates of risk at state levels and is a reminder that we need more testing at scale, both to stay informed and also to help stop chains of transmission before they start. The vast majority of us remain susceptible to infection, and we remain at risk in the absence of a safe, effective vaccine.

When deciding if and how to go out, it is critical to remember that, while we may be worried about someone else in a crowd putting us at risk, that someone in the crowd might just be us. Our empathy (and a bit of understanding of the mathematics of risk) may very well save lives.
