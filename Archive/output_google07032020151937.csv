1,it is (more risky|riskier) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/how-risky-flying-during-coronavirus-pandemic,"WASHINGTON - How risky is flying during the coronavirus pandemic?



Flying can increase your risk of exposure to infection, but airlines are taking some precautions and you can too.



Air travel means spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which puts you into close contact with other people. As travel slowly recovers, planes are becoming more crowded, which means you will likely sit close to other people, often for hours, which raises your risk.



Once on a plane, most viruses and other germs don't spread easily because of the way air circulates, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Airlines also say they are focusing on sanitizing the hard surfaces that passengers commonly touch.



Some airlines like Alaska, Delta, JetBlue and Southwest are blocking middle seats or limiting capacity. But even if every middle seat is empty you will likely be closer than the recommended distance of 6 feet to another passenger now that planes are getting fuller.



American, United and Spirit are now booking flights to full capacity when they can. All leading U.S. airlines require passengers to wear masks. Lauren Ancel Meyers, an expert in disease outbreaks at the University of Texas, says that can help limit risk.



For air travel, and all other types of transportation, the CDC recommends washing your hands, maintaining social distancing and wearing face coverings.



Several airlines announced Monday that they will ask passengers about possible COVID-19 symptoms and whether they have been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus in the previous two weeks.



Still, Meyers said you still might consider whether you need to be on that plane. ""We should all be in the mindset of 'only if necessary' and always taking the most precautions we can to protect ourselves and others,"" she said.","        Skip to main content           Open main navigation           Live TV            Full Schedule   All Programs          Live Radio                 Full Schedule   All Programs          United States      US Politics    Immigration    All About America      Science & Health    Silicon Valley & Technology        World      Africa    The Americas    East Asia Pacific    Europe      Extremism Watch    Middle East    South & Central Asia    VOA News on Iran        Sections      Arts & Culture    Day in Photos    Economy & Business    Press Freedom      Plugged in with Greta Van Susteren    VOA StudentU    VOA Connect    Refugees              FEATURED  US News  Press Freedom  VOA News on Iran  COVID-19 Pandemic  Editorials          Search       Search VOA News     Search         Lang     Live TV           Live TV            Full Schedule   All Programs          Live Radio          Live Radio                 Full Schedule   All Programs                  English   English  voanews.com    Learning English  learningenglish.voanews.com     Eastern & Central Europe   Shqip  zeriamerikes.com    Bosanski  ba.voanews.com    Ελληνικά  gr.voanews.com    Македонски  mk.voanews.com    Srpski  glasamerike.net    Українська  ukrainian.voanews.com     Eurasia   Հայերեն  amerikayidzayn.com    Azerbaijani  amerikaninsesi.org    ქართული  amerikiskhma.com    Русский  golos-ameriki.ru     Central Asia   O‘zbek‎  amerikaovozi.com     South Asia   বাংলা  voabangla.com    دری  darivoa.com    پښتو  pashtovoa.com    وی او اې ډيوه ريډیو  voadeewanews.com    ارد  urduvoa.com     East & Southeast Asia   ျမန္မာ  burmese.voanews.com    粤语  voacantonese.com    中文  voachinese.com    Bahasa Indonesia  voaindonesia.com    ខ្មែរ  khmer.voanews.com    Khmer  voacambodia.com    한국어  voakorea.com    ລາວ  lao.voanews.com    ไทย  voathai.com    བོད་ཡིག  voatibetan.com    Tiếng Việt  voatiengviet.com     Africa   Afaan Oromoo  voaafaanoromoo.com    አማርኛ  amharic.voanews.com    Bambara  voabambara.com    Français  voaafrique.com    Hausa  voahausa.com    Kinyarwanda / Kirundi  radiyoyacuvoa.com    Ndebele  voandebele.com    Português  voaportugues.com    Shona  voashona.com    Soomaaliga  voasomali.com    Kiswahili  voaswahili.com    ትግርኛ  tigrigna.voanews.com    Zimbabwe  voazimbabwe.com     Middle East/North Africa   فارسی  ir.voanews.com    كوردی  dengiamerika.com    Kurdi  dengeamerika.com    Türkçe  amerikaninsesi.com     Latin America   Creole  voanouvel.com    Español  voanoticias.com                Share on Facebook    Share on Twitter    Share via Email    Print this page       COVID-19 Pandemic  How Risky Is Flying During Coronavirus Pandemic?

We spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky and which you should try to avoid.

Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said.

Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said.

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.

While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly.

Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly. Here&apos;s what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country.               High risk: Gatherings of family or friends           People at a pool party.  Shutterstock/Jacob Lund    Getting together with family or friends who don&apos;t live in your household comes with a high risk of infection, Hassig said. ""If you haven&apos;t been living with them, then there&apos;s a potential risk,"" she said. Family and friends are unlikely to wear masks or social distance at these gatherings, and asymptomatic people could spread the virus there. If you do decide to get together with family or friends, you should consider the age and underlying conditions of the people there and those you live with. You should also consider who your friends could have come into contact with. Are they mostly staying at home? Are they visiting different friends every day? ""It&apos;s not just your friend"" you&apos;re seeing, Hassig said — ""it&apos;s everybody they&apos;ve spent time with.""           High risk: Bars           People toast the reopening of the Friends and Neighbors bar in Appleton, Wisconsin, following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Gov. Tony Evers' safer-at-home order on May 13.  William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS    Bars ""should not be allowed to open,"" Hassig said. The nature of bars — mingling, crowded bartops, and the inability to wear a mask while you&apos;re drinking — make them a high-risk place for getting a coronavirus infection, Hassig said. And alcohol can hinder decision-making, which could make those factors even worse.           High risk: Religious functions           People wearing face masks attend a service at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea, on May 10.  Associated Press    Rituals like shaking hands and taking communion in the Catholic Church, as well as dense crowds and the prevalence of older people, make religious services a high-risk place for coronavirus infections. The risk could be lowered by social distancing, wearing masks, and abstaining from rituals that involve touching, eating, or drinking.           High risk: Movie theaters and sporting events           A Regency Theatre.  Kevork Djansezian/Reuters    Movie theaters or large events like sporting games have a high risk especially because of the crowding at entries and exits. Even if attendees can enter and exit while social distancing — which would likely be complicated and take longer — getting infected while sitting in a contained area is still a risk.           Medium to high risk: Gyms           A person exercising at a Gold's Gym that reopened in Georgia.  Maranie Staab/Reuters    Gymgoers should wear a mask when possible, Hassig said. Equipment should be sanitized before and after each use, and social distancing should be enforced rigorously.           Medium risk: Restaurants (indoors)           Servers wearing gloves and masks get takeout orders from the kitchen at a restaurant in Houston, Texas, on May 1.  MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images    Indoor dining at restaurants is risky because of airflow and people being in an enclosed space for hours at a time. To help mitigate the risks of eating in a restaurant, people should wear masks until their food is delivered. Disposable materials, especially for things like menus, can also help.           Medium risk: Hair and nail salons           A man washes a customer's hair at a hair salon in Atlanta on April 27.  Jessica McGowan/Getty Images    Hair and nail salons, which have opened in several states, have a medium risk of infection, Hassig said. Wearing masks is critical, as it helps block particles from spreading as easily when you&apos;re speaking or coughing. It also discourages employees and customers from touching their faces. Salon employees should be sure to wash their hands frequently, Hassig said.           Medium risk: Dates or gatherings with a couple of friends           Two people eating.  David Mercado/Reuters    When it comes to dates or gatherings with a very small group, the same questions apply as with larger group gatherings. Geography also matters: In an area with a lot of cases, like New York, the risk that your date could be contagious is higher than in a suburb with only a handful of cases.           Low to medium risk: Beaches           A man rides his bike on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu in April.  Caleb Jones/AP Photo    Social distancing on beaches can help lower the risk of catching the coronavirus while you&apos;re enjoying a day in the sun. But it can also be hard to enforce because of the size of many beaches — they usually have many points of entry, so it would be difficult to limit capacity.           Low risk: Outdoor dining           A restaurant's outdoor dining area.  Sam Greenwood/Getty Images    Dining outdoors at a restaurant is a relatively low-risk activity as long as tables are kept at least 6 feet apart. Being outside allows air to flow more freely. You should still wear a mask as often as you can and be cautious of high-touch items like menus and condiments.           Low risk: Outdoor activities           A person hiking in Glacier National Park.  Galyna Andrushko/Shutterstock    When you&apos;re on a hike or a walk in the park, you shouldn&apos;t worry too much about quickly walking past another person on a path or trail. While you should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all times, encounters of more than 15 minutes are riskier than walking past someone. Outdoor activities are low risk if you stay with people from your household. If you meet up with other friends or family, that still counts as a gathering, and proper precautions should be taken.           Low risk: Shopping           A worker adjusting a sign at a Walmart.   Joe Raedle/Getty Images)     Shopping in a grocery store or a clothing store can be low risk if you keep a distance from others and wear a mask. Fitting rooms should be closed, or if people are allowed to try on clothes, anything that isn&apos;t purchased should be quarantined for a couple of days, Hassig said. The place in stores with the most risk is the checkout, where interactions with cashiers or other customers could help spread the virus.           Low risk: Touching mail or groceries           A United States Postal Service worker delivering mail in Philadelphia on April 2.  Associated Press    There&apos;s a low risk of catching the coronavirus from touching your mail or other items like groceries. Hassig said she doesn&apos;t wipe down her groceries — but if you&apos;re worried about it, you can keep nonperishable items in the grocery bag for a few days before using them. You should still be cautious about touching things like doorknobs and elevator buttons.           Something is loading.

Since 31 December 2019 and as of 9 June 2020, 7 069 278 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including 405 587 deaths. EU/EEA countries and the UK reported 1 444 710 cases (20% of all cases), including 169 207 deaths (42% of all deaths).

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to EU/EEA countries and the UK and to countries worldwide, many of which have been experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several months. While decreasing trends in disease incidence are being observed in the EU/EEA and the UK overall, some Member States are still reporting community transmission. In addition, the information available from sero-epidemiological studies suggests that the adaptive immunity of populations remains low.

The absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, combined with an exponential growth in infections from late February, led many countries to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as ‘stay-at-home’ policies, alongside other community and physical distancing measures, such as the cancellation of mass gatherings, and the closure of educational institutions, work places and public spaces. This approach has collectively reduced transmission and, as of 9 June 2020, the 14-day incidence in the EU/EEA and the UK overall has declined by 80% since the peak on 9 April. The initial wave of transmission has passed its peak in all countries apart from Poland and Sweden.

Although these stringent physical distancing measures have reduced transmission, they are highly disruptive to society, both economically and socially. All countries that had implemented enforced ‘stay-at-home’ orders for the general population have initiated full or partial relaxation of these measures, and several have begun a full or partial re-opening of small retail shops and other public spaces. At the present time, just before the summer holiday period, as Member States relax limitations, there is a risk that people will not adhere firmly to the recommended measures still in place due to ‘isolation fatigue’. Therefore, continuous efforts are needed to ensure that the remaining physical distancing and infection prevention control measures continue be observed to limit the spread of the disease. The pandemic is not over, and hypothetical forecasting indicates a rise in cases is likely in the coming weeks.

At this stage, the following measures are essential to maintain a reduced level of transmission and avoid resurgence:

A robust monitoring framework to closely monitor the epidemiological situation, rapidly detect increased transmission, assess the impact of the interventions in place and avoid a resurgence of COVID-19

An expanded testing strategy aiming for comprehensive testing of all individuals displaying symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In particular, a systematic or more comprehensive testing approach is suggested in high-risk populations or settings. It is suggested that testing should be ramped up and tests made easily and quickly available to all individuals displaying symptoms compatible with COVID-19, including those with mild symptoms. Member States should also consider implementing PCR-based prevalence studies and sero-epidemiological studies to monitor the spread of disease.

A framework for contact tracing, based on extensive testing, active case finding, early detection of cases, isolation of cases, quarantine and follow-up of contacts, possibly supported by electronic tools and applications.

Long-term sustainable implementation of essential non-pharmaceutical interventions, irrespective of transmission rates, and the ability to amend strategies rapidly in response to indications of increased transmission. Reinstatement or introduction of further measures could be considered at local or regional level, or for specific population groups, depending on transmission patterns. Protection of the most vulnerable and at-risk populations is of paramount importance as they have suffered most of the burden from this pandemic in terms of morbidity, mortality and need for healthcare.

A strong risk communication strategy should remind citizens that the pandemic is far from over. People need to be aware that the public health measures to limit the spread of the virus will continue to impact the way we move, work and travel, and our leisure activities for the foreseeable future. This is especially important as Europe moves towards the summer holidays, when changes in people’s behaviour, activities and movements may cause people to switch back to pre-pandemic and potentially risky behaviour patterns. Four key risk communication messages are proposed: This is a marathon, not a sprint. We must not drop our guard. We all need to adjust to a ‘new normal’. Together, our actions give us the power to control the spread of the virus.

1,it is (more risky|riskier) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52849691,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People sunbathing on the beach by Bournemouth pier as lockdown eases

Relaxing lockdown is a risk because levels of the coronavirus are still ""very high"", one of the government's top science advisers says.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait.

The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings.

One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.

'Little time for stringent measures'

""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.

Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases.

They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase.

Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus.

But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.

The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports.

Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over.

However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"".

The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick.

This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Behavioural scientists advising government ""strongly recommend"" monitoring how well people were keeping to the rules.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours.

The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective.

'Taking a risk'

However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster.

Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here.""

And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day.

Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate.

The documents also showed:

On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""

The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.

Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts

In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""

The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings

Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""

The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk

Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""

Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms

Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1

Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.

""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence.""

As we venture out again to enjoy summer activities, many of you have submitted questions asking about the risk of COVID-19 during various activities. You want to know: What types of situations should be avoided? Is it safe to take my child to dance class? What preventive measures can be taken?

We're happy to see these questions, because it's important to not let your guard down.

""Even if you are seeing more people out, you still need to be cautious and take the virus seriously,"" says Sara H. Bares, MD, Nebraska Medicine infectious diseases specialist. ""And remember that you do not have to have symptoms to transmit the virus.""

Those at higher risk should certainly be more cautious, but young and otherwise healthy individuals can get sick too. We should all act responsibly to avoid putting others in harm's way.

Here are seven ways to recognize risky situations:

1. You're finding it hard to stay 6 feet away from others.

A safe situation is one where you can maintain 6 feet of space between yourself and people you don't live with. Droplets produced by talking, coughing or sneezing generally carry approximately 6 feet.

2. People aren't wearing masks.

Masks serve two purposes:

They protect you from exposure

They also prevent you spreading the virus to others if you are asymptomatic or presymptomatic

Any two or three-ply cotton mask that covers the nose and mouth will work. Wash your hands before you put on your mask and after you take off your mask. If you wear a reusable mask, wash it regularly.

If you are returning to work in a shared office space, wearing a mask is a good idea. If you are working in a private office, it's okay to take off the mask when you're alone in your office. Just be sure to wear it when using common spaces like bathrooms, hallways and breakrooms.

If you are wearing a mask, but others around you aren't, you're still in a risky situation, so be extra cautious.

3. You're inside.

Outdoor activities are generally safer than indoor activities. A study of more than 7,300 cases in China show that just one case was linked to outdoor transmission.

For example, playing golf in a small group outside is less risky than practicing yoga with a small group in an enclosed room. And eating inside a restaurant is much riskier than eating outside. If you are going to a restaurant, pick one with outdoor seating.

4. You're having contact with people you don't live with.

Sustained contact (more than 15 minutes) is a higher risk situation than brief contact. For example, stopping to talk to someone while you're out walking your dog is much riskier than just walking by and waving hello.

5. There are a lot of people around.

We are all craving social interaction, but please avoid large social gatherings. Try to restrict your circle to a small group of people you trust.

If you absolutely must host a social gathering, take precautions to minimize risk:

Limit your guest list to 10 people or less

Hold gatherings outside

Place chairs or tables 6 feet apart

Ask guests to bring their own coolers with beverages and snacks

Reserve a designated bathroom for guests Put out disposable paper towels rather than a cloth towel Have disinfectant wipes available to wipe area after use



6. People are yelling, laughing or singing without masks on.

Talking, yelling, exercising and singing can spread infected respiratory droplets. Any time inhaling and exhaling occur there is potential to spread the virus.

Singing and yelling aerosolize respiratory droplets, or convert them into a fine spray. Follow that with deep breathing, and you can start to understand how easy it is for tiny viral droplets to invade your lungs.

7. Food is laid out on tables and counters or isn't individually served.

People sharing food utensils and congregating around areas where food is laid out can pose a risk. Try to avoid buffet-style serving situations. And if you plan to attend a gathering where this is happening, consider eating before you go or bring your own snacks and drinks.

What about herd immunity?

You may have heard talk about herd immunity. Herd immunity is the idea that when most of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, it gives indirect protection to people who aren't.

The problem is that we don't know if people generate long-term immunity after they've had COVID-19. Some viruses only cause temporary immunity, or none at all. If the virus that causes COVID-19 doesn't generate a durable immune response inside the body, the concept of herd immunity won't work.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 70% or more of the population needs to have immunity to the coronavirus before herd immunity is achieved. Currently, it is estimated that Nebraska is well below this threshold. Even in the hardest hit areas, like New York City, studies indicate that only about 20% of residents have immunity.

Unfortunately, herd immunity isn't a realistic solution to the current pandemic. So it's up to all of us to choose safer activities over riskier ones, and take precautions in public.","        Skip to main content                    menu                 UNMC  Nebraska Medicine      Call For an Appointment  800.922.0000    Find a Doctor  Find a Location  Find a Service    Patients & Visitors  About Us  For Providers  Giving  Careers  One Chart              COVID-19: How we're keeping you safe  Read our visitor policy    The coronavirus is still in our community.

2,it is (more safe|safer) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52804795,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought

As lockdowns are eased all over the world, what are the risks of getting infected as people come into closer contact with each other?

It's a question that scientists have been exploring in a variety of settings including restaurants and offices.

Frustratingly, the evidence for how the virus can be transmitted is often slim and if the answers seem vague it's because the science is uncertain.

It comes amid pressure from businesses, such as pubs, to be allowed to reopen.

But the influence is also coming from people wondering if the rules are too strict.

What are the key factors?

The most obvious is distance.

Research that began in the 1930s showed that when someone coughs, most of the droplets they release either evaporate or fall to the ground within about one metre.

That's why the World Health Organization (WHO) settled on its ""one metre"" rule for social distancing.

Some governments have opted for a safer limit of 1.5m with the UK and others preferring an even more cautious 2m.

The guidance essentially means that the further you're apart, the safer you ought to be but it's not distance alone that matters.

The second key factor is timing - how long you're close to someone.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The UK government has adopted a 2m rule for social distancing

The UK government's advice is that spending six seconds with an infected person 1m away carries the same risk as spending one minute with them if they're 2m away.

And where it's not possible to keep your distance from a colleague, the aim is to limit the time together to 15 minutes.

But as well as timing, there's another important issue: ventilation.

Being outside carries the least risk because any virus released by someone infected will be diluted in the breeze.

That doesn't mean the possibility of transmission is zero.

Even out of doors, the UK's official advice is to stay 2m apart and, if you're closer, try not to talk face-to-face.

But inside, where there isn't much fresh air and where people might be close together for longer, the chances of becoming infected are obviously greater.

What are the risks indoors in a restaurant?

A fascinating insight comes from a study in the Chinese city of Guangzhou which tracked how a cluster of infections occurred.

Sitting at tables that were one metre apart, people were having a meal last January.

One of the diners was infected with coronavirus but hadn't realised because they had no symptoms.

But in the following days, another nine people who'd been in the restaurant at the time came down with Covid-19 - including five who'd been sitting at other tables several metres away.

Scientists investigating the infections reached a conclusion about the most likely route of transmission: that droplets containing the virus - released by the infected person - were circulated by air conditioning.

""The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow,"" their study says, blaming two air conditioning units mounted high on a wall.

This is not proof that the virus can be spread this way but the research certainly suggests that it is a plausible route.

And, if confirmed, it would mean that in any room with a similar system of ventilation, even moving tables more than one metre apart would still not guarantee to keep people safe.

What do we know about the effect of ventilation?

To try to understand the risks, a team from the University of Oregon, specialising in the study of microbes in buildings, simulated different types of ventilation in a restaurant.

In one scenario, someone at a corner table coughs without covering their mouth and releases droplets and particles that are projected through the air.

The largest droplets land on their own table - that's what you'd expect with the WHO's 'one metre rule'.

Image copyright University of Oregon Image caption Computer modelling by the University of Oregon showing the potential spread of coronavirus in a restaurant with an air conditioning unit

But smaller ones reach beyond the immediate area and are caught in a current of air coming from an air conditioning unit at the other end of the room.

The result is similar to what's thought to have happened in the restaurant in Guangzhou: tiny droplets and particles are spread to people at other tables.

As with that study, this simulation doesn't prove that the coronavirus can be transmitted this way or, if it did, that it would make anyone ill.

That depends on whether the virus is still active after being blown across the room and on whether the person receiving it gets a large enough ""dose"" - but the possibility of infection can't be ruled out.

According Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg, professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, who led the study, the virus ""can be spread further than people might realise"".

What can be done to make restaurants safer?

The Oregon team simulated another scenario in the same restaurant in which there's an open window beside the person who coughs and an extractor vent on the opposite wall.

This time the cloud of droplets and particles is not pushed around the room but instead travels in a fairly direct line from window to vent with the result that fewer people are caught in it.

A flow of fresh air to dilute the virus is one of several techniques highlighted by the team as options for managing Covid-19.

Image copyright University of Oregon Image caption The simulations showed how fresh air from an open window could carry the virus to a vent

""It's really impossible to completely eliminate risk,"" says Prof Van Den Wymelenberg, ""but what we showed was a concept for how you could reduce transmission.""

""The good news is that there are things you can do to make safer spaces.""

In addition to bringing in fresh air through windows or mechanical ventilation, other options include improving the standard of filtration and also humidifying the air - moist conditions might encourage droplets to sink to the floor.

What does this mean on planes?

Social distancing isn't likely to be possible - unless the aircraft is half empty - and by definition you'll be in close contact with others for more than 15 minutes.

So on the basis of those two key factors, the risks may well be higher. The question of ventilation is more debatable.

On the one hand, the air in the cabin is constantly circulated so if someone coughs, even a few rows away, there is a chance the infection will be spread.

On the other hand, modern aircraft filter the cabin air every few minutes and to a high standard.

What about the risks at work?

In factories and offices, social distancing may be harder to follow.

Dr Julian Tang of the University of Leicester has come up an easy ""breath test"" to check if you're too close to colleagues.

A consultant virologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, he's studied how the air is moved when people speak and concludes that something as simple as a conversation could pass the virus.

""If you can smell your friend's breath - the garlic or curry or alcohol - you're inhaling what they're breathing out.

""And if you're inhaling enough of that air to smell it, then you're close enough to inhale any virus that's also carried in the air with it.""

So how can transmission take place?

So far the public advice has focused on what's called the ""droplet"" route, someone coughing or sneezing into the eyes, nose or mouth of a person nearby, which has led to the social distancing rules.

It's also highlighted a second route - surfaces - in which a person who's infected passes on the virus through contact either directly by shaking hands or by exhaling over surfaces like kitchen worktops.

Image copyright Hexagon/MSC Image caption Modelling by Hexagon/MSC Software showing how an infected person could pass the virus to a fellow passenger on a train.

Others then get the contamination on their hands, directly or by using the same space at work or at home - which is why handwashing is so important.

But there's a third possibility as well - tiny droplets or particles being carried in the air by speech, for example and that route might be the most important, according to Dr Tang.

""When you're talking to a colleague you don't touch them, you don't spit on them, most of the interaction is by voice and breathing.""

All of which reinforces the idea that there isn't one way to stay safe: it involves social distancing and keeping any close contacts brief and checking for healthy ventilation.

2,it is (more safe|safer) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53222356,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Passport control at Larnaca airport, Cyprus

The EU has decided that from Wednesday EU borders will be reopened to citizens from 15 non-EU countries, including Canada, Morocco and Australia, but not the US, Brazil and Russia.

China is on the list, but subject to a reciprocal agreement, still pending.

The unanimous decision by the European Council is not legally binding, so states can choose not to open up to all those countries.

Diplomats spent five days debating the list, amid varying pandemic concerns.

The so-called ""safe travel destinations"" are, besides China: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.

The UK and four other non-EU states - Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - are automatically included as ""safe"".

The BBC's Gavin Lee in Brussels says there was intense lobbying by representatives of the US, Russia and Turkey to get included on the list.

EU officials say the decision was based on a number of scientific factors:

Ensuring that the Covid-19 infection rate in the country was low enough (where nations had fewer than 16 in every 100,000 infected)

That there was a downward trend of cases

That social distancing measures were at ""a sufficient level""

One diplomat from a north European member state told the BBC that a ""certain amount of geopolitics influenced the decision too"" and that ""Balkan and Eastern European states had recommended"" that Georgia, a former Soviet state, be included.

The Hungarian government is understood to have lobbied for Serbia's inclusion. Spanish officials say they requested that Morocco be on the list, provided there was an agreement of reciprocity.

Denmark and Austria were among several member states arguing for the number of countries to be fewer than 15.

But in the end, it was adopted unanimously by member states.

Each state will have to announce when it intends to start readmitting citizens from some or all of those countries.

French officials say they expect to implement the decision in the ""coming days"".

The Czech Republic has published a list of eight countries that it considers safe for travel.

The EU list will be updated every two weeks.

UK covered by Brexit transition phase

Many border controls have been lifted for EU citizens travelling inside the bloc. Future rules for UK travellers are part of the current Brexit negotiations.

But UK nationals are still to be treated in the same way as EU citizens until the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, the EU Commission says.

So during this period UK nationals and their family members are exempt from the EU's temporary travel restriction.

EU nations in the 26-member Schengen zone normally allow passport-free border crossings for EU citizens, but national authorities have reimposed restrictions in this crisis.

The UK is currently negotiating temporary ""air bridges"" with several EU member states, so that the coronavirus pandemic does not totally block summer holidays - the busiest season in Europe for tourism, which employs millions of people.

In the EU discussions there were splits between those such as Spain - wanting the boost of tourism, but preferring to play safe because they have been hit so hard by Covid-19 - and others like Greece and Portugal, which depend on tourism but are less scarred by the virus.

You'd think it'd be quite straightforward, deciding which non-EU countries to consider ""safe"". But it's been a tortuous, divisive process, mixing politics and economics, as well as public health.

Countries like Germany and Spain, horrified by the devastation of Covid-19, wanted to play it safe.

They pushed to have a short list of countries with low infection rates, a good health service and reliable health data.

But Greece and Portugal had other ideas. Anxious to boost their post-lockdown, flagging economies with tourism, and less scarred by widespread infection at the height of the pandemic, they wanted as long a list as possible.

Then came France, insisting on reciprocity. If a non-EU country was barring flights from the bloc, argued Paris, they shouldn't appear on the list.

And finally: diplomatic considerations. How awkward for the EU to include some countries but not others. Thumbs up to visitors from Canada, Japan and China from 1 July - if Beijing allows EU visitors entry - but not travellers from the US.

After days of haggling, the final list is an attempted compromise. Much metaphorical sweat, blood and tears for a list that is advisory only, open to exceptions and will be regularly tweaked and updated.","        Homepage Accessibility links Skip to content Accessibility Help  BBC Account Notifications  Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Menu Search Search the BBC Search the BBC             News   BBC News Navigation     Sections           Home      Video      World   selected     UK      Business      Tech      Science      Stories      Entertainment & Arts      Health      World News TV      In Pictures      Reality Check      Newsbeat      Special Reports      Explainers      The Reporters      Have Your Say        World  selected     Africa      Asia      Australia      Europe   selected     Latin America      Middle East      US & Canada                 Europe               Europe              Coronavirus: EU to allow in visitors from 15 'safe' countries       30 June 2020              Share this with Facebook           Share this with Messenger           Share this with Twitter           Share this with Email           Share this with Facebook           Share this with WhatsApp           Share this with Messenger           Share this with Twitter      Share    Share this with  These are external links and will open in a new window      Email  Share this with Email       Facebook  Share this with Facebook       Messenger  Share this with Messenger       Messenger  Share this with Messenger       Twitter  Share this with Twitter       Pinterest  Share this with Pinterest       WhatsApp  Share this with WhatsApp       LinkedIn  Share this with LinkedIn     Copy this link   https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53222356   Read more about sharing.

Most of these changes would amount to an earthquake for corporate culture, making the office less social, interactive, and serendipitous, and more like the amalgamation of many private workstations. Until we have a vaccine, and perhaps even after, many workers may determine that if they’re going to feel as alone in the office as they do at home, there’s no point to commuting in the first place.

The future is uncertain, and alternative scenarios are possible, especially if offices adopt widespread tests and temperature checks for months or years before the broad administration of a vaccine. These tests, while strict, might make some people feel safer inside the office than in any other public venue that lacks similar health transparency. With the confidence that work is the safest place other than their own home, some employees might treat the office as a multipurpose isolation unit. Drinking at work, under the protective shield of temperature checks, would make for a safer coronavirus-era ritual than gathering colleagues at an actual bar.

2. COVID-PROOF THE RESTAURANTS

On January 24, a Chinese family of five sat down to lunch in a crowded restaurant in Guangzhou, the most populous city in southern China. They had arrived in the city the previous day from Wuhan. It was a balmy afternoon in Guangzhou, with mid-day temperatures rising into the high 70s, and the restaurant on the third floor of a five-story building was buzzing with more than 80 patrons and no windows. The family gathered around a table along the back wall, between two local families, as an air conditioner pumped cool air across the three tables.","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe      Ideas   Social Distancing Is Not Enough   We will need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the sort of interactions that can lead to more infections.   May 22, 2020  Derek Thompson Staff writer at The Atlantic       Piotr Malecki / Panos Pictures / R​edux     Link Copied    Updated at 12:08 a.m. ET on May 26, 2020. COVID-19 has mounted a sustained attack on public life, especially indoor life. Many of the largest super-spreader events took place inside—at a church in South Korea , an auditorium in France , a conference in Massachusetts . The danger of the indoors is more than anecdotal. A Hong Kong paper awaiting peer review found that of 7,324 documented cases in China, only one outbreak occurred outside—during a conversation among several men in a small village. The risk of infection indoors is almost 19 times higher than in open-air environments, according to another study from researchers in Japan . Appropriately, just about every public indoor space in America has been shut down or, in the case of essential businesses such as grocers, adapted for social-distancing restrictions. These closures have been economically ruinous, transforming large swaths of urban and suburban life into a morbid line of darkened windows . Today, states are emerging from the lockdown phase of the crisis and entering a queasy period of reopening. But offices, schools, stores, theaters, restaurants, bars, gyms, fitness centers, and museums will have no semblance of normalcy until we learn how to be safe—and feel safe—inside.        Read: A guide to staying safe as states reopen To open these spaces, we must be guided by science and expertise. Fortunately for us, researchers are discovering the secrets of how COVID-19 spreads with a combination of clever modeling and detective work. Before we review the relevant studies and draw out lessons for the future of the great indoors, a brief word of humility. Our understanding of this disease is dynamic. Today’s conventional wisdom could be tomorrow’s busted myth. Think of these studies not as gospels, but as clues in a gradually unraveling mystery. 1.  COVID-PROOF THE OFFICE On March 8, South Korean public-health officials learned of a COVID-19-positive patient working in a call center in downtown Seoul. The office was located in one of the densest parts of the city, on the 11th floor of a 19-story mixed-use building with hundreds of offices and apartments. More than 1,000 people worked or lived in the building, sharing several elevators and a lobby. The possibility of mass infection was high. But investigators found that the outbreak was surprisingly concentrated . Of the 97 people in the building who tested positive for the disease, 94 worked on one floor—in the call center. Of those 94, all but a handful worked in one densely packed phone bank. On one side of the floor, the disease was transmitted to two-thirds of employees. But less than 5 percent of the rest of the floor tested positive, as did less than 1 percent of the remainder of the building. A floor plan of the site of a coronavirus outbreak in Seoul, South Korea. The blue seats show where people with confirmed cases sat. ( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) In its conclusion, the Korean CDC writes that the spread of the virus was almost entirely limited to the one floor “despite considerable interaction between workers on different floors in the elevators and lobby.” This would suggest that the main facilitator wasn’t common touch points, such as doors and elevator buttons, but rather common airspace . When people talk—or sneeze or cough—they produce respiratory droplets that can come to rest in other people’s mouths, noses, and lungs. Talking for hours in close quarters, in an unventilated space, can create an ideal petri dish for COVID-19 transmission. It would be irresponsible to use the Korean study an an illustrative example if it were an outlier. But its main finding is fully in line with the emerging scientific consensus. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its summary of COVID-19 transmission to clarify that the virus “ does not spread easily ” from touching surfaces or objects—like, say, elevator buttons. Instead, they wrote, “the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person … through respiratory droplets.” [ Derek Thompson: What’s behind South Korea’s COVID-19 exceptionalism? ]        What does the science of indoor transmission mean for the future of the white-collar workplace? In a document shared with the World Bank , the South Korean government set out a 50-point plan for making offices safer. Masks are recommended for all employees. Desks and chairs are to be spread out or arranged in a “chess” or zigzag pattern so that no two individuals are sitting directly across from each other.

COVID-PROOF THE RESTAURANTS On January 24, a Chinese family of five sat down to lunch in a crowded restaurant in Guangzhou, the most populous city in southern China. They had arrived in the city the previous day from Wuhan. It was a balmy afternoon in Guangzhou, with mid-day temperatures rising into the high 70s, and the restaurant on the third floor of a five-story building was buzzing with more than 80 patrons and no windows. The family gathered around a table along the back wall, between two local families, as an air conditioner pumped cool air across the three tables.        Derek Thompson: The pandemic will change American retail forever When they left the restaurant, a member of the family felt a fever coming on and, after checking into the hospital, received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Within two weeks, multiple people from each of the three tables—and 10 lunch patrons from the Guangzhou restaurant in total—had been diagnosed with the disease. When the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the matter , it published a diagram that told a simple story: One asymptomatic person in a restaurant had infected nine others in the direct path of the air conditioner. None of the dozens of other patrons or servers got sick. A floor plan of restaurant tables and air-conditioning flow at the site of a coronavirus outbreak in Guangzhou, China. The yellow circle indicates an infected patient; red circles show future patients. ( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) It seemed to the researchers that the vector of transmission in the restaurant wasn’t a plate of food, an elevator button, or any matter of human touching, but air. Strong airflow from the AC unit had ferried coronavirus-poisoned droplets from table to table. “We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation,” the researchers wrote . Many of the necessary interventions for restaurants will adhere to the same philosophy that guides the reimagining of the office. Masks may become commonplace on servers, as might barriers between tables. In an interview with The Atlantic , the chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio suggested reducing interactions between patrons and waiters by asking diners to order their meals online before they arrive or on tablets at the table, like in an airport. Social distancing in the kitchen might mean fewer chefs, which could make complex dishes and extravagant plating impossible. “Until there’s a vaccine, I don’t think dine-in restaurants will get back to normal in this country,” Steve Salis, a restaurant owner in Washington, D.C., told me. “We could introduce things like finger bowls or hand wipes, like you have at some Japanese restaurants, but for every cuisine. We could add public sinks in the dining room, where people can get up and wash their hands at a counter. We might have to retrofit our restaurants to make them easier to clean. As for tables and bar stools, those will have to be socially distanced. At my diner, I might chop up booths to make them more private.” Read: Stanley Tucci on cooking your way through the pandemic Another idea: Put everything outside. Some American cities, including Berkeley, California, and Cincinnati , have done just that, by  announcing plans to close streets and free up outdoor dining space for restaurants. * But for many cities, wide-scale al fresco dining is unrealistic, not only because of necessary road use, but also because we can’t ask the weather to stop. There will be snow in Boston, wind in Chicago, and rain in Seattle. An open-air restaurant is a lovely thing, but ceilings were invented for a reason.        Restaurants will respond to the pandemic as they already have—by cobbling together a variety of businesses, including delivery and curbside pickup, and selling specialty groceries. Even so, their outlook is dire. Colicchio told me that more than half of American restaurants may not reopen. “In my case, for at least two of my restaurants, most of the business comes through private parties and conferences,” he said . “For the foreseeable future, that’s gone.” 3.  COVID-PROOF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT On the evening of Tuesday, March 10, 61 singers gathered for choir practice just north of Seattle. It was a standard rehearsal, as members sang in close quarters, shared snacks, and stacked chairs together at the end of the two-and-a-half-hour session. Five days later, the choir director sent an urgent email to the group. Several members had developed fevers, she said. The following Tuesday’s rehearsal was canceled. But by then, it was too late. Fifty-three of the 61 singers became ill, making for an “attack rate” of 87 percent. Three members of the choir were hospitalized. Two died. The Washington choir represents the most aggressive outbreak I have come across, with an attack rate almost twice as high as the Korean call center. It had many features we’ve already established to be dangerous: an intimate crowd gathered in a small room, sharing air, food, and surfaces. But what if singing accelerated the transmission of the disease? Read: How the pandemic will end In a study subsequently published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, ” researchers emphasized that “the act of singing, itself,” might have contributed to transmission, because choir members were belting out more of the virus. Some people—known as “superemitters”—release more particles into the air when they speak, because they are unusually loud or slobbery talkers. But even normal gabbers can release an exceptional number of droplets if they’re singing or theatrically projecting their voice. Many super-spreader events have been ceremonies that involve group prayers and exclamations, such as religious gatherings. On February 16, a 61-year-old Korean woman with COVID-19 triggered hundreds of infections when she prayed with 1,000 worshippers in a large windowless church in Daegu, South Korea. (To this day, more than 60 percent of Korea’s COVID-19 cases are in Daegu.) Two days later, in France, several hundred Christian worshippers from around the world packed into a dark auditorium in the small town of Mulhouse for an annual festival. French authorities have since linked more than 2,000 global cases to this one meeting, including cases in  French Guyana, Corsica, Burkina Faso, and Switzerland. These stories, combined with the science of large-droplet and airborne transmission, suggest that social distancing isn’t enough: We need saliva control too. Other countries are doing so, already. Germany has reportedly banned singing at religious services, and South Korea has prohibited spitting in its professional baseball league.        Spittle rules won’t be enough to make our public entertainment places safer, either. We will need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the sort of interactions that can lead to more infections. “When we go back to sports stadiums and theaters, people are going to have to adjust their expectations,” says Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure-assessment science at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health. First, he told me, full-capacity stadiums will be impossible in the social-distancing age, and most attendees will be advised to wear masks. Second, everything that can be made touchless should be, including ticketing and concessions. “To avoid clustering at the hot-dog stands, stadium food vendors should serve as much as possible directly to people’s seats,” Allen said. Third, public-entertainment venues will have to reimagine queuing. “Our theories about crowd control, which are dominated by concerns for physical security, typically squeeze large numbers of people into a scarce number of heavily guarded entrances,” he said. But in a pandemic, tightly packed queues are the very hazard we want to avoid. “It’ll be very important to reduce crowding at the entrance of stadiums and theaters by adding additional entrance points or staggering admissions by time to avoid overcrowding, Allen said. When you put all of these stories, studies, blueprints, and advice together, it amounts to a relatively straightforward pandemic playbook. For memory’s sake, let’s reduce the major takeaways to a convenient acronym: SAFE.  - Social distancing : This one you probably knew before you read this article. Keep a healthy distance between yourself and others—six feet is a good general rule—especially when you are near them for an extended period of time.  - Airflow awareness : Every noncontact activity—talking, eating, working out—becomes significantly safer when you take it outside. As the previously mentioned Japanese study and Hong Kong survey indicated, the odds of transmission in a closed, indoor space are several orders of magnitude higher than in open-air environments.  - Face masks : Wear them. They’re not just for you; they’re for everybody around you .  - Expectoration (sorry for using a fancy word for spit to make the acronym work): COVID-19 appears to spread both through large-droplet transmission, such as from sneezes, and through the airborne transmission of smaller, aerosolized droplets, such as those that spray out of the mouths of talkers. Beware especially of indoor environments and activities that naturally include lots of gabbing (such as a long office meeting), singing (such as a choir practice), shouting (such as a high-school gym), or heavy breathing (such as an intense indoor workout class ).  Read: America’s patchwork pandemic is fraying even further        As an indoor person myself—and a lover of theater, sports, and restaurants—it’s painful to think about the range of activities that will be pinched in the next year and the businesses and lives that will suffer for it. Toward the end of my reporting for this piece, I emailed a national-security worker who also teaches singing in the Washington, D.C., area. She’s heard that in-person singing may be off-limits until a vaccine is widely available, a possibility that would shutter musicals and vocal lessons for a year or longer. “Despite all the chaos and intense news, this has been the thing that has hit the hardest,” she said. So, she’s planning to offer singing lessons on Zoom. America’s public spaces will have to show a similar flexibility and resiliency to make it through the next year. Even as the United States reopens, some old rituals—such as going to bars, group workouts, and packed concerts—will have to remain paused. People will still drink and sweat and sing, just differently. Eventually, the old world will come back. The great indoors will return. But until then, Americans will have to balance their rituals and nostalgia with a humble respect for our unfolding understanding of COVID-19. *  This article previously misstated that Berkeley, California, had closed its streets to make space for outdoor dining.

2,it is (more safe|safer) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),5,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/2020/05/safety-tips-to-help-you-travel-again-during-covid-19-cvd/,"Although many restrictions are still in place, travel is slowly starting up again. People locked down for months want to stretch their legs, see something other than a screen, and boost the economy. Restaurants and some tourist attractions (Florida’s Universal Orlando Resort, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) are opening for local and domestic travel. A few countries (Greece, Italy) are starting to welcome international travelers.

But how can you safely explore a world of potentially deadly encounters with friendly people who might infect you (or who you might expose to the virus)? Is the airplane really a soaring petri dish? Is visiting a national park possible while social distancing? And if you choose a seemingly safer road trip, can you stop to use a public restroom?

A poll by National Geographic and Morning Consult finds that just 2 percent of 2,200 Americans said they’d jump on a plane now, and only another 8 percent would consider it later this summer. That’s wise with travel advisories still in place, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warnings against international travel and cautions about travel within the U.S., and with many countries and states (Maine, Hawaii) still requiring 14 days of post-travel self-isolation regardless of symptoms.

As we recently report, travel planning is good for your mental health. Knowing more about real and perceived COVID-19 risks might help you feel better about getting out as roadblocks lift. Here are best practices for travelers.

Should I get on an airplane?

Challenge: Being crammed next to strangers in a flying metal tube

Best practice: It’s reassuring to know that “data to date suggest only rare possible occurrences of in-flight transmission” of COVID-19, says Dr. Lin H. Chen, associate professor at Harvard Medical School and director of Cambridge’s Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn. She explains that if everyone follows the World Health Organization’s guidelines, the risk of transmission aboard planes, and anywhere else, is significantly reduced.

“Many people think they get sick on an airplane, but the reality is that the air quality on an airplane is actually really good—high amounts of clean outdoor air and all recirculated air passes through a HEPA filter,” says Joe Allen. An assistant professor and director of the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Allen explains that you’re more likely to pick up a bug standing in line at airport security, at the boarding gate, or on the subway.

Airports and airlines are trying to minimize the risks of contagions in their often-crowded environments. Intensive cleaning is now the norm; planes are now being fogged with electrostatic disinfectant that sticks to surfaces like seatbelts. Some airlines give you wipes and the Transportation Security Administration has upped the size of hand sanitizer bottles you can bring on board from 3.4 ounces to 12.

Face coverings are required to board most flights. Airlines are trying to seat people so they have more space. But that doesn’t necessarily mean middle seats are remaining empty, especially with reductions in numbers of flights. There’s no national U.S. policy yet, but several airlines are checking for fevers. They won’t let you fly with a temperature above 100.4℉ (though testing is far from foolproof).

Internationally, some destinations require proof of a negative COVID-19 test; other destinations test passengers on arrival. Many have mandatory 14-day quarantines, sometimes requiring you to submit a quarantine plan for approval, download an app, or get a tracking bracelet to ensure you follow the rules. Vaccination certification may eventually be needed for travel, but so far the science doesn’t support “immunity passports” or proof that a person has had COVID-19 and is, in theory, immune.

Should I head to a national park?

Challenge: Avoiding big crowds in the great outdoors

Best practice: “There are many health benefits to being outside in nature, and the risks are low and manageable,” says Allen. The key is keeping a six-foot distance. A good practice at a park is to pretend that other people are grizzly bears and stay away from them.

Check the National Park Service’s find-a-park website to see if the park is closed or partially closed (restrooms and food services, in particular), for limits on numbers of visitors, and other rules like mask-wearing. Avoid group activities that involve close contact and practice social distancing at camp sites. Joyce Sanchez, an infectious disease specialist and medical director of the Travel Health Clinic at Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, reminds us that “summer is tick and mosquito season,” so don’t forget your bug spray and sunscreen (though perhaps a face-mask tan will become a badge of honor that you’re doing your part to protect others).

Should I rent a cottage by the sea?

Challenge: Assessing the safety of beaches and vacation rentals

Best practice: Like park trips, seaside vacations are great if you can stay away from others and obey beach closure rules. There’s no evidence you can catch COVID-19 from the water (it’s other people you should be concerned about). Remember to bring your two best beach friends: reef-safe sunscreen free of oxybenzone and hand sanitizer.

Should I stay in a hotel?

Challenge: Distancing safely and trusting housekeeping

Best practice: Hotels that take better care of their employees (by providing them with personal protective equipment and paid sick leave) are more likely to take better care of you. Check the website of any hotel you’re considering to determine how they’re responding to COVID-19. Many U.S. hotels are following the American Hotel and Lodging Association’s new Safe Stay guidelines.

Choose properties that base their protocols on science, rather than things that sound good but have little effect or take focus away from areas that really matter. Look for hotels that have installed plexiglass at reception and that require staff to wear masks, or where you can check-in online and use your phone as your room key.

Avoid elevators and, if able, “take the opportunity to exercise and use the stairs,” advises Sanchez. Room service may be safer than the restaurant. Go for a swim if the pool isn’t crowded: Standard pool cleaning kills viruses, so the pool is probably safe; it’s the people you need to worry about. While clean rooms are important, what’s more important is staying six feet away from others. And, of course, wash your hands when you arrive in your room and again before you leave.

Should I use a public restroom?

Challenge: Taking care of business in busy bathrooms

Best practice: Assume public restrooms “are not properly disinfected and treat surfaces as if they have live virus on them,” says Sanchez. That said, it’s often necessary to use. When you do, choose single-stall and well-ventilated bathrooms if you can, and keep your distance from others.

Chen says that “good hand hygiene is key after using a public bathroom,” meaning wash and dry your hands; if there’s no soap, use hand sanitizer. She adds “I am unaware of any data to show that flushing aerosolizes SARS-CoV-2 and transmits the virus.” Regardless, it’s always good practice to put the lid down before you flush.

What about people who don’t wear masks?

Challenge: Staying safe while respecting others’ boundaries

Best practice: Following all the new COVID-19 protocols takes some getting used to. It’s easy to revert to pre-pandemic habits in new situations, when we’re stressed, and when we’re trying to relax and have fun. Being as kind and understanding as possible helps minimize stress.

Setting a good example is the best way to encourage others. Jonathon Day, associate professor and graduate program director at Purdue’s School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, says “safety when traveling (and when out and about in general) is a ‘co-creation.’”

“If it’s someone you know who is non-mask-wearing [or] non-social-distancing, it might be worth discussing the reasoning behind these measures,” says Chen. Remember that not everyone can wear a mask and that we’re all human and can forget the new norms. You could politely ask anyone who gets too close “would you mind giving us a bit more space, please?” but it might be easier just to move away from them. It’s likely not worth the risk, or the stress, to confront a stranger. If you can’t escape the situation, ask a store manager or flight attendant for help.

Remember that, with communicable diseases, “if everyone is responsible to themselves and community/society, then we would all be safer,” says Chen.

Know the safety basics

We’re still learning about COVID-19. But one consensus is that it seems to spread most easily by close contact between people. The CDC says that touching objects isn’t the main way of contracting it.

This means that whenever you’re away from home, the most important thing you can do is maintain a six-foot (or more) distance from people you don’t live with. Wearing a face covering also minimizes the chance you’ll pass a virus or other illness to others.

Other key prevention measures, outlined by the World Health Organization and other public health authorities: washing your hands well, avoiding touching your face, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, disinfecting frequently touched items like your phone, and staying home if you’re sick. Practicing these measures keeps you—and everyone else—safer, regardless of how far you roam. “COVID-19 has shown that we have shared responsibilities to reduce spread,” says Chen, who’s president of the International Society of Travel Medicine.

General considerations for travel

During a pandemic, going to the grocery store—let alone traveling to another city or country—requires new protocols. Follow policies about lockdown restrictions and mandatory quarantines, both at home and at your planned destination. The CDC provides links to the rules of each state’s and territory’s health departments. Many international borders remain closed to nonessential travel, and some countries also limit domestic travel between regions.

Examine your personal situation. Extra cautions are needed for anyone at elevated risk of contracting COVID-19. Check post-travel quarantine rules, including your employer’s. Just as important as protecting you and your loved ones is shielding other people. You don’t want to bring the virus from your community, especially to places with low case numbers, or bring it home (the CDC tracks cases and deaths by state and county). Consider whether the benefits of travel outweigh the risk that you might spread the virus.

When deciding where to go and how you’ll get there, scrutinize how easy it will be to stay away from other people. “Generally speaking, driving is going to be safer than flying commercially from an infection standpoint because you can control how you reach your destination—who is sharing the car with you, what measures are used for disinfecting surfaces, where you stop along the way, and when you return,” says Sanchez.","                        xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""                                          https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/2020/05/safety-tips-to-help-you-travel-again-during-covid-19-cvd.html  © 1996-2015 National Geographic Society, © 2015-

Photograph by CLEMENT MAHOUDEA, AFP/Getty Images          Regarding rentals, ask whether properties are cleaned according to public health guidelines, such as the WHO’s accommodation sector advice . Airbnb’s Enhanced Cleaning Initiative includes a 24- to 72-hour vacancy period between guests (though cleaners may visit during that window), but it’s likely unnecessary given evidence that the coronavirus floats in the air only up to three hours . Since it’s possible for the virus to live on surfaces for two or three days , you could give high-touch surfaces an extra clean. As Chen says, “good hand washing should overcome potentially contaminated touching.” If anxiety outweighs the benefits of a vacation, it’s a sign you’re not ready to venture out yet.

3,(risk|taking any risk) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/assessing-risk-factors.html,"COVID-19 can affect anyone, and the disease can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe. For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors.” Examples include older age or having certain underlying medical conditions.

CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations.

CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners.

Why Risk Factors Matter

People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection.

It is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you:

Take precautions as you go about your daily life and attend events.

Better understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19.

Anticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick.

Reduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors.

How We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease

Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. Potential risk factors that have been identified to date include:

Age

Race/ethnicity

Gender

Some medical conditions

Use of certain medications

Poverty and crowding

Certain occupations

Pregnancy

Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person’s risk.

Investigations

CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below. These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations.

3,(risk|taking any risk) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on June 25, 2020 to reflect available data as of May 29, 2020. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.

People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.  People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:  People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:   Chronic kidney disease  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant  Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)  Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies  Sickle cell disease  Type 2 diabetes mellitus   Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.  COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:   Asthma (moderate-to-severe)  Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)  Cystic fibrosis  Hypertension or high blood pressure  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines  Neurologic conditions, such as dementia  Liver disease  Pregnancy  Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)  Smoking  Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)  Type 1 diabetes mellitus   Want to see the evidence behind these lists?  The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.  Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19  It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.  The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:   Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.  Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.   If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.  Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.  As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities , running errands, and attending events and gatherings . There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.  People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves . Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.  In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.   If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions .  Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.  If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.   Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:  When to delay or cancel a visit   Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:  If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:  Lowest risk : Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.  More risk : Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).  Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.  Highest risk : Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

3,(risk|taking any risk) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/flu-sick-days.html,"These tips can help people with diabetes prepare for getting sick and take care of themselves if they do become ill.

Like everyone, people with diabetes can get sick even when trying their best to prevent it. So being prepared and knowing what to do if you get sick is very important. There are several things you can do now, but also talk to your doctor about the best way to handle being sick if it happens. Visit these pages for more information:

These tips can help you take care of yourself if you get sick.

Prepare Now Before Getting Sick

Make sure you have insulin, other diabetes medicines, and easy-to-fix foods in your home, enough for several weeks or longer:

Medicines and supplies

Milk of magnesia Medicine to control diarrhea Antacid Pain reliever Thermometer Suppositories to treat vomiting



Foods

Sports drinks Juice boxes Canned soup Regular gelatin Regular soft drinks Instant cooked cereals Crackers Instant pudding Unsweetened applesauce

If you can’t eat meals, you will need to eat or drink about 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours, such as 1½ cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1½ cup of fruit juice.

If You Get Sick

If you do get sick, your blood sugar can be hard to manage. You may not be able to eat or drink as much as usual, which can affect blood sugar levels.

Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar more often when you’re sick. That’s because when your body releases hormones to fight the illness, those hormones can also raise your blood sugar levels and increase how much insulin you need. This is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes since they depend on insulin to live.

When your body doesn’t have enough insulin, it starts breaking down fat as fuel, which produces ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can cause diabetic ketoacidosisexternal icon, or DKA. DKA is very serious and can cause a coma or even death.

If you think you may have DKA, use an over-the-counter kit to test your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, call your doctor right away. You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment.

Follow these additional steps when you’re sick even if your blood sugar is within your target range:

Continue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual .

. Test your blood sugar every 4 hours and keep track of the results.

Drink extra calorie-free liquids*, and try to eat as you normally would.

Weigh yourself every day. Losing weight without trying is a sign of high blood glucose.

Check your temperature every morning and evening. A fever may be a sign of infection.

*Drink plenty of fluids – 4 to 6 ounces every half-hour – to prevent dehydration. You may also need to drink beverages with sugar if you cannot get 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours from other food choices. Drink small portions of these sweet beverages to keep your blood sugar from getting too high.","                           Skip directly to site content  Skip directly to page options  Skip directly to A-Z link         Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

4,chance of (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/current-risk-assessment-novel-coronavirus-situation,"What is the risk of COVID-19 to the general population as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

The risk of COVID 19 in the general population of the EU/EEA and the UK is currently assessed as:

Low in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing showing very low detection rates.

Moderate in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.

This assessment is based on the information below:

Decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed and sustained in almost all Member States, but several are still reporting ongoing community transmission:

As of 10 June, 29 EU/EEA countries and the UK had a decreasing 14-day incidence, while the 14-day incidence was at the highest level yet observed in two countries (Poland and Sweden).

Twenty-eight countries are reporting a current 14-day incidence below 20 cases per 100 000 population. In two countries (Portugal and the United Kingdom) the current 14-day incidence remains at a rate between 20 and 100 cases per 100 000 population. In one country (Sweden) the current 14-day incidence is above 100 cases per 100 000 population.

There remains uncertainty as to the extent of viral circulation as there is limited information available on the proportion of community transmission that occurs outside of known transmission chains and/or due to importation across countries.

The implementation of robust response measures in the EU was temporarily associated with an observed decrease in incidence. Although the composition and intensity of implementation varied, all EU/EEA countries and the UK introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (recommended or enforced – refer to Annex 4). While uncertainty remains about the extent to which the combination and intensity of these measures had an impact on transmission, such measures appear to have been associated, at least temporarily, with decreases in the number of newly reported cases.

In summary, the probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2 for the general population ranges from low (in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing, showing very low detection rates) to very high (in areas where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place and where community transmission is still high).

While the majority of cases of COVID-19 have a mild course of illness, the analysis of data from TESSy shows that the risk of hospitalisation increases rapidly with age, from as early as 30 years, and that the risk of death increases from the age of 50 years, although the majority of hospitalisations and deaths are among the oldest age groups. Older males are particularly affected, being more likely than females of the same age to be hospitalised, require ICU/respiratory support, or die. All-cause excess mortality from EuroMOMO, particularly at this time when competing drivers (influenza and high/low temperatures) are largely absent, shows considerable excess mortality in multiple countries, affecting both the 15−64 and 65+ years age groups in the pooled analysis. Once infected, no specific treatment for COVID-19 exists, however early supportive therapy may improve outcomes. There are ongoing trials that have demonstrated some evidence for limited reduction of symptom duration. There is evidence that since the start of the pandemic, case management, supportive treatment and care has improved.

Overall, the impact of COVID-19 is assessed as moderate for the general population.

What is the risk of COVID-19 to the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

The risk of COVID 19 to the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome is currently assessed as:

Moderate in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing showing very low detection rates.

Very high in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.

This assessment was based on the information below:

The probability of infection in the different areas has been assessed above and is the same for populations with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome: from low to very high.

Analysis of TESSy data shows that persons over 65 years of age and/or with underlying health conditions infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk of severe illness and death compared with younger individuals.

Long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which commonly house the elderly and the frail, have been heavily affected by COVID-19. The disease spreads rapidly on introduction, causing high morbidity in residents, commonly with a case fatality of over 25%. LTCFs were the focus of over half of the fatal COVID-19 cases in several EU/EEA countries and the UK. In summary, the impact of COVID-19 is assessed as very high in the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome.

What is the risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to levels that require stricter response measures, as a consequence of lifting/adjusting community level physical distancing measures?

The risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to a level that may require the re-introduction of stricter control measures is currently assessed as:

Moderate if measures are phased out gradually, when only sporadic or cluster transmission is reported, and when appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place.

High if measures are phased out when there is still ongoing community transmission, and no appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place.

This assessment was based on the information below:

The implementation of robust response measures in EU/EEA countries and the UK was temporarily associated with a decrease in incidence.

In the few weeks since the phase-out of some of the response measures, no rapid or major increase in incidence has been observed. Although the composition and intensity of implementation vary, all EU/EEA countries and the UK have introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission (recommended or enforced).

In addition to the implemented response measures, other factors may have contributed to the observed decrease in incidence including seasonality, self-awareness of the population in disease prevention and adherence to measures implemented by governments, a better application of infection prevention and control measures in the community and healthcare settings, and an increase in the offer of testing for exposed and/or symptomatic individuals.

The decrease in incidence at national level may hide a level of heterogeneity in disease incidence at subnational level.

While decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed, Member States are still reporting community transmission.

The information available from sero-epidemiological studies provides an indication that the population immunity is still low (<10%), therefore there is still a risk that susceptible individuals may become infected.

Even though no major increases in disease incidence have been observed in the weeks since the phase-out of non-pharmaceutical interventions began, an associated upsurge may still be anticipated. However, the reestablishment of transmission chains and larger clusters would take a few generations of infection.

The rate at which incidence of COVID-19 cases, and associated hospitalisations and deaths, could increase will depend on the effectiveness of the control measures that remain in place and on the extent to which people change their behaviour in comparison to the pre-COVID-19 era:

If people are more cautious, having learned about the risks of the disease or if they are instructed to change their behaviour (e.g. by wearing masks), the transmission rate would be lower than before measures were introduced.

However, the progressive lifting of the prohibition of mass gatherings may lead to some people meeting in larger numbers.

Furthermore, the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation or ICU care may be lower if older people and those who belong to risk groups restrict their contact rates to a greater extent than the general population following the phasing out of measures.

In summary, the probability of the risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to levels that require stricter response measures, as a consequence of lifting/adjusting community level physical distancing measures ranges from moderate (if measures are phased out gradually, when only sporadic or cluster transmission is reported, and when appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place) to very high (if measures are phased out when there is still ongoing community transmission, and no appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place).

An increase in COVID-19 incidence would be associated with increasing morbidity and mortality, with more severe morbidity and mortality likely if individuals at increased risk of severe outcome are not properly shielded. Such an increase, if not checked rapidly, may place healthcare systems under stress, as was seen in March and April 2020

in several EU/EEA countries and the UK. However, a set of control measures are now known to be effective in checking and reversing the trend towards increasing incidence within a period of about two-to-three weeks.

Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 incidence rising is assessed as moderate.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  All topics: A to Z  Coronavirus  Threats and outbreaks  COVID-19  Assessing the risk to the EU                   COVID-19            Situation updates on COVID-19    Assessing the risk to the EU    Facts    Latest evidence    Surveillance    Testing strategies    Laboratory support    Preparedness    Latest outputs    External resources               Risk assessment on COVID-19, 11 June 2020    Risk assessment      Twitter     Facebook     Linked In     Mail          What is the risk of COVID-19 to the general population as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

Moderate in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.  This assessment is based on the information below:  Decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed and sustained in almost all Member States, but several are still reporting ongoing community transmission:  As of 10 June, 29 EU/EEA countries and the UK had a decreasing 14-day incidence, while the 14-day incidence was at the highest level yet observed in two countries (Poland and Sweden).  Twenty-eight countries are reporting a current 14-day incidence below 20 cases per 100 000 population. In two countries (Portugal and the United Kingdom) the current 14-day incidence remains at a rate between 20 and 100 cases per 100 000 population. In one country (Sweden) the current 14-day incidence is above 100 cases per 100 000 population.  There remains uncertainty as to the extent of viral circulation as there is limited information available on the proportion of community transmission that occurs outside of known transmission chains and/or due to importation across countries.  The implementation of robust response measures in the EU was temporarily associated with an observed decrease in incidence. Although the composition and intensity of implementation varied, all EU/EEA countries and the UK introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (recommended or enforced – refer to Annex 4).

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak, which is phylogenetically in the SARS-CoV clade. The disease associated with the virus is referred to as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As of 11 March 2020, 118 598 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide by more than 100 countries. Since late February, the majority of cases reported are from outside China, with an increasing majority of these reported from EU/EEA countries and the UK.

The Director General of the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.

All EU/EEA countries and the UK are affected, reporting a total of 17 413 cases as of 11 March. Seven hundred and eleven cases reported by EU/EEA countries and the UK have died. Italy represents 58% of the cases (n=10 149) and 88% of the fatalities (n=631). The current pace of the increase in cases in the EU/EEA and the UK mirrors trends seen in China in January-early February and trends seen in Italy in mid-February.

Need for immediate targeted action

In the current situation where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading worldwide and the number of cases in Europe is rising with increasing pace in several affected areas, there is a need for immediate targeted action. The speed with which COVID-19 can cause nationally incapacitating epidemics once transmission within the community is established, indicates that in a few weeks or even days, it is likely that similar situations to those seen in China and Italy may be seen in other EU/EEA countries or the UK.

There are no vaccines available and there is little evidence on the effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents. In addition, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population against the new coronavirus and everyone in the population is assumed to be susceptible. Clinical presentations of COVID-19 range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia; severe disease can lead to death. While the majority of cases (80%) are milder respiratory infections and pneumonias, severe illness and death is more common among the elderly with other chronic underlying conditions, with these risk groups accounting for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to date.

Risk assessment

The risk of severe disease associated with COVID-19 infection for people in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered moderate for the general population and high for older adults and individuals with chronic underlying conditions, based on the probability of community transmission and the impact of the disease.

The risk of healthcare system capacity being exceeded in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is considered high. The impact and risk assessment on health system capacity can be mediated by the application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity measures.

The risk of transmission of COVID-19 in health and social institutions with large vulnerable populations is considered high. The impact of transmission in health and social institutions can be mediated by the application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity.

The EU/EEA and the UK are quickly moving toward a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19. The situation is evolving very quickly and a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential in order to delay transmission, as containing transmission to local epidemics is no longer considered feasible. A rapid shift from a containment to a mitigation approach is required, as the rapid increase in cases, that is anticipated in the coming days to few weeks may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to realise, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time. Measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems.

Necessary measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic

Given the current epidemiology and risk assessment, and the expected developments in the next days to few weeks, the following public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are necessary in EU/EEA countries:

Social distancing measures should be implemented early in order to mitigate the impact of the epidemic and to delay the epidemic peak. This can interrupt human-to-human transmission chains, prevent further spread, reduce the intensity of the epidemic and slow down the increase in cases, while allowing healthcare systems to prepare and cope with an increased influx of patients. Such measures should include: the immediate isolation of symptomatic persons suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19; the suspension of mass gatherings, taking into consideration the size of the event, the density of participants and if the event is in a confined indoor environment; social distancing measures at workplaces (for example teleworking, suspension of meetings, cancellation of non-essential travel); measures in and closure of schools, taking into consideration the uncertainty in the evidence of children in transmitting the disease, need for day care for children, impact on nursing staff, potential to increase transmission to vulnerable grandparents; cordon sanitaire of residential areas with high levels of community transmission.



Ensuring the public is aware of the seriousness of COVID-19. A high degree of population understanding, solidarity and discipline is required to apply strict personal hygiene, coughing etiquette, self-monitoring and social distancing measures. Community engagement and acceptance of stringent social distancing measures put in place are key in delaying and reducing further spread.

Prevention and control of COVID-19 in hospitals and long-term care facilities is an immediate priority in order to: (1) slow the demand for specialised healthcare, such as ICU beds; (2) safeguard populations vulnerable to severe outcomes of infection (3); protect healthcare workers that provide care; (4) minimise the export of cases to other healthcare facilities and the community.

Every healthcare facility should initiate training for all staff and those who may be required for healthcare provision during surge capacity. Countries should identify healthcare units that can be designated to care for COVID-19 cases, to minimise transmission to non-cases and to conserve PPE. Countries and healthcare institutions should identify additional facilities that can be used for the cohorting of cases with mild symptoms, in the event that surge capacity is exceeded by healthcare facilities. The highest priority for use of respirators (FFP2/3) are healthcare workers, in particular those performing aerosol-generating procedures, including swabbing.

If resources or capacity are limited, rational approaches should be implemented to prioritise high-yield actions, which include: rational use of confirmatory testing, reducing contact tracing to focus only on high-yield contacts, rational use of PPE and hospitalisation and implementing rational criteria for de-isolation. Testing approaches should prioritise vulnerable populations, protection of social and healthcare institutions, including staff.

National surveillance systems should initially aim at rapidly detecting cases and assessing community transmission. As the epidemic progresses, surveillance should monitor the intensity, geographical spread and the impact of the epidemic on the population and healthcare systems and assess the effectiveness of measures in place. In circumstances with capacity shortages and strict implementation of social distancing measures, surveillance should focus on severe acute respiratory infections, sentinel surveillance in outpatient clinics or collection of data through telephone helplines.

A strategic approach based on early and rigorous application of these measures will help reduce the burden and pressure on the healthcare system, and in particular on hospitals, and will allow more time for the testing of therapeutics and vaccine development.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  Publications & data  Rapid risk assessment: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK – sixth update                   Publications & data                Rapid risk assessment: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK – sixth update    Risk assessment   12 Mar 2020     Cite:    Citation Link     European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The EU/EEA and the UK are quickly moving toward a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19. The situation is evolving very quickly and a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential in order to delay transmission, as containing transmission to local epidemics is no longer considered feasible. A rapid shift from a containment to a mitigation approach is required, as the rapid increase in cases, that is anticipated in the coming days to few weeks may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to realise, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time. Measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems.  Necessary measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic  Given the current epidemiology and risk assessment, and the expected developments in the next days to few weeks, the following public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are necessary in EU/EEA countries:  Social distancing measures should be implemented early in order to mitigate the impact of the epidemic and to delay the epidemic peak. This can interrupt human-to-human transmission chains, prevent further spread, reduce the intensity of the epidemic and slow down the increase in cases, while allowing healthcare systems to prepare and cope with an increased influx of patients. Such measures should include: the immediate isolation of symptomatic persons suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19;  the suspension of mass gatherings, taking into consideration the size of the event, the density of participants and if the event is in a confined indoor environment;  social distancing measures at workplaces (for example teleworking, suspension of meetings, cancellation of non-essential travel);  measures in and closure of schools, taking into consideration the uncertainty in the evidence of children in transmitting the disease, need for day care for children, impact on nursing staff, potential to increase transmission to vulnerable grandparents;  cordon sanitaire of residential areas with high levels of community transmission.   Ensuring the public is aware of the seriousness of COVID-19. A high degree of population understanding, solidarity and discipline is required to apply strict personal hygiene, coughing etiquette, self-monitoring and social distancing measures. Community engagement and acceptance of stringent social distancing measures put in place are key in delaying and reducing further spread.  Prevention and control of COVID-19 in hospitals and long-term care facilities is an immediate priority in order to: (1) slow the demand for specialised healthcare, such as ICU beds; (2) safeguard populations vulnerable to severe outcomes of infection (3); protect healthcare workers that provide care; (4) minimise the export of cases to other healthcare facilities and the community.  Every healthcare facility should initiate training for all staff and those who may be required for healthcare provision during surge capacity. Countries should identify healthcare units that can be designated to care for COVID-19 cases, to minimise transmission to non-cases and to conserve PPE. Countries and healthcare institutions should identify additional facilities that can be used for the cohorting of cases with mild symptoms, in the event that surge capacity is exceeded by healthcare facilities. The highest priority for use of respirators (FFP2/3) are healthcare workers, in particular those performing aerosol-generating procedures, including swabbing.  If resources or capacity are limited, rational approaches should be implemented to prioritise high-yield actions, which include: rational use of confirmatory testing, reducing contact tracing to focus only on high-yield contacts, rational use of PPE and hospitalisation and implementing rational criteria for de-isolation. Testing approaches should prioritise vulnerable populations, protection of social and healthcare institutions, including staff.  National surveillance systems should initially aim at rapidly detecting cases and assessing community transmission. As the epidemic progresses, surveillance should monitor the intensity, geographical spread and the impact of the epidemic on the population and healthcare systems and assess the effectiveness of measures in place. In circumstances with capacity shortages and strict implementation of social distancing measures, surveillance should focus on severe acute respiratory infections, sentinel surveillance in outpatient clinics or collection of data through telephone helplines.  A strategic approach based on early and rigorous application of these measures will help reduce the burden and pressure on the healthcare system, and in particular on hospitals, and will allow more time for the testing of therapeutics and vaccine development.

4,chance of (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/outbreak-novel-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-situation-italy,"Publication Risk assessment

During the course of the day on 22 February, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy. Initial case identification was based on local laboratory confirmations in the affected Region. Further confirmatory testing is being undertaken by the Italian national reference laboratory and extensive contact tracing is being performed. On 22 February, COVID-19 cases were also reported from two other Regions, Piedmont and Veneto. On 23 February Emilia-Romagna also reported cases. Transmission appears to not be first generation transmission from people travelling or returning from an affected area, but seems to have occurred locally. Transmission events have been reported to have occurred in hospitals, with COVID-19 cases identified among healthcare workers and patients. Two deaths among elderly people have been observed. COVID-19 cases have been identified in multiple

municipalities.

The information currently available about the different COVID-19 clusters of cases in four Regions in Italy is limited. The situation is dynamically evolving, with more cases expected in the coming days. The risk assessment for the EU/EEA might change when more data become available. The clusters are currently limited to a few Regions in northern Italy. No close contacts or other related cases have been reported to be linked to other European countries.

The risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people from the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered to be low to moderate.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

All previously reported cases in the EU/EEA and UK have clearly established epidemiological links; contact tracing measures have been in place to contain further spread. Extraordinary public health measures have been implemented in northern Italy and strong efforts are being made to identify, isolate and test contacts in order to contain the outbreak. The probability of further transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded because a high level of uncertainties with several unpredictable factors and a situation that is still evolving.

The possibility of new introductions from other countries outside China in the EU/EEA appears to be increasing as the number of non EU/EEA countries reporting cases keeps going up. Among the increasing number of countries reporting COVID-19 cases are Israel, Lebanon, Iran, and Egypt, while the number of cases in countries outside of China (South Korea, Japan) has been increasing over the last few days. This also increases the possibility of cases being introduced from other countries outside China by travellers to the EU/EEA.

The impact of sustained transmission in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, given that the reported case severity is high among these groups.

The risk of the occurrence of similar clusters, similar to the ones in Italy, associated with COVID-19 in other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently considered to be moderate to high.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

The current event in Italy indicates that local transmission may have resulted in several clusters for which an epidemiological link to areas where ongoing transmission is presumed, was not apparent. The accumulated evidence from clusters reported in the EU/EEA and the UK indicates that once imported, the virus causing COVID19 can transmit rapidly. This may emanate from cases with mild symptoms that do not provoke healthcare-seeking behaviour. The increases in cases and the number of countries outside China reporting those cases increases the potential routes of importation of the infection into the EU/EEA and the UK.

The impact of such clusters in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially if hospitals were affected and a large number of healthcare workers had to be isolated. The impact on vulnerable groups within affected hospitals or healthcare facilities is considered to be severe, in particular for the elderly.

The rigorous public health measures that were implemented immediately after identifying the Italian COVID-19 cases will reduce the impact of such outbreaks as well as the further spread.

The risk for people from the EU/EEA and the UK travelling/resident in areas with presumed community transmission is currently high.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

The overall number of reported cases in areas with community transmission is high or increasing. However, there are significant uncertainties regarding transmissibility and under-detection, particularly among mild or asymptomatic cases.

For travellers/residents, the impact of one or more infections is considered high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, because the reported case severity is high in these groups. The impact will also depend on the capacity and availability of healthcare during the epidemic.

The risk for healthcare systems capacity in the EU/EEA and the UK during the peak of the influenza season is low to moderate.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

As the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK remains low, the probability of widespread infection remains low during the peak of the 2019–2020 influenza season. The majority of countries reported widespread influenza activity for week 7/2020, but the proportion of specimens tested positive in sentinel surveillance is slightly decreasing; some EU/EEA countries might have already moved past the peak period of high influenza circulation: see https://flunewseurope.org.

If a significant increase in COVID-19 cases were to coincide with a high level of influenza activity, the potential impact on healthcare systems would be moderate to high. The increased number of cases would require additional resources for testing, case management, surveillance, and contact tracing. Increased transmission could result in further pressure on healthcare systems. This situation would be exacerbated should a substantial number of healthcare workers become infected.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  Publications & data  Threat assessment brief: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation in Italy                   Publications & data                Threat assessment brief: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation in Italy    Publication Risk assessment   23 Feb 2020        Twitter     Facebook     Linked In     Mail      During the course of the day on 22 February, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy.

4,chance of (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/man-given-almost-zero-chance-of-covid-19-survival-due-to-return-home,"A woman allowed to see her husband to say goodbye when told he had “almost zero chance” of surviving coronavirus, said he could shortly be home after more than 11 weeks in intensive care, much of it on a ventilator.

Sue Martin, 49, from Cardiff, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that her husband, Mal, 58, had survived against all the odds, but the family was now preparing for the unknown ahead.

Mal, the chairman of a recruitment firm, was admitted to hospital on 29 March. In an interview in April, Sue, a civil servant, told of the emotional moment she and their children Hana, 16, and William, 14, all wearing personal protective equipment, were given 10 minutes to say their goodbyes.

He is now expected to be discharged within days, but the physical toll of the virus could mean that he will lose some fingers, and he may require long-term dialysis.

Doctors were “just completely astounded” at his determination and focus, she said. “Everybody in the hospital has been saying to him they did not expect him to survive. We were told he was slipping away, that he was as close to death as anybody they had seen that had then managed to survive.”

She and the children had discussed his potential funeral. “To think we were at that stage, and it was almost so hopeless, and to now talk about him coming home, well we just can’t believe it. We’re just so incredibly grateful,” she said.

Unable to see him in person, they initially saw him through FaceTime, but stopped because it was too depressing “to see him just lying there, lifeless, and obviously unresponsive”.

When he eventually came out of his coma, “it was a one-way conversation”.

“He was so weak, all he could do was blink, or perhaps raise an eyebrow, or nod. He couldn’t even move his arms, or hands, or legs, in the beginning. He had so much muscle wastage from being on a ventilator for so long.”

After a while, with a voice setting fitted to his tracheotomy, he was able to respond. “The day we were able to hear his voice was just incredible,” she said.

“Every time we see him now, it is more like him, he is just a very thinner, weaker version of himself. He’s just now realising how close he came, and what we went through as well, which is quite difficult I think for him to process.”

Several fingers and his thumbs are “all shrivelled up” as result of medication given to keep him alive. “It’s a small price to pay if he requires some amputations of fingers and thumbs,” she said. He might always suffer from breathlessness, and could require dialysis long term. She has been told his hallucinations may last for years.

“So we will continue to take each day as it comes. Him actually being here physically with us will make a massive difference. And we will just do whatever we need to do to get him to the best place we can get him to.

“But we will all be very different. But hopefully there will be some positives to come from it and we will just continue to be as positive as possible and support him in the best way we can.”","       Skip to main content            The Guardian - Back to home          Support The Guardian  Available for everyone, funded by readers   Contribute       Subscribe       Contribute           Search jobs           Sign in         My account     Account overview    Profile    Emails & marketing    Settings    Help     Comments & replies                 Sign out          Search            switch to the International edition     switch to the UK edition     switch to the US edition     switch to the Australia edition     current edition: International edition     News    Opinion    Sport    Culture    Lifestyle          Show More          News    Coronavirus    World news    UK news    Environment    Science    Global development    Football    Tech    Business    Obituaries       Opinion    The Guardian view    Columnists    Cartoons    Opinion videos    Letters       Sport    Football    Cricket    Rugby union    Tennis    Cycling    F1    Golf    US sports       Culture    Books    Music    TV & radio    Art & design    Film    Games    Classical    Stage       Lifestyle    Fashion    Food    Recipes    Love & sex    Health & fitness    Home & garden    Women    Men    Family    Travel    Money               What term do you want to search?

He had so much muscle wastage from being on a ventilator for so long.”  After a while, with a voice setting fitted to his tracheotomy, he was able to respond. “The day we were able to hear his voice was just incredible,” she said.  “Every time we see him now, it is more like him, he is just a very thinner, weaker version of himself. He’s just now realising how close he came, and what we went through as well, which is quite difficult I think for him to process.”  Several fingers and his thumbs are “all shrivelled up” as result of medication given to keep him alive. “It’s a small price to pay if he requires some amputations of fingers and thumbs,” she said. He might always suffer from breathlessness, and could require dialysis long term. She has been told his hallucinations may last for years.     “So we will continue to take each day as it comes. Him actually being here physically with us will make a massive difference. And we will just do whatever we need to do to get him to the best place we can get him to.  “But we will all be very different.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

None selected Select countries  Case fatality rate In this section How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time? The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

Last updated: May 14, 22:00 GMT See also: Death Rate by Age and Sex of COVID-19 patients



Introduction

When calculating the mortality rate, we need:

The number of actual cases. We need to know the number of actual cases (not merely the reported ones, which are typically only a small portion of the actual ones) that have already had an outcome (positive or negative: recovery or death), not the current cases that still have to resolve (the case sample shall contain zero active cases and include only ""closed"" cases). The number of actual deaths related to the closed cases examined above.

Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case. The number of actual cases is therefore estimated to be at several multiples above the number of reported cases. The number of deaths also tends to be underestimated, as some patients are not hospitalized and not tested.

If we base our calculation (deaths / cases) on the number of reported cases (rather than on the actual ones), we will greatly overestimate the fatality rate.

Fatality Rate based on New York City Actual Cases and Deaths

Worldometer has analyzed the data provided by New York City, the New York State antibody study, and the excess deaths analysis by the CDC. Combining these 3 sources together we can derive the most accurate estimate to date on the mortality rate for COVID-19, as well as the mortality rate by age group and underlying condition. These findings can be valid for New York City and not necessarily for other places (suburban or rural areas, other countries, etc.), but they represent the best estimates to date given the co-occurrence of these 3 studies.

Actual Cases (1.7 million: 10 times the number of confirmed cases)

New York State conducted an antibody testing study [source], showing that 12.3% of the population in the state had COVID-19 antibodies as of May 1, 2020. The survey developed a baseline infection rate by testing 15,103 people at grocery stores and community centers across the state over the preceding two weeks. The study provides a breakdown by county, race (White 7%, Asian 11.1%, multi/none/other 14.4%, Black 17.4%, Latino/Hispanic 25.4%), and age, among other variables. 19.9% of the population of New York City had COVID-19 antibodies. With a population of 8,398,748 people in NYC [source], this percentage would indicate that 1,671,351 people had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had recovered as of May 1 in New York City. The number of confirmed cases reported as of May 1 by New York City was 166,883 [source], more than 10 times less.

Actual Deaths (23,000: almost twice the number of confirmed deaths)

As of May 1, New York City reported 13,156 confirmed deaths and 5,126 probable deaths (deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate but no laboratory test performed), for a total of 18,282 deaths [source]. The CDC on May 11 released its ""Preliminary Estimate of Excess Mortality During the COVID-19 Outbreak — New York City, March 11–May 2, 2020"" [source] in which it calculated an estimate of actual COVID-19 deaths in NYC by analyzing the ""excess deaths"" (defined as ""the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death"") and found that, in addition to the confirmed and probable deaths reported by the city, there were an estimated 5,293 more deaths to be attributed. After adjusting for the previous day (May 1), we get 5,148 additional deaths, for a total of actual deaths of 13,156 confirmed + 5,126 probable + 5,148 additional excess deaths calculated by CDC = 23,430 actual COVID-19 deaths as of May 1, 2020 in New York City.

Infection Fatality Rate (23k / 1.7M = 1.4% IFR)

Actual Cases with an outcome as of May 1 = estimated actual recovered (1,671,351) + estimated actual deaths (23,430) = 1,694,781.

Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) = Deaths / Cases = 23,430 / 1,694,781 = 1.4% (1.4% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a fatal outcome, while 98.6% recover).

Mortality Rate (23k / 8.4M = 0.28% CMR to date) and Probability of Dying

As of May 1, 23,430 people are estimated to have died out of a total population of 8,398,748 in New York City. This corresponds to a 0.28% crude mortality rate to date, or 279 deaths per 100,000 population, or 1 death every 358 people. Note that the Crude Mortality Rate will continue to increase as more infections and deaths occur (see notes under the paragraph ""Herd Immunity"" below for details).

Mortality Rate by Age

See also: Death Rate by Age and Sex of COVID-19 patients

When analyzing the breakdown of deaths by age and condition [source], we can observe how, out of 15,230 confirmed deaths in New York City up to May 12, only 690 (4.5% of all deaths) occurred in patients under the age of 65 who did not have an underlying medical condition (or for which it is unknown whether they had or did not have an underlying condition).

Underlying illnesses include Diabetes, Lung Disease, Cancer, Immunodeficiency, Heart Disease, Hypertension, Asthma, Kidney Disease, GI/Liver Disease, and Obesity [source]

Under 65-year-old (0.09% CMR to date)

85.9% of the population (7,214,525 people out of 8,398,748) in New York City is under 65 years old according to the US Census Bureau, which indicates the percent of persons 65 years old and over in New York City as being 14.1% [source].

We don't know what percentage of the population in this age group has an underlying condition, so at this time we are not able to accurately estimate the fatality rate for the under 65 years old and healthy.

But we can calculate it for the entire population under 65 years old (both healthy and unhealthy): with 6,188 deaths (26% of the total deaths in all age groups) occurring in this age group, of which 5,498 deaths (89%) in patients with a known underlying condition, the crude mortality rate to date will correspond to 6,188 / 7,214,525 = 0.09% CMR, or 86 deaths per 100,000 population (compared to 0.28% and 279 deaths per 100,000 for the general population).

So far there has been 1 death every 1,166 people under 65 years old (compared to 1 death every 358 people in the general population). And 89% of the times, the person who died had one or more underlying medical conditions.

NOTE: We are gathering and analyzing additional data in order to provide more estimates by age group.

Herd Immunity and final Crude Mortality Rate

Crude mortality rate is not really applicable during an ongoing epidemic.

And to reach herd immunity for COVID-19 and effectively end the epidemic, approximately two thirds (67%) of the population would need to be infected. As of May 1, New York City is at 20%, based on the antibody study findings.

Therefore, the crude mortality rate has the potential to more than triple from our current estimate, reaching close to 1,000 deaths per 100,000 population (1% CMR), and close to 300 per 100,000 (0.3% CMR) in the population under 65 years old, with 89% of these deaths (267 out of 300) occurring in people with a known underlying medical condition (including obesity).



Historical Account of the Initial Estimates

3.4% Mortality Rate estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of March 3

In his opening remarks at the March 3 media briefing on Covid-19, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated:

“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.” [13]

Initial estimate was 2%

Initially, the World Health Organization (WHO) had mentioned 2% as a mortality rate estimate in a press conference on Wednesday, January 29 [1][2] and again on February 10. However, on January 29 WHO specified that this was a very early and provisional estimate that might have changed. Surveillance was increasing, within China but also globally, but at the time it was said that:

We don't know how many were infected (""When you look at how many people have died, you need to look at how many people where infected, and right now we don't know that number. So it is early to put a percentage on that.""[1][2]). The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO. It is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be for the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization [1][2].

Mortality Rate as of Feb. 20 in China (findings from the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission)

The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission published on Feb. 28 by WHO [12] is based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases. The report notes that ""The Joint Mission acknowledges the known challenges and biases of reporting crude CFR early in an epidemic"" (see also our discussion on: How to calculate the mortality rate during an outbreak). Here are its findings on Case Fatality Ratio, or CFR:

""As of 20 February, 2,114 of the 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases have died (crude fatality ratio [CFR: 3.8%) (note: at least some of whom were identified using a case definition that included pulmonary disease).

The overall CFR varies by location and intensity of transmission (i.e. 5.8% in Wuhan vs. 0.7% in other areas in China).

In China, the overall CFR was higher in the early stages of the outbreak (17.3% for cases with symptom onset from 1-10 January) and has reduced over time to 0.7% for patients with symptom onset after 1 February. "" [12]

The Joint Mission noted that the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak.

Mortality Rate, as discussed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China on Feb. 4

Asked at a press conference on February 4 what the current mortality rate (or case fatality rate, CFR) is, an official with China NHC said that [7]:

The formula they are using is: cumulative current total deaths / current confirmed cases . Therefore, as of 24:00 on Feb. 3, the formula used was 425/20,438.

. Therefore, as of 24:00 on Feb. 3, the formula used was 425/20,438. Based on this figure, the national mortality rate to date was 2.1% of confirmed cases.

There might be mild cases and other cases not reported.

97% of the country's total deaths (414) were in the Hubei Province.

Mortality rate in Wuhan was 4.9% .

. Mortality rate in the Hubei Province was 3.1%.

Mortality rate nationwide was 2.1% .

. Fatality rate in other provinces was 0.16%.

Deaths in Wuhan were 313, accounting for 74% of China's total.

Most of the cases were still mild cases, therefore there was no need to panic.

Asked why Wuhan was so much higher than the national level, the NHC official replied that it was for lack of resources, citing as an example that there were only 110 critical care beds in the three designated hospitals where most of the cases were sent.

National mortality rate was basically stable, as of Feb. 4 at 2.1%, and it was 2.3% at the beginning of the epidemic, which can be seen as a slight decline.

Front the analysis of death cases, it emerged that the demographic profile was mainly male, accounting for 2/3 , females accounting for 1/3, and is mainly elderly, more than 80% are elderly over 60 years old , and more than 75% had underlying diseases present such as cardiovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and, in some cases, tumor.

, females accounting for 1/3, and is mainly elderly, , and more than 75% had underlying diseases present such as cardiovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and, in some cases, tumor. Elderly people with basic diseases, as long as they have pneumonia, were clinically a high-risk factor regardless of whether it is a coronavirus or not, and the case fatality rate was also very high, so it is not that the case fatality rate of pneumonia is high because of the infection with the new coronavirus. ""This point must be explained to everyone,"" concluded the NHC official.[7]

Preliminary study providing a tentative 3% estimate for case fatality rate

A preliminary study published on The Lancet on January 24 [3] provided an early estimation of 3% for the overall case fatality rate. Below we show an extract (highlights added for the relevant data and observations):

Of the 41 patients in this cohort, 22 (55%) developed severe dyspnoea and 13 (32%) required admission to an intensive care unit, and six died. Hence, the case-fatality proportion in this cohort is approximately 14.6%, and the overall case fatality proportion appears to be closer to 3%. However, both of these estimates should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease. Nevertheless, the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have had a case-fatality ratio of less than 5% but had an enormous impact due to widespread transmission, so there is no room for complacency.

Fatality rate can also change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists.

Death rate among patients admitted to hospital

A study on 138 hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection, published on February 7 on JAMA, found that 26% of patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4.3% died, but a number of patients were still hospitalized at the time. [9]

A previous study had found that, out of 41 admitted hospital patients, 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.[5]

Days from first symptom to death

The Wang et al. February 7 study published on JAMA found that the median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.[9]

Previously. the China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm 22 Jan 2020. A study of these cases found that the median days from first symptom to death were 14 (range 6-41) days, and tended to be shorter among people of 70 year old or above (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those with ages below 70 year old (20 [range 10-41] days.[6]

Median Hospital Stay

The JANA study found that, among those discharged alive, the median hospital stay was 10 days.[9]

Comparison with other viruses

For comparison, the case fatality rate with seasonal flu in the United States is less than 0.1% (1 death per every 1,000 cases).

Mortality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%.

*estimate

How to calculate the mortality rate during an outbreak

At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude [...]



A precise estimate of the case fatality rate is therefore impossible at present.

2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): estimating the case fatality rate – a word of caution - Battegay Manue et al., Swiss Med Wkly, February 7, 2020

The case fatality rate (CFR) represents the proportion of cases who eventually die from a disease.

Once an epidemic has ended, it is calculated with the formula: deaths / cases.

But while an epidemic is still ongoing, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak, this formula is, at the very least, ""naïve"" and can be ""misleading if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients."" [8]

In other words, current deaths belong to a total case figure of the past, not to the current case figure in which the outcome (recovery or death) of a proportion (the most recent cases) hasn't yet been determined.

The correct formula, therefore, would appear to be:

CFR = deaths at day.x / cases at day.x-{T}

(where T = average time period from case confirmation to death)

This would constitute a fair attempt to use values for cases and deaths belonging to the same group of patients.

One issue can be that of determining whether there is enough data to estimate T with any precision, but it is certainly not T = 0 (what is implicitly used when applying the formula current deaths / current cases to determine CFR during an ongoing outbreak).

Let's take, for example, the data at the end of February 8, 2020: 813 deaths (cumulative total) and 37,552 cases (cumulative total) worldwide.

If we use the formula (deaths / cases) we get:

813 / 37,552 = 2.2% CFR (flawed formula).

With a conservative estimate of T = 7 days as the average period from case confirmation to death, we would correct the above formula by using February 1 cumulative cases, which were 14,381, in the denominator:

Feb. 8 deaths / Feb. 1 cases = 813 / 14,381 = 5.7% CFR (correct formula, and estimating T=7).

T could be estimated by simply looking at the value of (current total deaths + current total recovered) and pair it with a case total in the past that has the same value. For the above formula, the matching dates would be January 26/27, providing an estimate for T of 12 to 13 days. This method of estimating T uses the same logic of the following method, and therefore will yield the same result.

An alternative method, which has the advantage of not having to estimate a variable, and that is mentioned in the American Journal of Epidemiology study cited previously as a simple method that nevertheless could work reasonably well if the hazards of death and recovery at any time t measured from admission to the hospital, conditional on an event occurring at time t, are proportional, would be to use the formula:

CFR = deaths / (deaths + recovered)

which, with the latest data available, would be equal to:

524,881 / (524,881 + 6,178,566) = 8% CFR (worldwide)

If we now exclude cases in mainland China, using current data on deaths and recovered cases, we get:

520,247 / (520,247 + 6,100,067) = 7.9% CFR (outside of mainland China)

The sample size above is limited, and the data could be inaccurate (for example, the number of recoveries in countries outside of China could be lagging in our collection of data from numerous sources, whereas the number of cases and deaths is more readily available and therefore generally more up to par).

There was a discrepancy in mortality rates (with a much higher mortality rate in China) which however is not being confirmed as the sample of cases outside of China is growing in size. On the contrary, it is now higher outside of China than within.

That initial discrepancy was generally explained with a higher case detection rate outside of China especially with respect to Wuhan, where priority had to be initially placed on severe and critical cases, given the ongoing emergency.

Unreported cases would have the effect of decreasing the denominator and inflating the CFR above its real value. For example, assuming 10,000 total unreported cases in Wuhan and adding them back to the formula, we would get a CFR of 7.8% (quite different from the CFR of 8% based strictly on confirmed cases).

Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College in the UK, said his “best guess” was that there were 100,000 affected by the virus even though there were only 2,000 confirmed cases at the time. [11]

Without going that far, the possibility of a non negligible number of unreported cases in the initial stages of the crisis should be taken into account when trying to calculate the case fatally rate.

As the days go by and the city organized its efforts and built the infrastructure, the ability to detect and confirm cases improved. As of February 3, for example, the novel coronavirus nucleic acid testing capability of Wuhan had increased to 4,196 samples per day from an initial 200 samples.[10]

A significant discrepancy in case mortality rate can also be observed when comparing mortality rates as calculated and reported by China NHC: a CFR of 3.1% in the Hubei province (where Wuhan, with the vast majority of deaths is situated), and a CFR of 0.16% in other provinces (19 times less).

Finally, we shall remember that while the 2003 SARS epidemic was still ongoing, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a fatality rate of 4% (or as low as 3%), whereas the final case fatality rate ended up being 9.6%.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

A novel coronavirus emerging in China—key questions for impact assessment . New England Journal of Medicine , 382 (8), 692-694. The US flu data is sourced from the US CDC. Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

Only up to a point. Surveys of the American public reveal that attitudes towards the same fatal virus in the same nation are strongly influenced by partisan voting patterns. Republican voters are generally less concerned than Democrats about Covid-19, and less likely to support public lockdown measures to prevent spread of the coronavirus, which at the time of publishing had infected over a million Americans and killed more than 69,000 people there.

Since Covid-19 is an infectious disease, it depends entirely on human hosts to carry and spread it – the more people act as regular socialising humans, the more chances the virus has to replicate and spread, and the worse the epidemic. That’s the science. Only by recognising the threat of the disease, will people be mobilised to change their innate social behaviours, to actively slow its spread. However, while scientific and medical experts in the US and around the world alert the public to the risks, and reiterate the importance of social distancing, several global leaders, with no scientific training, have spent months playing down the risks.

Protective movement restrictions have nevertheless been ordered by most state governments, with resulting business shutdowns and record unemployment. In response, more than a dozen states have seen anti-lockdown protests, as thousands of conservative and far-right Americans demand the restrictions are lifted, in spite of the health costs.

Michigan has been one of the state’s hardest hit by the virus and is still experiencing more than 100 daily deaths. On 1 May, the day after this Capitol protest, during which demonstrators called the Michigan Governor a tyrant and compared her to Hitler, Trump described those same protestors as “very good people”. Meanwhile, all over the US, anti-lockdown protests continue . Political beliefs and levels of concern about the outbreak are closely tied together (Credit: Getty Images) These protests, which contradict health advice to reduce transmission rates of the virus, come at a time of widely circulated conspiracy theories about the virus , including that it is a hoax ( believed by 13% of Americans polled ), or that the virus was deliberately created in a Chinese weapons lab (a claim believed by as much as half the population), and that 5G wireless technology somehow spreads the virus. Such theories have been boosted and spread by a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far-right activists, including Republican Senator Tom Cotton. And research shows that even smart people can believe such conspiracy theories , if they’re couched in the right language .  “If you have the kind of hyper-partisanship we have in the United States, it’s like a dry forest and all it’ll take is one match to light it and cause a problem,” says Jay van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University. “That’s what we’ve seen in the last few months in the US, where Trump didn’t take the virus seriously at first, and the right-wing media sphere – Fox News and talk radio – downplayed the threat of the pandemic for a long time to protect his electoral chances. So then you have the recipe for differences in beliefs.”  As polls have shown, as far back as February, Americans’ attitudes to Covid-19 risk are closely tied to voting behaviour , with Republicans showing much less concern about the outbreak.  Tribal culture affects how people see the world more than facts do. Take human-caused climate change, for which there is near-unanimous global scientific consensus. This, too, divides Americans, but in an unlikely way: the more education that Democrats and Republicans have, the more their beliefs in climate change diverge. Of Republicans with only a high school education, 23% report being very worried about climate change. But among college-educated Republicans, that figure was just 8% .  This may seem counter-intuitive, because better-educated Republicans are more likely to be aware of the scientific consensus. But in the realm of public opinion, climate change isn’t a scientific issue, it’s a political one. Climate change science is relatively new and technically complicated, and many Americans adopt the opinions of their tribal leaders: the political elites. Even though better-educated Republicans may have more exposure to information about the science around climate change, they also have more exposure to partisan messages about it, and this matters more. Most protestors are concerned about the economic effects of an extended period of lockdown (Credit: Getty Images) “We’ve had three years of Americans arguing about different perceptions around facts: say, the size of crowds at Trump’s inauguration versus Obama’s inauguration. It’s easy to laugh that off, because it doesn’t have any consequences. But now we have a virus that imposes enormous risks to people’s health,” van Bavel says. “And the risks have non-partisan consequences because most people have a family member or work with someone who’s from a different political party. If they get exposed to the virus and contract the disease, they put you at risk. So there is a very strong reason to try to figure out a way to solve this.”  Since we have culturally evolved to acquire our knowledge and beliefs primarily through high-fidelity copying of others rather than by invention (by looking at the evidence and deciding for ourselves), we are vulnerable to this problem of copying unreliable models. Worse still, because we have culturally learned to value rational explanations over subjective ones for scientific issues, we can be manipulated into believing the opinions we copy are rational, so it is harder to change them.  Despite our culturally evolved norms for rationality and evidence-based decision making, our biological evolution has not caught up and our cognition continues to be emotionally led. The problem is not necessarily that we use the emotive part of our brain more than the rational in decision making, but that we are self-delusional. Even experts are prone to biases and these mean costly mistakes are made, and irrational prejudices are systemic in organisations where people believe themselves to be non-racist, non-sexist and to hold the positions they do through skill rather than luck .  Often, the main role of reasoning in decision making is actually not to arrive at the decision but to be able to present the decision as something that’s rational. Some psychologists believe we only use reason to retrospectively justify our decisions, and largely rely on unquestioned instincts to make choices. It may be that our unconscious instincts – despite our cognitive biases and prejudices – are more capable of rationality than our logical thought-processing minds. Few of us are able to fully separate our subjective and objective reasoning during decision making – this is one of the promises of artificial intelligence. Nurses in PPE have started standing in front of crowds during recent rallies in the US as a way of challenging their protests (Credit: Getty Images) Our decision making is influenced by our biology and our social environment. Take the psychological and physiological influence of fear: it’s been shown that people who vote more conservatively tend to have a bigger amygdala , the brain’s fear centre. In one study, the more fear a three- or four-year-old showed during a lab study , the more conservative their political attitude was found to be 20 years later .  The impact of fear is instant: when people with liberal attitudes experienced physical threat, during a study, their political and social attitudes became more conservative , temporarily. Conservative politicians and electioneering exploit this, aiming to raise voters’ fears of immigration by comparing immigrants to germs, for example, which targets our deep, biologically evolved motivations to avoid contamination and disease . In one study, during an H1N1 flu epidemic, researchers reminded people of the dangers of the flu virus and then asked them their attitudes towards immigration, after which they were asked whether they had been vaccinated against flu yet. Those who hadn’t received their anti-flu shot were more likely to be anti-immigration than the ones who felt less threatened .  But in a follow-up study, the researchers offered people a squirt of hand sanitiser straight after the flu warning. The immigration bias went away. Making people feel safe changes their voting decision to more liberal . When researchers asked people to imagine themselves completely invulnerable to any harm, Republican voters became significantly more liberal in social attitudes to issues like abortion and immigration. Reason is suffused with emotion.  The social implications of most decisions are also important factors in decision making. In very partisan situations, people who disobey the social norm by voting against the group majority risk ostracism. In such cases, therefore, it may be more rational for the individual to go against the evidence because we are motivated more by social cohesion and maintaining support networks than being objectively right. The social situation in which we find ourselves has an important bearing on the decisions we make (Credit: Getty Images) Whatever your political persuasion, the Covid-19 virus will not discriminate as it seeks more lungs to infect. But, because contagion is inherently social, it may well turn out that those populations who continue to socialise undeterred might end up experiencing worse epidemics. In other words, your voting record may well influence your fate.  Needless to say, these overall trends linking political leanings and attitudes towards coronavirus are not the whole story. Rand Paul, junior Senator from Kentucky, for example, has been volunteering in a hospital to help patients during the crisis, including those with coronavirus, after he had the disease himself.  And there are signs things are changing. As Republicans get exposed to people they know affected by the virus, they are taking the threat more seriously – something known as the “reality constraint”. “People’s motivations for partisanship start to get outweighed by the value of being accurate and being healthy for themselves and their family,” says van Bavel.  The most recent poll shows that over 95% of Democrats support social distancing measures, and a large majority of of Republicans do too – over 80% – so the gap is narrowing. Perhaps, then, it is unsurprising that Trump’s approval rating has declined over the same time that approval ratings have risen for state governors who have shown leadership in responding to the virus.

6,(rational|irrational) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world,"Needless to say, Chenoweth’s research builds on the philosophies of many influential figures throughout history. The African-American abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony, the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi and the US civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King have all convincingly argued for the power of peaceful protest.

Yet Chenoweth admits that when she first began her research in the mid-2000s, she was initially rather cynical of the idea that nonviolent actions could be more powerful than armed conflict in most situations. As a PhD student at the University of Colorado, she had spent years studying the factors contributing to the rise of terrorism when she was asked to attend an academic workshop organised by the International Center of Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC), a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC. The workshop presented many compelling examples of peaceful protests bringing about lasting political change – including, for instance, the People Power protests in the Philippines.

But Chenoweth was surprised to find that no-one had comprehensively compared the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests; perhaps the case studies were simply chosen through some kind of confirmation bias. “I was really motivated by some scepticism that nonviolent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major transformations in society,” she says

Working with Maria Stephan, a researcher at the ICNC, Chenoweth performed an extensive review of the literature on civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006 – a data set then corroborated with other experts in the field. They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change. A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the destruction of infrastructure – or any other physical harm to people or property.

“We were trying to apply a pretty hard test to nonviolent resistance as a strategy,” Chenoweth says. (The criteria were so strict that India’s independence movement was not considered as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in Chenoweth and Stephan’s analysis – since Britain’s dwindling military resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the protests themselves were also a huge influence.)

By the end of this process, they had collected data from 323 violent and nonviolent campaigns. And their results – which were published in their book Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict – were striking.

Strength in numbers

Overall, nonviolent campaigns were twice as likely to succeed as violent campaigns: they led to political change 53% of the time compared to 26% for the violent protests.

This was partly the result of strength in numbers. Chenoweth argues that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to succeed because they can recruit many more participants from a much broader demographic, which can cause severe disruption that paralyses normal urban life and the functioning of society.

In fact, of the 25 largest campaigns that they studied, 20 were nonviolent, and 14 of these were outright successes. Overall, the nonviolent campaigns attracted around four times as many participants (200,000) as the average violent campaign (50,000).

The People Power campaign against the Marcos regime in the Philippines, for instance, attracted two million participants at its height, while the Brazilian uprising in 1984 and 1985 attracted one million, and the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in 1989 attracted 500,000 participants.","      Homepage Accessibility links Skip to content Accessibility Help  BBC Account Notifications  Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Menu Search Search the BBC Search the BBC    Menu  Loading  In Depth | Politics  The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world  Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Linkedin Bookmark this article By David Robson  14th May 2019   Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts – and those engaging a threshold of 3.5% of the population have never failed to bring about change.  I In 1986, millions of Filipinos took to the streets of Manila in peaceful protest and prayer in the People Power movement . The Marcos regime folded on the fourth day.  In 2003, the people of Georgia ousted Eduard Shevardnadze through the bloodless Rose Revolution, in which protestors stormed the parliament building holding the flowers in their hands. While in 2019, the presidents of Sudan and Algeria both announced they would step aside after decades in office, thanks to peaceful campaigns of resistance .

There are, of course, many ethical reasons to use nonviolent strategies. But compelling research by Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, confirms that civil disobedience is not only the moral choice; it is also the most powerful way of shaping world politics – by a long way.  Looking at hundreds of campaigns over the last century, Chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns are twice as likely to achieve their goals as violent campaigns. And although the exact dynamics will depend on many factors, she has shown it takes around 3.5% of the population actively participating in the protests to ensure serious political change .  Chenoweth’s influence can be seen in the recent Extinction Rebellion protests, whose founders say they have been directly inspired by her findings . So just how did she come to these conclusions?

They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change. A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the destruction of infrastructure – or any other physical harm to people or property.  “We were trying to apply a pretty hard test to nonviolent resistance as a strategy,” Chenoweth says. (The criteria were so strict that India’s independence movement was not considered as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in Chenoweth and Stephan’s analysis – since Britain’s dwindling military resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the protests themselves were also a huge influence.)  By the end of this process, they had collected data from 323 violent and nonviolent campaigns. And their results – which were published in their book Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict – were striking.  Strength in numbers  Overall, nonviolent campaigns were twice as likely to succeed as violent campaigns: they led to political change 53% of the time compared to 26% for the violent protests .  This was partly the result of strength in numbers. Chenoweth argues that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to succeed because they can recruit many more participants from a much broader demographic, which can cause severe disruption that paralyses normal urban life and the functioning of society.  In fact, of the 25 largest campaigns that they studied, 20 were nonviolent, and 14 of these were outright successes. Overall, the nonviolent campaigns attracted around four times as many participants (200,000) as the average violent campaign (50,000).  The People Power campaign against the Marcos regime in the Philippines, for instance, attracted two million participants at its height, while the Brazilian uprising in 1984 and 1985 attracted one million, and the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in 1989 attracted 500,000 participants. Having attracted millions of supporters, the People Power demonstrations removed the Marcos regime in the Phillipines (Credit: Getty Images) “Numbers really matter for building power in ways that can really pose a serious challenge or threat to entrenched authorities or occupations,” Chenoweth says – and nonviolent protest seems to be the best way to get that widespread support. Once around 3.5% of the whole population has begun to participate actively, success appears to be inevitable. Besides the People Power movement, the Singing Revolution in Estonia and the Rose Revolution in Georgia all reached the 3.5% threshold “There weren’t any campaigns that had failed after they had achieved 3.5% participation during a peak event,” says Chenoweth – a phenomenon she has called the “3.5% rule”. Besides the People Power movement, that included the Singing Revolution in Estonia in the late 1980s and the Rose Revolution in Georgia in the early 2003. Chenoweth admits that she was initially surprised by her results. But she now cites many reasons that nonviolent protests can garner such high levels of support. Perhaps most obviously, violent protests necessarily exclude people who abhor and fear bloodshed, whereas peaceful protesters maintain the moral high ground. Chenoweth points out that nonviolent protests also have fewer physical barriers to participation. You do not need to be fit and healthy to engage in a strike, whereas violent campaigns tend to lean on the support of physically fit young men. And while many forms of nonviolent protests also carry serious risks – just think of China’s response in Tiananmen Square in 1989 – Chenoweth argues that nonviolent campaigns are generally easier to discuss openly, which means that news of their occurrence can reach a wider audience. Violent movements, on the other hand, require a supply of weapons, and tend to rely on more secretive underground operations that might struggle to reach the general population. An elderly woman talks to the Algerian security forces during the recent protests (Credit: Getty Images) By engaging broad support across the population, nonviolent campaigns are also more likely to win support among the police and the military – the very groups that the government should be leaning on to bring about order. During a peaceful street protest of millions of people, the members of the security forces may also be more likely to fear that their family members or friends are in the crowd – meaning that they fail to crack down on the movement. “Or when they’re looking at the [sheer] numbers of people involved, they may just come to the conclusion the ship has sailed, and they don’t want to go down with the ship,” Chenoweth says. In terms of the specific strategies that are used, general strikes “are probably one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, single method of nonviolent resistance”, Chenoweth says. But they do come at a personal cost, whereas other forms of protest can be completely anonymous. She points to the consumer boycotts in apartheid-era South Africa , in which many black citizens refused to buy products from companies with white owners. The result was an economic crisis among the country’s white elite that contributed to the end of segregation in the early 1990s. Nonviolent protests are more likely to attract support from across society. Here a pro-reform protestor faces security forces in Morocco in 2011 (Credit: Getty Images) “There are more options for engaging and nonviolent resistance that don’t place people in as much physical danger, particularly as the numbers grow, compared to armed activity,” Chenoweth says. “And the techniques of nonviolent resistance are often more visible, so that it's easier for people to find out how to participate directly, and how to coordinate their activities for maximum disruption.” A magic number? These are very general patterns, of course, and despite being twice as successful as the violent conflicts, peaceful resistance still failed 47% of the time. As Chenoweth and Stephan pointed out in their book, that’s sometimes because they never really gained enough support or momentum to “erode the power base of the adversary and maintain resilience in the face of repression”. But some relatively large nonviolent protests also failed, such as the protests against the communist party in East Germany in the 1950s, which attracted 400,000 members (around 2% of the population) at their peak, but still failed to bring about change. In Chenoweth’s data set, it was only once the nonviolent protests had achieved that 3.5% threshold of active engagement that success seemed to be guaranteed – and raising even that level of support is no mean feat. In the UK it would amount to 2.3 million people actively engaging in a movement (roughly twice the size of Birmingham, the UK’s second largest city); in the US, it would involve 11 million citizens – more than the total population of New York City. The fact remains, however, that nonviolent campaigns are the only reliable way of maintaining that kind of engagement. A couple commemorate the Velvet Revolution of 1989, which helped bring down Communist rule in Czechoslovakia - another example of Chenoweth's ""3.5% rule"" (Credit: Getty Images) Chenoweth and Stephan’s initial study was first published in 2011 and their findings have attracted a lot of attention since. “It’s hard to overstate how influential they have been to this body of research,” says Matthew Chandler, who researches civil resistance at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.  Isabel Bramsen, who studies international conflict at the University of Copenhagen agrees that Chenoweth and Stephan’s results are compelling. “It’s [now] an established truth within the field that the nonviolent approaches are much more likely to succeed than violent ones,” she says.  Regarding the “3.5% rule”, she points out that while 3.5% is a small minority, such a level of active participation probably means many more people tacitly agree with the cause.  These researchers are now looking to further untangle the factors that may lead to a movement’s success or failure. Bramsen and Chandler, for instance, both emphasise the importance of unity among demonstrators.  As an example, Bramsen points to the failed uprising in Bahrain in 2011 . The campaign initially engaged many protestors, but quickly split into competing factions. The resulting loss of cohesion, Bramsen thinks, ultimately prevented the movement from gaining enough momentum to bring about change.  Chenoweth’s interest has recently focused on protests closer to home – like the Black Lives Matter movement and the Women’s March in 2017. She is also interested in Extinction Rebellion, recently popularised by the involvement of the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. “They are up against a lot of inertia,” she says. “But I think that they have an incredibly thoughtful and strategic core. And they seem to have all the right instincts about how to develop and teach through a nonviolent resistance campaigns.”  Ultimately, she would like our history books to pay greater attention to nonviolent campaigns rather than concentrating so heavily on warfare. “So many of the histories that we tell one another focus on violence – and even if it is a total disaster, we still find a way to find victories within it,” she says. Yet we tend to ignore the success of peaceful protest, she says.  “Ordinary people, all the time, are engaging in pretty heroic activities that are actually changing the way the world – and those deserve some notice and celebration as well.”  David Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

They may think that if there’s any truth to the information, it could be helpful to friends and followers, and if it isn’t true, it’s harmless – so the impetus is to share it, not realising that sharing causes harm too.

Whether it’s promises of a homemade remedy or claims about some kind of dark government cover-up, the promise of eliciting a strong response in their followers distracts people from the obvious question.

This question should be, of course: is it true?

Override reactions

Classic psychological research shows that some people are naturally better at overriding their reflexive responses than others. This finding may help us understand why some people are more susceptible to fake news than others.

Researchers like Pennycook use a tool called the “cognitive reflection test” or CRT to measure this tendency. To understand how it works, consider the following question:

Emily’s father has three daughters. The first two are named April and May. What is the third daughter’s name?

Did you answer June? That’s the intuitive answer that many people give – but the correct answer is, of course, Emily.

To come to that solution, you need to pause and override that initial gut response. For this reason, CRT questions are not so much a test of raw intelligence, as a test of someone’s tendency to employ their intelligence by thinking things through in a deliberative, analytical fashion, rather than going with your initial intuitions. The people who don’t do this are often called “cognitive misers” by psychologists, since they may be in possession of substantial mental reserves, but they don’t “spend” them.

Cognitive miserliness renders us susceptible to many cognitive biases, and it also seems to change the way we consume information (and misinformation).","      Homepage Accessibility links Skip to content Accessibility Help  BBC Account Notifications  Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Menu Search Search the BBC Search the BBC    Menu  Loading  Covid-19  Why smart people believe coronavirus myths  Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Linkedin Bookmark this article By David Robson  7th April 2020   From students to politicians, many smart people have fallen for dangerous lies spread about the new coronavirus. Why? And how can you protect yourself from misinformation?   It is a sad truth that any health crisis will spawn its own pandemic of misinformation .  In the 80s, 90s, and 2000s we saw the spread of dangerous lies about Aids – from the belief that the HIV virus was created by a government laboratory to the idea that the HIV tests were unreliable , and even the spectacularly unfounded theory that it could be treated with goat’s milk . These claims increased risky behaviour and exacerbated the crisis.  Now, we are seeing a fresh inundation of fake news – this time around the coronavirus pandemic. From Facebook to WhatsApp, frequently shared misinformation include everything from what caused the outbreak to how you can prevent becoming ill . In past decades, dangerous lies spread about Aids which exacerbated the crisis (Credit: Getty Images) We’ve debunked several claims here on BBC Future, including misinformation around how sunshine , warm weather and drinking water can affect the coronavirus. The BBC’s Reality Check team is also checking popular coronavirus claims , and the World Health Organization is keeping a myth-busting page regularly updated too.  You might also like:   What is Covid-19’s real death rate?  How fear of the coronavirus warps our minds  What Covid-19 means for the environment   At worst, the ideas themselves are harmful – a recent report from one province in Iran found that more people had died from drinking industrial-strength alcohol , based on a false claim that it could protect you from Covid-19, than from the virus itself. But even seemingly innocuous ideas could lure you and others into a false sense of security, discouraging you from adhering to government guidelines, and eroding trust in health officials and organisations.  There’s evidence these ideas are sticking. One poll by YouGov and the Economist in March 2020 found 13% of Americans believed the Covid-19 crisis was a hoax, for example, while a whopping 49% believed the epidemic might be man-made. And while you might hope that greater brainpower or education would help us to tell fact from fiction, it is easy to find examples of many educated people falling for this false information.  Just consider the writer Kelly Brogan, a prominent Covid-19 conspiracy theorist ; she has a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studied psychiatry at Cornell University. Yet she has shunned clear evidence of the virus’s danger in countries like China and Italy. She even went as far as to question the basic tenets of germ theory itself while endorsing pseudoscientific ideas. Kelly Brogan received a medical degree from Cornell University, yet has questioned germ theory and the existence of Covid-19 (Credit: Getty Images) Even some world leaders – who you would hope to have greater discernment when it comes to unfounded rumours – have been guilty of spreading inaccurate information about the risk of the outbreak and promoting unproven remedies that may do more harm than good , leading Twitter and Facebook to take the unprecedented step of removing their posts.  Fortunately, psychologists are already studying this phenomenon. And what they find might suggest new ways to protect ourselves from lies and help stem the spread of this misinformation and foolish behaviour.  Information overload  Part of the problem arises from the nature of the messages themselves.  We are bombarded with information all day, every day, and we therefore often rely on our intuition to decide whether something is accurate. As BBC Future has described in the past, purveyors of fake news can make their message feel “truthy” through a few simple tricks, which discourages us from applying our critical thinking skills – such as checking the veracity of its source. As the authors of one paper put it: “ When thoughts flow smoothly, people nod along .”  Eryn Newman at Australian National University, for instance, has shown that the simple presence of an image alongside a statement increases our trust in its accuracy – even if it is only tangentially related to the claim. A generic image of a virus accompanying some claim about a new treatment, say, may offer no proof of the statement itself, but it helps us visualise the general scenario. We take that “processing fluency” as a sign that the claim is true. The mere presence of an image alongside a statement increases our trust in its accuracy (Credit: Getty Images) For similar reasons, misinformation will include descriptive language or vivid personal stories. It will also feature just enough familiar facts or figures – such as mentioning the name of a recognised medical body – to make the lie within feel convincing, allowing it to tether itself to our previous knowledge.  The more often we see something in our news feed, the more likely we are to think that it’s true – even if we were originally sceptical Even the simple repetition of a statement – whether the same text, or over multiple messages – can increase the “truthiness” by increasing feelings of familiarity, which we mistake for factual accuracy. So, the more often we see something in our news feed, the more likely we are to think that it’s true – even if we were originally sceptical.  Sharing before thinking  These tricks have long been known by propagandists and peddlers of misinformation , but today’s social media may exaggerate our gullible tendencies. Recent evidence shows that many people reflexively share content without even thinking about its accuracy. In one study, only about 25% of participants said the fake news was true– but 35% said they would share the headline Gordon Pennycook, a leading researcher into the psychology of misinformation at the University of Regina, Canada, asked participants to consider a mixture of true and false headlines about the coronavirus outbreak. When they were specifically asked to judge the accuracy of the statements, the participants said the fake news was true about 25% of time. When they were simply asked whether they would share the headline, however, around 35% said they would pass on the fake news – 10% more.  “It suggests people were sharing material that they could have known was false, if they had thought about it more directly,” Pennycook says. (Like much of the cutting-edge research on Covid-19, this research has not yet been peer-reviewed, but a pre-print has been uploaded to the Psyarxiv website .)  Perhaps their brains were engaged in wondering whether a statement would get likes and retweets rather than considering its accuracy. “Social media doesn’t incentivise truth,” Pennycook says. “What it incentivises is engagement.” Research suggests that some people share material they would know was false if they thought about it more directly (Credit: Getty Images) Or perhaps they thought they could shift responsibility on to others to judge: many people have been sharing false information with a sort of disclaimer at the top, saying something like “I don’t know if this is true, but…”. They may think that if there’s any truth to the information, it could be helpful to friends and followers, and if it isn’t true, it’s harmless – so the impetus is to share it, not realising that sharing causes harm too.

Cognitive miserliness renders us susceptible to many cognitive biases , and it also seems to change the way we consume information (and misinformation).  We consume headlines and posts differently depending on our amount of ‘cognitive miserliness’ (Credit: Getty Images) When it came to the coronavirus statements, for instance, Pennycook found that people who scored badly on the CRT were less discerning in the statements that they believed and were willing to share.  Matthew Stanley, at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, has reported a similar pattern in people’s susceptibility to the coronavirus hoax theories . Remember that around 13% of US citizens believed this theory, which could potentially discourage hygiene and social distancing . “Thirteen percent seems like plenty to make this [virus] go around very quickly,” Stanley says.  Testing participants soon after the original YouGov/Economist poll was conducted, he found that people who scored worse on the CRT were significantly more susceptible to these flawed arguments.  These cognitive misers were also less likely to report having changed their behaviour to stop the disease from spreading – such as handwashing and social distancing.  Stop the spread  Knowing that many people – even the intelligent and educated – have these “miserly” tendencies to accept misinformation at face value might help us to stop the spread of misinformation.  Given the work on truthiness – the idea that we “nod along when thoughts flow smoothly” – organisations attempting to debunk a myth should avoid being overly complex.  To fight misinformation, it’s important to present the facts as simply as possible (Credit: Getty Images) Instead, they should present the facts as simply as possible – preferably with aids like images and graphs that make the ideas easier to visualise. As Stanley puts it: “We need more communications and strategy work to target those folks who are not as willing to be reflective and deliberative.” It’s simply not good enough to present a sound argument and hope that it sticks.  If they can, these campaigns should avoid repeating the myths themselves. The repetition makes the idea feel more familiar, which could increase perceptions of truthiness. That’s not always possible, of course. But campaigns can at least try to make the true facts more prominent and more memorable than the myths, so they are more likely to stick in people’s minds. (It is for this reason that I’ve given as little information as possible about the hoax theories in this article.)  When it comes to our own online behaviour, we might try to disengage from the emotion of the content and think a bit more about its factual basis before passing it on. Is it based on hearsay or hard scientific evidence? Can you trace it back to the original source? How does it compare to the existing data? And is the author relying on the common logical fallacies to make their case? One thing we can do is simply think about a post’s factual basis before we pass it on (Credit: Getty Images)  These are the questions that we should be asking – rather than whether or not the post is going to start amassing likes, or whether it “could” be helpful to others. And there is some evidence that we can all get better at this kind of thinking with practice .  Pennycook suggests that social media networks could nudge their users to be more discerning with relatively straightforward interventions. In his experiments, he found that asking participants to rate the factual accuracy of a single claim primed participants to start thinking more critically about other statements, so that they were more than twice as discerning about the information they shared.  In practice, it might be as simple as a social media platform providing the occasional automated reminder to think twice before sharing, though careful testing could help the companies to find the most reliable strategy, he says.  There is no panacea. Like our attempts to contain the virus itself, we are going to need a multi-pronged approach to fight the dissemination of dangerous and potentially life-threatening misinformation.  And as the crisis deepens, it will be everyone’s responsibility to stem that spread.  --  David Robson is the author of The Intelligence Trap , which examines why smart people act foolishly and the ways we can all make wiser decisions.

It's called ‘microaggression’  Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Linkedin Bookmark this article By Tom Stafford  10th June 2016   Many people don't even realise that they are discriminating based on race or gender. And they won't believe that their unconscious actions have consequences until they see scientific evidence. Here it is.  T The country in which I live has laws forbidding discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, religion, sexuality or sex. We've come a long way since the days when the reverse was true – when homosexuality was illegal, for instance, or when women were barred from voting. But this doesn't mean that prejudice is over, of course. Nowadays we need to be as concerned about subtler strains of prejudice as the kind of loud-mouthed racism and sexism that makes us ashamed of the past. Subtle prejudice is the domain of unjustified assumptions, dog-whistles , and plain failure to make the effort to include people who are different from ourselves, or who don't fit our expectations. One word for the expressions of subtle prejudice is ‘microaggressions’. These are things such as repeating a thoughtless stereotype, or too readily dismissing someone’s viewpoint – actions that may seem unworthy of comment, but can nevertheless marginalise an individual. If you interrupt women more than men in meetings, you are displaying a sexist implicit attitude The people perpetrating these microaggressions may be completely unaware that they hold a prejudiced view. Psychologists distinguish between our explicit attitudes – which are the beliefs and feelings we'll admit to – and our implicit attitudes – which are our beliefs and feelings which are revealed by our actions. So, for example, you might say that you are not a sexist, you might even say that you are anti-sexist, but if you interrupt women more than men in meetings you would be displaying a sexist implicit attitude – one which is very different from that non-sexist explicit attitude you profess. ‘Culture of victimhood’ The thing about subtle prejudice is that it is by definition subtle – lots of small differences in how people are treated, small asides, little jibes, ambiguous differences in how we treat one person compared to another. This makes it hard to measure, and hard to address, and – for some people – hard to take seriously. This is the skeptical line of thought: when people complain about being treated differently in small ways they are being overly sensitive, trying to lay claim to a culture of victimhood . Small differences are just that – small. They don't have large influences on life outcomes and aren't where we should focus our attention. Now you will have your own intuitions about that view, but my interest is in how you could test the idea that a thousand small cuts do add up. A classic experiment on the way race affects our interactions shows not only the myriad ways in which race can affect how we treat people, but shows in a clever way that even the most privileged of us would suffer if we were all subjected to subtle discrimination. Even the politest interviewer may be acting with subtle prejudice that influences a candidate's performance (Credit: Getty Images) In the early 1970s, a team led by Carl Word at Princeton University recruited white students for an experiment they were told was about assessing the quality of job candidates. Unbeknown to them, the experiment was really about how they treated the supposed job candidates, and whether this was different based on whether they were white or black.

Next, the researchers recruited more white Princeton undergraduates to play the role of job candidates, and they were randomly assigned to be nonverbally treated like the white candidates in the first experiment, or like the black candidates. One classic study attempted to subject white participants to the same racist microaggressions suffered by black interviewees (Credit: Getty Images) The results allow us to see the self-fulfilling prophesy of discrimination. The candidates who received the ""black"" nonverbal signals delivered a worse interview performance, as rated by independent judges. They made far more speech errors, in the form of hesitations, stutters, mistakes and incomplete sentences, and they chose to sit further away from the interviewer following a mid-interview interruption which caused them to retake their chairs. If even a privileged elite suffer under this treatment, we might expect even larger effects for people without those advantages It isn't hard to see that in a winner-takes-all situation like a job interview, such differences could be enough to lose you a job opportunity. What's remarkable is that the participants’ performance had been harmed by nonverbal differences of the kind that many of us might produce without intending or realising. Furthermore, the effect was seen in students from Princeton University, one of the world's elite universities. If even a white, privileged elite suffer under this treatment we might expect even larger effects for people who don't walk into high-pressure situations with those advantages. Experiments like these don't offer the whole truth about discrimination. Problems like racism are patterned by so much more than individual attitudes, and often supported by explicit prejudice as well as subtle prejudice. Racism will affect candidates before, during and after job interviews in many more ways than I’ve described. What this work does show is one way in which, even with good intentions, people's reactions to minority groups can have powerful effects.

Many of the models being used to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic give poor predictions of both the epidemic's peak and its duration—according to an academic at the University of East Anglia (UEA).

Comparison of a new approach with a published model of COVID-19 in Wuhan before isolation and social distancing measures were imposed shows that the standard model underestimates the peak infection rate by a factor of three—meaning it could be three times higher—and substantially overestimates how long the epidemic will continue after the peak.

Mathematical models are widely used to understand and predict the dynamics of epidemics, and to assess the likely effectiveness of different disease management measures such as quarantining of infected individuals.

Some track the progress of the disease through individuals, but most publications that model the COVID-19 epidemic use what is known as a 'compartment' or ""SEIR' model. This tracks numbers of individuals that are Susceptible to the disease, have been Exposed but not yet showing symptoms (sometimes called the incubation period), are Infected (showing symptoms) or Recovering.

However, these models group all individuals in a compartment together, ignoring the actual time since they were infected. They then predict the future course of the epidemic from information on rates of transmission and the average time that an individual takes before they show symptoms and then to recover.

In his paper Prof Alastair Grant, of UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, argues that while SEIR and other compartment models can predict how far the disease transmission rate needs to be reduced to stop an epidemic growing, they do a poor job of predicting the path of an epidemic that is growing. He says this problem was identified in the research literature at least 15 years ago, but the available solutions to it are far more difficult to use than the SEIR model.

Attempting to address this Prof Grant, who has previously introduced key methodological tools into matrix population modelling, presents a new approach that tracks the time since individuals were infected, while retaining the simplicity of a model that can be described in a few lines of code.

Due to the rapid-response nature of this research, it has not yet been peer-reviewed.

""Standard compartment models of disease, such as SEIR, are being widely used to model the dynamics of the COVID‐19 epidemic,"" said Prof Grant. ""However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics.

""This paper shows how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and therefore correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. Our explicit time model shows that the peak of infection may be either earlier or later than the peak in the simple SEIR model.

""I believe that the approach outlined here provides a valuable solution to the problem of incorporating a time dimension within each compartment. This model could readily be adapted and we hope that it will be of some use to the COVID‐19 modelling community.""

Prof Grant cautions that the implications of these findings for state policies to manage of COVID‐19 epidemics are not clear.

""If SEIR models use parameter values estimated independently from data they will underestimate the proportion of the population which will be infected at the epidemic's peak,"" said Prof Grant. ""But, if inverse modelling uses SEIR models to estimate parameters from disease time series, they may give estimates that are too pessimistic.

""National policies are guided by a range of disease models, including ones which deal more effectively with the known time course of infection within individuals, but details of this modelling work are not always made public.

""However, the domination of the published scientific literature by compartment models may be in danger of creating a discontinuity between the views held in the research community and the modelling that is informing national decision making about the management of COVID‐19.""

""Governments must make available details of the models that provide the basis for policy decisions, so that the scientific community can critically assess these and help to improve the quality of predictions being made.

7,(underestimate|overestimate) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/we-could-be-vastly-overestimating-the-death-rate-for-covid-19-heres-why,"Public health epidemiology is the science of counting to prevent disease and promote health. We count the number of new cases of a particular disease; this is the incidence. Then we count how much a disease has spread in a population; this is the prevalence.

When it comes to COVID-19, counting is a challenge. Despite all the news articles and reports, we know very little about the incidence or prevalence of this new disease. And as is always the case, ignorance breeds fear. In my hometown of New York City and elsewhere, one fear is on just about everyone’s mind: death rates here appear to be considerably higher than rates reported elsewhere.

Or are they? Using patient data from China, public health officials initially estimated that 80% of COVID-19 cases are either asymptomatic or have mild disease. Given that hospital beds, health workers, and test kits are in short supply, only highly symptomatic people are advised to go to the hospital. Because of a lack of adequate testing⁠ — including in the United States ⁠— in many places only hospital patients are now counted as cases. The people who do not feel seriously ill stay home, recover quietly, and are never counted. This matters because they do not appear in any of the official statistics.

Take for example an elderly New Yorker who is mildly sick. She calls her family doctor who makes a clinical diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 based on her symptoms, not a test. Because she is not very sick, she is advised to stay home. There is no mechanism for her doctor to report her diagnosis to the health authorities, so if she gets better, she is never counted. Only if she becomes ill enough to be admitted to the hospital, is she counted as a COVID-19 case. If she dies she will be counted as a COVID-19 death.

Since many of us are experiencing homeschooling these days, it seems a good time for a math refresher. Once the number of infections is determined, this becomes the denominator in our public health calculation. The number of deaths is our numerator.

Numerator (number of deaths)/denominator (number of people infected) x 100 = infection fatality rate

We know the virus spreads very fast once it is introduced to a population. That means many of us in the general population are or were already infected with the virus — whether or not we have symptoms.","     日本語              SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT & SOCIETY PEACE & SECURITY HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS HUMAN RIGHTS ABOUT     SECTIONS    SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT & SOCIETY PEACE & SECURITY HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS HUMAN RIGHTS ABOUT              We Could Be Vastly Overestimating the Death Rate for COVID-19 — Here’s Why   DEVELOPMENT & SOCIETY : Health , Social Development , Statistics     2020•04•15  Nina Schwalbe  United Nations University     Email  Tweet  Share     Photo: UN Women , Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 2.0    Public health epidemiology is the science of counting to prevent disease and promote health.

That means many of us in the general population are or were already infected with the virus — whether or not we have symptoms.  COVID-19 testing rates and counting methods vary widely from country to country. Graphic: ourworldindata.org , Creative Commons BY 4.0   However, instead of counting us all in the denominator — in many countries including the US — only people sick enough to go to the hospital are counted. People sick enough to go to the hospital are more likely to need critical care, and patients in critical condition are more likely to die than patients with mild symptoms. This means the fatality rate looks higher than it really is.  Further, even when we are testing — depending on the type of test used — we may only be counting people who are actively infected, not those who had it and are thus currently immune. This again will lead to an underestimate of the denominator.  What does it mean? It means that the denominator (number of infections) is smaller than it should be, so the numerator (number of deaths) has a lot of power. In this case, the result is that the death rate (numerator divided by denominator) reported is higher than it should be. In other words, by not counting the people who don’t need hospital care, we are massively over-projecting the percent of infected people who die of COVID-19. It’s a dangerous message that is causing fear all driven by a false denominator.  In the coming days, the death rate is going to look worse, especially as hospitals get more and more crowded and we ration care. It will seem as if a higher percentage of COVID-infected people are dying than is actually the case. Unlike other diseases, there is neither enough nor appropriate testing, making it impossible to assess how many of us were already infected and thus are no longer at risk of infection. The vast majority of us will be infected, survive, and remain unaware if we carried the virus or were contagious, so we will unwittingly infect our friends and family members.  Data from across the US and from other countries about deaths by age, underlying medical conditions, medications being taken at time of death, and other factors could eventually help us understand how COVID-19 behaves at both a population and individual level. In the meantime, we need to adjust official population-level estimates of case numbers, or at the very least, build better systems for sharing data and reporting.  And at some point, we will return to and rebuild our daily routines, with the new addition of attending to the mental health crisis caused by weeks of fear, isolation, and anxiety — much of which could have been avoided by an accurate and clear definition of the denominator.  •••  The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations University.

7,(underestimate|overestimate) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),5,https://atalayar.com/en/content/subestim%C3%B3-boris-johnson-la-pandemia,"“The UK lost five crucial weeks” and underestimated the consequences that the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the health of the British people. This is one of the phrases with which the British newspaper The Sunday Times has described, in an investigation, how the British Executive dealt with the pandemic. And in an unusual move, the Downing Street Health Department selected the newspaper's allegations to refute them and described the elements of its investigation as “clearly false” and “ridiculous”.

In parts, the article criticized the lack of coordination and decision-making by the Johnson Administration. According to the text, the British 'premier' didn't attend five emergency meetings of Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA). These meetings, which are usually chaired by the prime minister and a high-level staff such as the heads of intelligence and generals, were convened to share and discuss the information held by the British authorities in mid-February and thus prepare the National Health Service (NHS). But Johnson, who is now successfully recovering from the virus after several days in intensive care, didn't attend any of the meetings.

Immunity for everyone

At first, the British government opted for the theory of 'collective immunity', a strategy defended by the Johnson Administration's scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, who argued that 60% of the British population should be infected in order to achieve immunity and control the virus in the long term.

The steps taken by Johnson held on to this risky theory. On February 28, when the first death of a British citizen with a coronavirus was confirmed, the British chief executive said that slowing down coronavirus infections was his government's number one priority, one month after the first case was confirmed in the islands.

Faced with the drastic decisions taken by the countries in Europe most affected by the COVID-19, such as Spain and Italy, to suspend all events and limit the movement of their citizens, even to go to work, Johnson opted for much less aggressive measures, suggesting maintaining hygiene and thus avoiding a halt in the British economy.

Johnson's roadmap was based on the theory that, if the peak of the pandemic could be delayed, the NHS would cope more effectively with the disease when the climate improved, as more beds would be available in the summer as the number of people with common respiratory diseases decreased. But by March 12, the numbers of infections and deaths had risen significantly. That's when the prime minister admitted that “many families are going to lose loved ones before time”.

These statements spread a certain panic among the British public, even more so when a study from Imperial College in London was made public, in which, based on a mathematical model, it warned that more than 250,000 people could die from the coronavirus if the government didn't change its strategy.

From ‘Vote to Leave’ to ‘Let them die’

The decision to go ahead with collective immunity, according to the British media, came from Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings, who is seen as the hand that pulls the strings in British politics and the great strategist behind the campaign to leave the European Union.

The Sunday Times article quoted him on March 12 as saying that collective immunity “will protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners will die, too bad”. Days later, like his boss, Cummings reported that he had symptoms of COVID-19 and decided to isolate himself. Later, the British news agency PA said that Cummings and Johnson were in contact via video conference. At the last one, the consultant changed his speech: “Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save lives”.

New strategy, but too late

The upsurge in cases and the evolution of the disease in Europe led Johnson to start talking about “suppression” rather than mitigation of the virus. And on March 2, the president finally attended a COBRA meeting. However, it was not until the 20th of that month that the British Prime Minister ordered a quarantine, closing down bars, restaurants, cinemas, gyms. Three days later, on the 23rd, the Tory Government ordered the closure of all non-essential shops, teleworking where possible and limiting movement.

According to the BBC, The Sunday Times journalist Jonathan Leake, one of the authors of the controversial article, pointed out the Brexit process as one of the mistakes - or “distractions” - that the government made, by not listening to the scientific community because it was more aware of the European Union's exit negotiations. “January 26 and 27 was a time when the government was incredibly distracted by the EU's exit [...] the government should have paid more attention to what was coming up,” the British network reports.

“Boris Johnson skipped five Cobra meetings about the virus, ignored calls for protective equipment and ignored scientists' warnings. The failures that occurred in February may have cost thousands of lives,” reads the Sunday Times article.

For its part, The Mirror, a popular tabloid in England, claimed that Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, spent nearly two weeks in a country mansion while the government cabinet held emergency meetings on COVID-19.

Downing Street Response

All these statements in the conservative newspaper have been rejected by the British government, insisting that the UK “has been taking steps and working to improve its preparation since the beginning of January”.

In a statement on the British Government's website, the Department of Health and Social Care Media Centre said that “this is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right measures at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice”.

In an unprecedented response, the Executive's text takes up point by point what they see as “misrepresentations” and shows their version of events. According to the British authorities, the usual thing is that the Prime Minister doesn't attend COBRA meetings and instead the Secretary of Health chairs them.

In addition, the Sunday Times article reports that the government sent 279,000 items from its health arsenal in response to China's request to combat the virus. However, the Executive replied that the equipment given to Beijing was not from the stockpile and that “we provided this equipment to China to meet its needs and China has since reciprocated our donation. Between 2 and 15 April, we received over 12 million pieces of personal protection equipment in the UK from China”.

Faced with the British newspaper's criticism of Downing Street's attitude of “trying to minimize the threat with an almost indifferent attitude,” the Health Department defends itself and suggests that, at that time, in February, “extensive and detailed work was being carried out”.

For the moment, the United Kingdom has counted more than 130,000 infected people and nearly 19,000 deaths, although, according to an investigation by the Financial Times, not all deaths from coronaviruses are being counted, so the true number of deaths would be close to 40,000, according to data from the National Statistics Office. According to the economic newspaper, the British government only takes into account those deaths that had been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19 in hospitals, without taking into account those who died in nursing homes or those who had not yet been diagnosed by the tests.","                     It&apos;s news    Greece strengthens its alliance with the Libyan House of Representatives through the opening of a consulate in Benghazi  Movistar Inter leaves the LNFS  Venezuela and the state repression in times of pandemic  Iraq suspends oil shipment to Jordan due to falling barrel prices  WOOE Conference: Olive oil under examination by the most renowned experts in the sector                Friday, July  3 , 2020                       The keys of the world in your hands          Select your language  es fr en                          Main navigation      Cover page    Present     Economy and business    Politics    Society    Culture    New technologies-innovation    Sports      Opinion    Magazine    Multimedia     Atalayar on images    Atalayar TV    Atalayar Radio                         Menu second      About    Gallery    Services    404 Page                    Search                                                  Breadcrumb    Home  /    Política  /     Did Boris Johnson underestimate the pandemic?                       Politics   April 27   2020    Did Boris Johnson underestimate the pandemic?    An article in The Sunday Times criticises Downing Street's handling of the crisis. For its part, the British government has called this information “ridiculous”    Carlota Pérez          AFP/ DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS -  
														British Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at Downing Street in central London on April 27, 2020, after being hospitalized with COVID-19      “The UK lost five crucial weeks” and underestimated the consequences that the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the health of the British people. This is one of the phrases with which the British newspaper The Sunday Times has described, in an investigation, how the British Executive dealt with the pandemic. And in an unusual move, the Downing Street Health Department selected the newspaper's allegations to refute them and described the elements of its investigation as “clearly false” and “ridiculous”.  In parts, the article criticized the lack of coordination and decision-making by the Johnson Administration. According to the text, the British 'premier' didn't attend five emergency meetings of Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA). These meetings, which are usually chaired by the prime minister and a high-level staff such as the heads of intelligence and generals, were convened to share and discuss the information held by the British authorities in mid-February and thus prepare the National Health Service (NHS). But Johnson, who is now successfully recovering from the virus after several days in intensive care, didn't attend any of the meetings.  AFP/ JUSTIN TALLIS - A police officer (C) tells members of the public that they are not allowed to sit and enjoy the sun on the grass, but are allowed to walk for exercise, in London Fields Park in East London Immunity for everyone  At first, the British government opted for the theory of 'collective immunity', a strategy defended by the Johnson Administration's scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, who argued that 60% of the British population should be infected in order to achieve immunity and control the virus in the long term.  The steps taken by Johnson held on to this risky theory. On February 28, when the first death of a British citizen with a coronavirus was confirmed, the British chief executive said that slowing down coronavirus infections was his government's number one priority, one month after the first case was confirmed in the islands.  Faced with the drastic decisions taken by the countries in Europe most affected by the COVID-19, such as Spain and Italy, to suspend all events and limit the movement of their citizens, even to go to work, Johnson opted for much less aggressive measures, suggesting maintaining hygiene and thus avoiding a halt in the British economy.  PHOTO/Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/Handout via REUTERS - UK Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance speaks at the daily coronavirus press conference at 10 Downing Street in London on 17 April 2020 Johnson's roadmap was based on the theory that, if the peak of the pandemic could be delayed, the NHS would cope more effectively with the disease when the climate improved, as more beds would be available in the summer as the number of people with common respiratory diseases decreased. But by March 12, the numbers of infections and deaths had risen significantly. That's when the prime minister admitted that “many families are going to lose loved ones before time”.  These statements spread a certain panic among the British public, even more so when a study from Imperial College in London was made public, in which, based on a mathematical model, it warned that more than 250,000 people could die from the coronavirus if the government didn't change its strategy.  From ‘Vote to Leave’ to ‘Let them die’  The decision to go ahead with collective immunity, according to the British media, came from Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings , who is seen as the hand that pulls the strings in British politics and the great strategist behind the campaign to leave the European Union.  The Sunday Times article quoted him on March 12 as saying that collective immunity “will protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners will die, too bad”. Days later, like his boss, Cummings reported that he had symptoms of COVID-19 and decided to isolate himself. Later, the British news agency PA said that Cummings and Johnson were in contact via video conference. At the last one, the consultant changed his speech: “Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save lives”.  AFP/ JUSTIN TALLIS - Dominic Cummings arrives at 10 Downing Street in central London to attend the Government's daily briefing about COVID-19 New strategy, but too late  The upsurge in cases and the evolution of the disease in Europe led Johnson to start talking about “suppression” rather than mitigation of the virus. And on March 2, the president finally attended a COBRA meeting. However, it was not until the 20th of that month that the British Prime Minister ordered a quarantine, closing down bars, restaurants, cinemas, gyms. Three days later, on the 23rd, the Tory Government ordered the closure of all non-essential shops, teleworking where possible and limiting movement.  According to the BBC, The Sunday Times journalist Jonathan Leake, one of the authors of the controversial article, pointed out the Brexit process as one of the mistakes - or “distractions” - that the government made, by not listening to the scientific community because it was more aware of the European Union's exit negotiations. “January 26 and 27 was a time when the government was incredibly distracted by the EU's exit [...] the government should have paid more attention to what was coming up,” the British network reports.  AFP/TOLGA AKMEN - People buy drinks at a store in East London's Broadway market on April 24, 2020, during the national shutdown due to the new COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic “Boris Johnson skipped five Cobra meetings about the virus, ignored calls for protective equipment and ignored scientists' warnings. The failures that occurred in February may have cost thousands of lives,” reads the Sunday Times article.  For its part, The Mirror, a popular tabloid in England, claimed that Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, spent nearly two weeks in a country mansion while the government cabinet held emergency meetings on COVID-19.

In a statement on the British Government's website, the Department of Health and Social Care Media Centre said that “this is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right measures at the right time to combat it , guided at all times by the best scientific advice”.  PHOTO/AFP - A man wearing a surgical mask walks past the market stalls on Electric Avenue in Brixton, South London, on 23 April 2020 In an unprecedented response, the Executive's text takes up point by point what they see as “misrepresentations” and shows their version of events. According to the British authorities, the usual thing is that the Prime Minister doesn't attend COBRA meetings and instead the Secretary of Health chairs them.  In addition, the Sunday Times article reports that the government sent 279,000 items from its health arsenal in response to China's request to combat the virus. However, the Executive replied that the equipment given to Beijing was not from the stockpile and that “we provided this equipment to China to meet its needs and China has since reciprocated our donation. Between 2 and 15 April, we received over 12 million pieces of personal protection equipment in the UK from China”.

8,chance of (catching|infect|transmission|get a) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/well/live/whats-the-risk-of-catching-coronavirus-from-a-surface.html,"“There’s a long chain of events that would need to happen for someone to become infected through contact with groceries, mail, takeout containers or other surfaces,” said Julia Marcus, an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor in the department of population medicine at Harvard Medical School. “The last step in that causal chain is touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hand, so the best way to make sure the chain is broken is washing your hands.”

An outbreak associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China, may have been fueled by fomite transmission. In January, seven workers who shared an office in a shopping mall became ill when one of their co-workers returned from Wuhan. The mall was closed, and public health officials tracked two dozen more sick people, including several women who had shopped at the mall, as well as their friends. None of them had come into contact with the original sick office workers. The researchers speculated that a women’s restroom or the mall elevators had been the source of transmission.

Other studies have used invisible fluorescent tracers — fake germs that glow under black light — to track how germs are spread from surfaces. The findings are unnerving. In one series of experiments, 86 percent of workers were contaminated when spray or powder tracers were put on commonly touched objects in an office. When tracer powder was put on a bathroom faucet and exit doorknob, the glowing residue was found on employees’ hands, faces, phones and hair. From a shared phone, the tracer spread to desktop surfaces, drinking cups, keyboards, pens and doorknobs. A contaminated copy machine button added a trail of fluorescent finger prints transferred to documents and computer equipment. And just 20 minutes after arriving home from the office, the fake germs were found on backpacks, keys and purses, and on home doorknobs, light switches, countertops and kitchen appliances.

A video making rounds on the internet shows how the black light experiment works. The glow germs are put on the hands of just one diner at a buffet, but by the end of the meal, everyone at the table has come into contact with the glowing germs. The video explains why scientists discourage the sharing of food during a viral outbreak.

But while those experiments show how germs can spread on surfaces, the microbe still has to survive long enough and in a large enough dose to make you sick. Eugene M. Chudnovsky, a professor at the City University of New York, notes that surfaces are not a particularly effective means of viral transmission. With the flu, for instance, it takes millions of copies of the influenza virus to infect a person through surface-to-hand-to-nose contact, but it may take only a few thousand copies to infect a person when the flu virus goes from the air directly into the lungs.

Dr. Chudnovsky, a theoretical physicist whose research has focused on the spread of the airborne infection, said a similar pattern is likely to be true for the new coronavirus, but the exact numbers are not known.

“I believe the C.D.C. is right when it says that surface transmission is not a dominant one,” said Dr. Chudnovsky. “Surfaces frequently touched by a large number of people, like door handles, elevator buttons, etc., may play a more significant role in spreading the infection than objects touched incidentally, like food packages delivered to homes.”","   Sections SEARCH Skip to content Skip to site index Live Today’s Paper Live | What’s the Risk of Catching Coronavirus From a Surface? https://nyti.ms/2ZIMdUZ       At Home     Swim: With Sea Lions    Make: Trash Cocktails    Watch: ‘Unsolved Mysteries’    Dig In: On Reporters’ Obsessions        Advertisement Continue reading the main story Supported by Continue reading the main story Ask Well What’s the Risk of Catching Coronavirus From a Surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. Credit... Getty Images By  Tara Parker-Pope Published May 28, 2020 Updated June 3, 2020 Fears about catching the coronavirus from contaminated surfaces have prompted many of us to spend the past few months wiping down groceries, leaving packages unopened and stressing about touching elevator buttons. But what’s the real risk of catching Covid-19 from a germy surface or object? The question has been on people’s minds lately, and there was some confusion after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made some edits to its website last week. Social media sites and some news outlets suggested the agency had downgraded its warnings and that surface transmission was no longer a worry. The C.D.C. subsequently issued a news release to clarify that indirect contact from a contaminated surface — what scientists call fomite transmission — remains a potential risk for catching Covid-19. “Based on data from lab studies on Covid-19 and what we know about similar respiratory diseases, it may be possible that a person can get Covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes,” the agency wrote. “But this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” So does this mean we can catch coronavirus from touching a doorknob? Catching a Frisbee? Sharing a casserole dish? The answer, in theory, is yes, which is why you need to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face . A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals . “What they’re saying is that high touch surfaces like railings and doorknobs, elevator buttons are not the primary driver of the infection in the United States,” said Erin Bromage , a comparative immunologist and biology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. “But it’s still a bad idea to touch your face. If someone who is infectious coughs on their hand and shakes your hand and you rub your eyes — yes, you’re infected. Someone’s drinking from a glass, and you pick it up near the rim and later rub your eyes or mouth, you’re infected.” Here’s how fomite transmission works. An infected person coughs or sneezes on their hands. Some of the droplets may splash onto a nearby surface, or the person spreads the germs by touching a faucet or countertop before washing his hands. Studies show that coronavirus can last up to three days on plastic and steel, but once it lands on a surface, the amount of viable virus begins to disintegrate in a matter of hours. That means a droplet on a surface is far more infectious right after the sneeze — not so much a few days later. Next, you have to come along and touch the contaminated surface, pick up enough viable virus on your hands, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. If all goes well for the virus, you will get sick. “There’s a long chain of events that would need to happen for someone to become infected through contact with groceries, mail, takeout containers or other surfaces,” said Julia Marcus , an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor in the department of population medicine at Harvard Medical School. “The last step in that causal chain is touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hand, so the best way to make sure the chain is broken is washing your hands.” An outbreak associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China, may have been fueled by fomite transmission .

According to infectious-disease experts, there are several ways to determine how risky an activity or place is. Coronavirus transmission risk is somewhat lower outside than indoors, for example, though the most important factors to consider are how close you'll get to other people and for how long.

A man wearing a mask runs in front of the Bay Bridge along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in April.  Jeff Chiu / AP    The coronavirus typically spreads via droplets when people are close to someone sick for a while. Those types of prolonged interactions can happen anywhere, but experts have suggested that the risk of infection is lower outside. A preliminary report from scientists in Japan (which has not been peer-reviewed) suggested that the odds that an infected person ""transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment."" Another preprint of a study examined 318 outbreaks in China that involved three or more cases and found that all but one involved the virus jumping between people indoors. The case clusters studied, however, occurred while many people were under mandatory lockdowns, which might have skewed the results.           The reasons your chance of infection might be lower outside, Schaffner said, are that it's easier to maintain social distance outdoors and that the virus has to navigate wind, heat, and humidity to jump between people.

""What you do becomes the single most important thing — less so the environment,"" Schaffner said.           2. How well you can practice social distancing when doing an activity or visiting a certain place?           Kids swimming at a public pool.  REUTERS/Lucas Jackson    Schaffner said the most important assessment he makes when deciding whether to enter a coffee shop, for example, is how well he can maintain his distance from other customers. ""I&apos;m most concerned about how far apart I am from my fellow patrons,"" he said, adding, ""It continues to be prudent to keep as distant from people as possible, no matter where you are.""           3. If the place you're visiting is indoors (like a restaurant or coffee shop), to what extent are patrons and staff members wearing masks?           Servers at The Original Ninfa's in Houston, Texas, wear gloves and masks while fulfilling takeout orders on May 1.  MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images    Schaffner suggested being very careful in or near gatherings of any size — and ""when in doubt,"" he said, ""don&apos;t be stubborn, and wear a mask."" Masks help protect other people from germs the wearer might be carrying, so they are imperative in situations where it&apos;s difficult to maintain 6 feet of distance, he added. ""Make sure waitstaff are wearing gloves and masks,"" Schaffner said. ""If the waitstaff aren&apos;t wearing masks, I&apos;m getting my coffee across the street.""           4. Is the place you're visiting well ventilated?           A masked cashier rings up purchases behind a plexiglass shield at a grocery store in Queens, New York, on April 3.  Morse Collection/Gado/Getty Images    Scientists still aren&apos;t certain to what degree a cloud of tiny coronavirus particles — known as aerosols — can linger in the air and infect the next person who walks through the space. But research has suggested that more live viral particles are found in the air in enclosed rooms with little airflow. A study of two hospitals in Wuhan, China , found that the concentration of live coronavirus particles was highest in the air in nonventilated 9-square-foot toilet areas for patients, while the particles were less concentrated in the air in ventilated wards.           Some elevators, for example, could be transmission hot spots ""if they are crowded and people ride in them for a long time, like a minute or more several times a day,"" said Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech.           Taped-off areas marking the suggested distance between people in an elevator of an office building in Singapore.  Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images    Schaffner agreed . ""In such a tightly enclosed space without vigorous air movement for a short period of time, I&apos;m afraid you might be exposed,"" he said.           5. How long will you be visiting an indoor space?           People wearing face masks at a supermarket in Singapore on February 9.  Ore Huiying/Getty Images    The worst coronavirus clusters around the US have been tied to places that force people into close quarters for extended periods. The New York Times reported that all but one of the 12 hardest-hit US locations were prisons, jails, and meat-processing facilities. Nursing homes were also high on the list. ""The farther away you are and the shorter duration of contact between you and other people means you get less efficient virus transmission,"" Schaffner said.           Offices and restaurants can also be risky for that reason.           A Cracker Barrel restaurant in Georgia that reopened after stay-at-home orders lifted in May.  Courtesy of Cracker Barrel    In a letter recently published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, scientists described how nine people sitting more than 3 feet apart at a restaurant in China got the coronavirus in January. The virus likely spread because of the restaurant&apos;s air-conditioner , they said. Similarly, an outbreak at a call center in Seoul, South Korea , provided a case study of office transmission. Of the center&apos;s 811 employees, 97 got sick; all but three of the infected workers sat on the same floor, and 79 were in the same section.           6. Will you be able to avoid areas where people congregate for long periods?           People at California's Newport Beach on April 27.  Michael Heiman/Getty Images    People who play golf, go hiking, or visit the beach shouldn&apos;t linger in locker rooms, at trailheads, or in parking lots, Schaffner said. That&apos;s where people are more likely to stand around and have conversations without masks. He suggested that people visit the beach for exercise rather than for tanning and relaxation. ""If you let people on a beach to exercise, they&apos;ll stay apart,"" he said. ""If you let them bring beach umbrellas, they congregate and can&apos;t keep their distance.""           ""It's people coming together in groups that matters,"" Schaffner said.           Students at a graduation party at the University of Colorado Boulder on May 7.  MediaNews Group/Boulder Daily Camera via Getty Images    A recent study found that talking loudly could produce enough droplets to transmit the coronavirus and that those droplets could linger in the air for at least eight minutes. ""Any gathering, from the point of view of the virus, is ideal,"" Schaffner said. ""People get together, exchange stories, and, thank you very much, the virus is going to go from me to you.""           That's why fleeting encounters on a park trail are less risky.

Samuel Boivin/NurPhoto/Getty Images    ""I would not worry about walking by someone,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told Slate in late April . ""Even in a healthcare setting, contact is defined by being near someone for a certain amount of time. I would not worry about these fleeting encounters.""       ""The general principle should be: Outside is better than inside; open is better than closed; fewer is better than more people; and stay away from sick people,"" Dr. Erich Anderer, a neurosurgeon and founding member of the North Brooklyn Runners group, told Insider.

8,chance of (catching|infect|transmission|get a) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/current-risk-assessment-novel-coronavirus-situation,"What is the risk of COVID-19 to the general population as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

The risk of COVID 19 in the general population of the EU/EEA and the UK is currently assessed as:

Low in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing showing very low detection rates.

Moderate in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.

This assessment is based on the information below:

Decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed and sustained in almost all Member States, but several are still reporting ongoing community transmission:

As of 10 June, 29 EU/EEA countries and the UK had a decreasing 14-day incidence, while the 14-day incidence was at the highest level yet observed in two countries (Poland and Sweden).

Twenty-eight countries are reporting a current 14-day incidence below 20 cases per 100 000 population. In two countries (Portugal and the United Kingdom) the current 14-day incidence remains at a rate between 20 and 100 cases per 100 000 population. In one country (Sweden) the current 14-day incidence is above 100 cases per 100 000 population.

There remains uncertainty as to the extent of viral circulation as there is limited information available on the proportion of community transmission that occurs outside of known transmission chains and/or due to importation across countries.

The implementation of robust response measures in the EU was temporarily associated with an observed decrease in incidence. Although the composition and intensity of implementation varied, all EU/EEA countries and the UK introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (recommended or enforced – refer to Annex 4). While uncertainty remains about the extent to which the combination and intensity of these measures had an impact on transmission, such measures appear to have been associated, at least temporarily, with decreases in the number of newly reported cases.

In summary, the probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2 for the general population ranges from low (in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing, showing very low detection rates) to very high (in areas where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place and where community transmission is still high).

While the majority of cases of COVID-19 have a mild course of illness, the analysis of data from TESSy shows that the risk of hospitalisation increases rapidly with age, from as early as 30 years, and that the risk of death increases from the age of 50 years, although the majority of hospitalisations and deaths are among the oldest age groups. Older males are particularly affected, being more likely than females of the same age to be hospitalised, require ICU/respiratory support, or die. All-cause excess mortality from EuroMOMO, particularly at this time when competing drivers (influenza and high/low temperatures) are largely absent, shows considerable excess mortality in multiple countries, affecting both the 15−64 and 65+ years age groups in the pooled analysis. Once infected, no specific treatment for COVID-19 exists, however early supportive therapy may improve outcomes. There are ongoing trials that have demonstrated some evidence for limited reduction of symptom duration. There is evidence that since the start of the pandemic, case management, supportive treatment and care has improved.

Overall, the impact of COVID-19 is assessed as moderate for the general population.

What is the risk of COVID-19 to the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

The risk of COVID 19 to the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome is currently assessed as:

Moderate in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing showing very low detection rates.

Very high in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.

This assessment was based on the information below:

The probability of infection in the different areas has been assessed above and is the same for populations with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome: from low to very high.

Analysis of TESSy data shows that persons over 65 years of age and/or with underlying health conditions infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk of severe illness and death compared with younger individuals.

Long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which commonly house the elderly and the frail, have been heavily affected by COVID-19. The disease spreads rapidly on introduction, causing high morbidity in residents, commonly with a case fatality of over 25%. LTCFs were the focus of over half of the fatal COVID-19 cases in several EU/EEA countries and the UK. In summary, the impact of COVID-19 is assessed as very high in the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome.

What is the risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to levels that require stricter response measures, as a consequence of lifting/adjusting community level physical distancing measures?

The risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to a level that may require the re-introduction of stricter control measures is currently assessed as:

Moderate if measures are phased out gradually, when only sporadic or cluster transmission is reported, and when appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place.

High if measures are phased out when there is still ongoing community transmission, and no appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place.

This assessment was based on the information below:

The implementation of robust response measures in EU/EEA countries and the UK was temporarily associated with a decrease in incidence.

In the few weeks since the phase-out of some of the response measures, no rapid or major increase in incidence has been observed. Although the composition and intensity of implementation vary, all EU/EEA countries and the UK have introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission (recommended or enforced).

In addition to the implemented response measures, other factors may have contributed to the observed decrease in incidence including seasonality, self-awareness of the population in disease prevention and adherence to measures implemented by governments, a better application of infection prevention and control measures in the community and healthcare settings, and an increase in the offer of testing for exposed and/or symptomatic individuals.

The decrease in incidence at national level may hide a level of heterogeneity in disease incidence at subnational level.

While decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed, Member States are still reporting community transmission.

The information available from sero-epidemiological studies provides an indication that the population immunity is still low (<10%), therefore there is still a risk that susceptible individuals may become infected.

Even though no major increases in disease incidence have been observed in the weeks since the phase-out of non-pharmaceutical interventions began, an associated upsurge may still be anticipated. However, the reestablishment of transmission chains and larger clusters would take a few generations of infection.

The rate at which incidence of COVID-19 cases, and associated hospitalisations and deaths, could increase will depend on the effectiveness of the control measures that remain in place and on the extent to which people change their behaviour in comparison to the pre-COVID-19 era:

If people are more cautious, having learned about the risks of the disease or if they are instructed to change their behaviour (e.g. by wearing masks), the transmission rate would be lower than before measures were introduced.

However, the progressive lifting of the prohibition of mass gatherings may lead to some people meeting in larger numbers.

Furthermore, the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation or ICU care may be lower if older people and those who belong to risk groups restrict their contact rates to a greater extent than the general population following the phasing out of measures.

In summary, the probability of the risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to levels that require stricter response measures, as a consequence of lifting/adjusting community level physical distancing measures ranges from moderate (if measures are phased out gradually, when only sporadic or cluster transmission is reported, and when appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place) to very high (if measures are phased out when there is still ongoing community transmission, and no appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place).

An increase in COVID-19 incidence would be associated with increasing morbidity and mortality, with more severe morbidity and mortality likely if individuals at increased risk of severe outcome are not properly shielded. Such an increase, if not checked rapidly, may place healthcare systems under stress, as was seen in March and April 2020

in several EU/EEA countries and the UK. However, a set of control measures are now known to be effective in checking and reversing the trend towards increasing incidence within a period of about two-to-three weeks.

Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 incidence rising is assessed as moderate.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  All topics: A to Z  Coronavirus  Threats and outbreaks  COVID-19  Assessing the risk to the EU                   COVID-19            Situation updates on COVID-19    Assessing the risk to the EU    Facts    Latest evidence    Surveillance    Testing strategies    Laboratory support    Preparedness    Latest outputs    External resources               Risk assessment on COVID-19, 11 June 2020    Risk assessment      Twitter     Facebook     Linked In     Mail          What is the risk of COVID-19 to the general population as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak, which is phylogenetically in the SARS-CoV clade. The disease associated with the virus is referred to as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As of 11 March 2020, 118 598 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide by more than 100 countries. Since late February, the majority of cases reported are from outside China, with an increasing majority of these reported from EU/EEA countries and the UK.

The Director General of the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.

All EU/EEA countries and the UK are affected, reporting a total of 17 413 cases as of 11 March. Seven hundred and eleven cases reported by EU/EEA countries and the UK have died. Italy represents 58% of the cases (n=10 149) and 88% of the fatalities (n=631). The current pace of the increase in cases in the EU/EEA and the UK mirrors trends seen in China in January-early February and trends seen in Italy in mid-February.

Need for immediate targeted action

In the current situation where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading worldwide and the number of cases in Europe is rising with increasing pace in several affected areas, there is a need for immediate targeted action. The speed with which COVID-19 can cause nationally incapacitating epidemics once transmission within the community is established, indicates that in a few weeks or even days, it is likely that similar situations to those seen in China and Italy may be seen in other EU/EEA countries or the UK.

There are no vaccines available and there is little evidence on the effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents. In addition, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population against the new coronavirus and everyone in the population is assumed to be susceptible. Clinical presentations of COVID-19 range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia; severe disease can lead to death. While the majority of cases (80%) are milder respiratory infections and pneumonias, severe illness and death is more common among the elderly with other chronic underlying conditions, with these risk groups accounting for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to date.

Risk assessment

The risk of severe disease associated with COVID-19 infection for people in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered moderate for the general population and high for older adults and individuals with chronic underlying conditions, based on the probability of community transmission and the impact of the disease.

The risk of healthcare system capacity being exceeded in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is considered high. The impact and risk assessment on health system capacity can be mediated by the application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity measures.

The risk of transmission of COVID-19 in health and social institutions with large vulnerable populations is considered high. The impact of transmission in health and social institutions can be mediated by the application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity.

The EU/EEA and the UK are quickly moving toward a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19. The situation is evolving very quickly and a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential in order to delay transmission, as containing transmission to local epidemics is no longer considered feasible. A rapid shift from a containment to a mitigation approach is required, as the rapid increase in cases, that is anticipated in the coming days to few weeks may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to realise, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time. Measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems.

Necessary measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic

Given the current epidemiology and risk assessment, and the expected developments in the next days to few weeks, the following public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are necessary in EU/EEA countries:

Social distancing measures should be implemented early in order to mitigate the impact of the epidemic and to delay the epidemic peak. This can interrupt human-to-human transmission chains, prevent further spread, reduce the intensity of the epidemic and slow down the increase in cases, while allowing healthcare systems to prepare and cope with an increased influx of patients. Such measures should include: the immediate isolation of symptomatic persons suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19; the suspension of mass gatherings, taking into consideration the size of the event, the density of participants and if the event is in a confined indoor environment; social distancing measures at workplaces (for example teleworking, suspension of meetings, cancellation of non-essential travel); measures in and closure of schools, taking into consideration the uncertainty in the evidence of children in transmitting the disease, need for day care for children, impact on nursing staff, potential to increase transmission to vulnerable grandparents; cordon sanitaire of residential areas with high levels of community transmission.



Ensuring the public is aware of the seriousness of COVID-19. A high degree of population understanding, solidarity and discipline is required to apply strict personal hygiene, coughing etiquette, self-monitoring and social distancing measures. Community engagement and acceptance of stringent social distancing measures put in place are key in delaying and reducing further spread.

Prevention and control of COVID-19 in hospitals and long-term care facilities is an immediate priority in order to: (1) slow the demand for specialised healthcare, such as ICU beds; (2) safeguard populations vulnerable to severe outcomes of infection (3); protect healthcare workers that provide care; (4) minimise the export of cases to other healthcare facilities and the community.

Every healthcare facility should initiate training for all staff and those who may be required for healthcare provision during surge capacity. Countries should identify healthcare units that can be designated to care for COVID-19 cases, to minimise transmission to non-cases and to conserve PPE. Countries and healthcare institutions should identify additional facilities that can be used for the cohorting of cases with mild symptoms, in the event that surge capacity is exceeded by healthcare facilities. The highest priority for use of respirators (FFP2/3) are healthcare workers, in particular those performing aerosol-generating procedures, including swabbing.

If resources or capacity are limited, rational approaches should be implemented to prioritise high-yield actions, which include: rational use of confirmatory testing, reducing contact tracing to focus only on high-yield contacts, rational use of PPE and hospitalisation and implementing rational criteria for de-isolation. Testing approaches should prioritise vulnerable populations, protection of social and healthcare institutions, including staff.

National surveillance systems should initially aim at rapidly detecting cases and assessing community transmission. As the epidemic progresses, surveillance should monitor the intensity, geographical spread and the impact of the epidemic on the population and healthcare systems and assess the effectiveness of measures in place. In circumstances with capacity shortages and strict implementation of social distancing measures, surveillance should focus on severe acute respiratory infections, sentinel surveillance in outpatient clinics or collection of data through telephone helplines.

A strategic approach based on early and rigorous application of these measures will help reduce the burden and pressure on the healthcare system, and in particular on hospitals, and will allow more time for the testing of therapeutics and vaccine development.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  Publications & data  Rapid risk assessment: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK – sixth update                   Publications & data                Rapid risk assessment: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK – sixth update    Risk assessment   12 Mar 2020     Cite:    Citation Link     European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

During the course of the day on 22 February, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy. Initial case identification was based on local laboratory confirmations in the affected Region. Further confirmatory testing is being undertaken by the Italian national reference laboratory and extensive contact tracing is being performed. On 22 February, COVID-19 cases were also reported from two other Regions, Piedmont and Veneto. On 23 February Emilia-Romagna also reported cases. Transmission appears to not be first generation transmission from people travelling or returning from an affected area, but seems to have occurred locally. Transmission events have been reported to have occurred in hospitals, with COVID-19 cases identified among healthcare workers and patients. Two deaths among elderly people have been observed. COVID-19 cases have been identified in multiple

municipalities.

The information currently available about the different COVID-19 clusters of cases in four Regions in Italy is limited. The situation is dynamically evolving, with more cases expected in the coming days. The risk assessment for the EU/EEA might change when more data become available. The clusters are currently limited to a few Regions in northern Italy. No close contacts or other related cases have been reported to be linked to other European countries.

The risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people from the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered to be low to moderate.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

All previously reported cases in the EU/EEA and UK have clearly established epidemiological links; contact tracing measures have been in place to contain further spread. Extraordinary public health measures have been implemented in northern Italy and strong efforts are being made to identify, isolate and test contacts in order to contain the outbreak. The probability of further transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded because a high level of uncertainties with several unpredictable factors and a situation that is still evolving.

The possibility of new introductions from other countries outside China in the EU/EEA appears to be increasing as the number of non EU/EEA countries reporting cases keeps going up. Among the increasing number of countries reporting COVID-19 cases are Israel, Lebanon, Iran, and Egypt, while the number of cases in countries outside of China (South Korea, Japan) has been increasing over the last few days. This also increases the possibility of cases being introduced from other countries outside China by travellers to the EU/EEA.

The impact of sustained transmission in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, given that the reported case severity is high among these groups.

The risk of the occurrence of similar clusters, similar to the ones in Italy, associated with COVID-19 in other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently considered to be moderate to high.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

The current event in Italy indicates that local transmission may have resulted in several clusters for which an epidemiological link to areas where ongoing transmission is presumed, was not apparent. The accumulated evidence from clusters reported in the EU/EEA and the UK indicates that once imported, the virus causing COVID19 can transmit rapidly. This may emanate from cases with mild symptoms that do not provoke healthcare-seeking behaviour. The increases in cases and the number of countries outside China reporting those cases increases the potential routes of importation of the infection into the EU/EEA and the UK.

The impact of such clusters in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially if hospitals were affected and a large number of healthcare workers had to be isolated. The impact on vulnerable groups within affected hospitals or healthcare facilities is considered to be severe, in particular for the elderly.

The rigorous public health measures that were implemented immediately after identifying the Italian COVID-19 cases will reduce the impact of such outbreaks as well as the further spread.

The risk for people from the EU/EEA and the UK travelling/resident in areas with presumed community transmission is currently high.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

The overall number of reported cases in areas with community transmission is high or increasing. However, there are significant uncertainties regarding transmissibility and under-detection, particularly among mild or asymptomatic cases.

For travellers/residents, the impact of one or more infections is considered high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, because the reported case severity is high in these groups. The impact will also depend on the capacity and availability of healthcare during the epidemic.

The risk for healthcare systems capacity in the EU/EEA and the UK during the peak of the influenza season is low to moderate.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

As the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK remains low, the probability of widespread infection remains low during the peak of the 2019–2020 influenza season. The majority of countries reported widespread influenza activity for week 7/2020, but the proportion of specimens tested positive in sentinel surveillance is slightly decreasing; some EU/EEA countries might have already moved past the peak period of high influenza circulation: see https://flunewseurope.org.

If a significant increase in COVID-19 cases were to coincide with a high level of influenza activity, the potential impact on healthcare systems would be moderate to high. The increased number of cases would require additional resources for testing, case management, surveillance, and contact tracing. Increased transmission could result in further pressure on healthcare systems. This situation would be exacerbated should a substantial number of healthcare workers become infected.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  Publications & data  Threat assessment brief: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation in Italy                   Publications & data                Threat assessment brief: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation in Italy    Publication Risk assessment   23 Feb 2020        Twitter     Facebook     Linked In     Mail      During the course of the day on 22 February, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy.

Transmission appears to not be first generation transmission from people travelling or returning from an affected area, but seems to have occurred locally. Transmission events have been reported to have occurred in hospitals, with COVID-19 cases identified among healthcare workers and patients. Two deaths among elderly people have been observed. COVID-19 cases have been identified in multiple municipalities.  Executive summary   The information currently available about the different COVID-19 clusters of cases in four Regions in Italy is limited. The situation is dynamically evolving, with more cases expected in the coming days. The risk assessment for the EU/EEA might change when more data become available. The clusters are currently limited to a few Regions in northern Italy. No close contacts or other related cases have been reported to be linked to other European countries.  The risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people from the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered to be low to moderate.  This assessment is based on the following factors:  All previously reported cases in the EU/EEA and UK have clearly established epidemiological links; contact tracing measures have been in place to contain further spread. Extraordinary public health measures have been implemented in northern Italy and strong efforts are being made to identify, isolate and test contacts in order to contain the outbreak. The probability of further transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded because a high level of uncertainties with several unpredictable factors and a situation that is still evolving.  The possibility of new introductions from other countries outside China in the EU/EEA appears to be increasing as the number of non EU/EEA countries reporting cases keeps going up. Among the increasing number of countries reporting COVID-19 cases are Israel, Lebanon, Iran, and Egypt, while the number of cases in countries outside of China (South Korea, Japan) has been increasing over the last few days. This also increases the possibility of cases being introduced from other countries outside China by travellers to the EU/EEA.  The impact of sustained transmission in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, given that the reported case severity is high among these groups.  The risk of the occurrence of similar clusters, similar to the ones in Italy, associated with COVID-19 in other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently considered to be moderate to high.  This assessment is based on the following factors:  The current event in Italy indicates that local transmission may have resulted in several clusters for which an epidemiological link to areas where ongoing transmission is presumed, was not apparent. The accumulated evidence from clusters reported in the EU/EEA and the UK indicates that once imported, the virus causing COVID19 can transmit rapidly. This may emanate from cases with mild symptoms that do not provoke healthcare-seeking behaviour. The increases in cases and the number of countries outside China reporting those cases increases the potential routes of importation of the infection into the EU/EEA and the UK.  The impact of such clusters in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially if hospitals were affected and a large number of healthcare workers had to be isolated. The impact on vulnerable groups within affected hospitals or healthcare facilities is considered to be severe, in particular for the elderly.  The rigorous public health measures that were implemented immediately after identifying the Italian COVID-19 cases will reduce the impact of such outbreaks as well as the further spread.  The risk for people from the EU/EEA and the UK travelling/resident in areas with presumed community transmission is currently high.  This assessment is based on the following factors:  The overall number of reported cases in areas with community transmission is high or increasing. However, there are significant uncertainties regarding transmissibility and under-detection, particularly among mild or asymptomatic cases.  For travellers/residents, the impact of one or more infections is considered high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, because the reported case severity is high in these groups. The impact will also depend on the capacity and availability of healthcare during the epidemic.  The risk for healthcare systems capacity in the EU/EEA and the UK during the peak of the influenza season is low to moderate.  This assessment is based on the following factors:  As the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK remains low, the probability of widespread infection remains low during the peak of the 2019–2020 influenza season. The majority of countries reported widespread influenza activity for week 7/2020, but the proportion of specimens tested positive in sentinel surveillance is slightly decreasing; some EU/EEA countries might have already moved past the peak period of high influenza circulation: see https://flunewseurope.org .  If a significant increase in COVID-19 cases were to coincide with a high level of influenza activity, the potential impact on healthcare systems would be moderate to high. The increased number of cases would require additional resources for testing, case management, surveillance, and contact tracing. Increased transmission could result in further pressure on healthcare systems. This situation would be exacerbated should a substantial number of healthcare workers become infected.

9,chance die OR dying OR death ccp (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/03/23/a-mortality-perspective-on-covid-19-time-location-and-age/,"On March 22, 2020, at the time of writing, the total number of recorded deaths from the novel coronavirus stood at just below 14,000. This is a large number and is bound to increase, exponentially for a time, but it needs to be understood in context. It can be large or small depending on the time frame, the geographic scale, and the demographic composition of the population affected.

Time frame

The number of COVID-19 fatalities is small compared to the 12 million total number of people who have already died this year from all causes, but the numbers could reach 3.6 million in just eight weeks at the current pace of deaths doubling each week. In the counterfactual, without COVID-19, we would expect 60 million global deaths in 2020, with 18 million people dying from heart disease, 10 million from cancer, 6.5 million from respiratory diseases, 1.6 million from diarrhea, 1.5 million in road incidents, and 1 million deaths from HIV/AIDS. Suicides could number 800,000.

It’s hard to estimate the impact on total deaths from the COVID-19 disease because, in addition to the direct effects that are measured, there are also large indirect effects from the policy responses. For a start, the direct impact itself is totally unknown and unknowable at this point. There are too many uncertainties to have any sensible range of estimates. At one end, it looks as if China may be able to contain deaths to about 3,500 (they are at 3,260 with about eight to 10 new deaths each day). This is less than 0.03 percent of the 10.5 million people who are expected to die in China this year.

Even if we look more narrowly at February/March, when COVID-19 mortality was highest in China, it was still only the 49th cause of death in the country (Figure 1).

It seems unlikely that the tally will be so low in other countries. Italy already has more than 15 times the total confirmed coronavirus cases per million population as China, with no signs of the rate of increase of new cases slowing down sharply. Deaths have already surpassed China’s toll and, given the known caseload, will continue to grow rapidly for at least two weeks even if current more restrictive quarantining practices start to work. COVID-19 was already the eighth leading cause of death in Italy in February/March (Figure 2).

Italy, of course, will likely not be the worst affected country. Italy is an advanced economy with a strong public health system and large numbers of hospital beds, ventilators, and other essentials to keep death rates low. The havoc that could be wreaked in developing countries without such advantages is unimaginable. Standard measures in the West, like social distancing, could be impossible to implement in Calcutta, Dhaka, or Lagos.

Complicating matters further is the difficulty of understanding the indirect impact of COVID-19, which can be both positive and negative. François Gemenne, of the Hugo Observatory, has even argued that “the death toll of the coronavirus at the end of the day might be positive, if you consider the deaths from atmospheric pollution.” This is not such a far-fetched idea. During the lockdown in China, particulate emissions fell. Using conservative estimates from four major Chinese cities, Marshall Burke, from of Stanford University, projects that “the lives saved due to the pollution reductions are roughly 20x the number of lives that have been directly lost to the virus.” On the other hand, the overburdening of the health system due to COVID-19 will surely create suffering for people who need normal emergency support and if there is no economic foundation, countries won’t be able to finance their health care systems anymore.

Location

Many numbers seem small when expressed in per capita terms in a populous country like China. The direct deaths from COVID-19 in China may be only 0.03 percent of China’s estimated 10.5 million deaths this year. It may be 10 times as large if we just focus on the month of February. If we narrow in on Hubei province, then COVID-19 deaths would still represent less than 1 percent of estimated deaths for 2020, but almost 7 percent of all deaths in Hubei in February (Figure 3). For the city of Wuhan (not shown), COVID-19 could represent over 2 percent of all the deaths in 2020 and increased deaths in February by a quarter.

Age

In China, Italy, and elsewhere, deaths from COVID-19 have been concentrated among seniors. In China, more than 50 percent of COVID-19 deaths have been people who are over 70 years old even though most COVID-19 cases are being contracted by people below 70. Young people have interpreted this as an indication that they do not need to worry about the virus, while old people are being warned to take extreme caution. It is true that young people have a smaller chance than old people of dying from COVID-19, but they have a smaller chance of dying of almost any other health risk as well. In China, the age at which people died from COVID-19 was very similar to the age at which people died normally (Figure 4). And there are already signs that the age profile of deaths in China may not be the same as the age profile elsewhere, so it is useful for people of all ages to take extreme care.

Space and time matter

China’s experience highlights, in dramatic fashion, how national aggregates can be misleading. Space and time matter. What is a blip for China at the national level with a perspective of one year has been a major disaster for Wuhan at a time scale of one month. Understanding the human dimension of the tragedy starts with an understanding of the specifics of people, time, and place, the same principles that lie behind the “leave no one behind“ slogan of the U.N.’s Agenda 2030.

The data from China also show the impact of effective public action. China has contained the virus for now. But only a few weeks ago, Wuhan was the world’s COVID-19 battlefield. If the infection had been left unchecked, China would have experienced a dramatic outcome. Small numbers create big impacts if they grow exponentially. China’s 3,500 deaths would have translated into 3.6 million deaths after only 10 doublings (10 weeks in current COVID transmission terms). If you are currently living in quarantine and are unsure about the measures your government has imposed on you, trust the fundamentals of mathematics. If you see an exponential trend, you need to start social distancing very early. Otherwise the eventual impact will be beyond comprehension.

Read more What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser March 25, 2020  We thank Tom Chivers for editorial review and feedback on this work.  Reuse our work freely Coronavirus By country Data explorer Deaths Cases Tests Mortality risk Policy responses Exemplars All charts  There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate.

It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

The Diplomat author Mercy Kuo regularly engages subject-matter experts, policy practitioners, and strategic thinkers across the globe for their diverse insights into U.S. Asia policy. This conversation with Dr. Xun Zhou – reader in modern history at the University of Essex, expert on health intervention and delivery in China, and author of The People’s Health: Health Intervention and Delivery in Mao’s China, 1949-1983 (forthcoming) – discusses the origins of COVID-19 and the future of China’s health systems.

Explain the decision-making and authorization process behind health intervention and delivery in China.

After the SARS outbreak in 2003 exposed grave deficiencies in the Chinese health system and the increasing public complaints in China over unaffordability and low quality medical care, the Chinese authorities acknowledged that an efficient health system is pivotal to China’s overall social and economic development, the country’s stability, and the CCP’s political legitimacy as well as China’s image on the world stage. In 2009, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCCPC) and the State Council mandated major health reforms. The goal of this Healthy China Strategy is to establish an equitable and effective health system so that China would achieve Health for All by 2020. This entails strengthening healthcare delivery, health security, and provision of essential medicines.

At the top, the State Council set up a State Council Health System Reform Office to coordinate the relevant ministries to develop specific reform policies. The Office is also responsible for evaluating the reform work performed by different ministries as well as by provincial authorities. While this annual evaluation would have a direct impact on the allocation of the state health subsidy as well as promotion of individuals, neither the Office nor the relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Health responsible for formulating national policies have any real power over the implementation of the reform strategy.

To this day the health intervention, delivery, and financing systems remain fragmented. On the ground, each provincial authority is responsible for allocating resources to implement national-level health policies, which may be at odds with local interests. They often treat national policies as merely guidelines, and are not obliged to implement them, whether due to lack of funding, resources, or local interests. On the other hand, with their eyes fixed on more state subsidies and the next opportunity for promotion, local authorities and officials are always more interested in showing their superior in Beijing how well any specific locality is doing in terms of health, rather than being seen as a problem. Even at the national level, health resources in China are managed by different sectors. Coordination between them has always been problematic. In crisis situations, such as during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the COVID-19 outbreak early this year, such fragmentation severely impeded crisis management.

Identify the factors behind growing international pressure to investigate China’s handling of COVID-19 domestically and with the World Health Organization (WHO).

The COVID-19 crisis that first took hold in Wuhan in central China exposed the Chinese authorities’ consistent lack of transparency in acknowledging any disease outbreaks threatening public health. Local and national authorities’ unwillingness to report the onset of the outbreak as well as their failure to acknowledge the resulting tragedy in Wuhan turned it into as much a man-made catastrophe as a biological one. More importantly China’s reluctance to share uncensored information with international communities has led some of its Western critics to condemn Beijing. In the United States, capitalizing on the growing public distrust of China that was fanned prior to the outbreak, several leading Republicans have waged a major anti-China campaign aimed at diverting voters’ attention away from the Trump administration’s local mismanagement of the pandemic.

In the U.S. war on COVID-19, China is portrayed as the “Patient Zero” that has contaminated the rest of the globe, and hence is responsible for costing nearly 30 million American jobs as well as the federal government trillions of dollars in emergency spending. China is blamed for the deepening economic recession not only in the United States but globally. Around the world, as a variety of interests intersected to replicate the horror of the pandemic in different contexts, China has become the ultimate scapegoat. Australian Prime Minster Scott Morrison, for instance, has accused China of having caused the huge loss of lives across the world as well as the global economic shutdown.

The WHO now serves as a political and diplomatic arena in the current health/diplomatic war between the U.S. and China. This is not new, however. From its onset, as pointed out by one of its founding fathers, Dr. Sze Szeming, the WHO has really had more to do with politics than medicine and health. As my book illustrates, throughout the Cold War, the United States, China, and the USSR regularly used the World Health Assembly (WHA) as a political and diplomatic arena to battle each other. China, for example, after rejoining of the WHO in 1973, began to use the WHA meetings to promote its new Third World policy and to combat the First World “superpowers” such as the USSR and the United States.

Explain the correlation between the CCP’s legitimacy and ability to control the COVID-19 narrative on domestic and global health policy as well as geopolitics.

Throughout Chinese history, epidemic, war, and natural disasters, including famine, had been seen as signs indicating the loss of the Mandate of Heaven that inexorably led to the downfall of many dynasties. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC) politics and health have always been inextricably linked. After the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seized power in 1949, locally endemic diseases such as schistosomiasis were seen as threats to people’s livelihood, social stability, and national security. Public health campaigns aimed at eradicating such diseases linked allopathic medicine and public health work with the ongoing legitimization of the new order. Fighting the disease came to stand for fighting for socialism. As such the CCP leadership made eradicating diseases and improving the health of the entire population a central pillar of its policies. As the promise to improve the people’s health has been a central tool utilized by the CCP in establishing political legitimacy, its failure to deliver such promise could also cost the party its legitimacy. Hence, the CCP’s campaign to control COVID-19 is simultaneously political. At the same time, as public health work in the PRC has served as one of the central means of impacting and influencing the masses, the CCP has also turned the political campaign to combat COVID-19 into a moral crusade involving the entire Chinese nation. This way, the CCP has managed, with some success, to rally support from a large section of the population.

Nationalism is on the rise in China. In the meantime, with the spread of disease globally as well as the xenophobic anti-Chinese discourse in some Western countries, the official propaganda in China is turning COVID-19 into an external menace. This has allowed the CCP to further gain support from Chinese populations both within China and overseas in an alleged “united” effort or “common goal” to fight the disease. Such nationalistic rhetoric is also diverting people’s attention away from the earlier tragedy in Wuhan.

Globally, capitalizing on the growing crisis in the United States and Europe, the official media in China has been trumpeting China’s purported success in controlling the disease. China has also sent medical missions to countries such as Italy. Sending medical missions abroad had been a strategy the PRC used during the Cold War to promote a new international order: a “people’s revolutionary movement” against colonialism, imperialism, and hegemonism. In the 1970s, the PRC’s increasing medical “humanitarian” activities, and the bonds of friendship created through such undertakings, helped the PRC win its battle against the Republic of China (Taiwan) for the permanent “Chinese” seat at the UN’s Security Council and membership in the General Assembly. This time, the PRC’s medical “humanitarian” efforts have once again won praise from the WHO as well as those who wish to criticize the Trump administration or their own government’s failures in tackling the crisis. On the other hand, it’s also ironic that while health and humanitarianism played pivotal roles in the political and diplomatic negotiations within the White House that eventually led to the opening to China in the early 1970s, currently both the White House and Beijing are using health as a weapon to engage in a new Cold War.

Assess the CCP’s strategy to counter global calls for China to be held accountable.

With mounting pressure from some Western countries threatening to bring China to international courts, China has become the global pariah for failing to alert the world about the outbreak. Faced with such a challenge, the CCP, assisted by its official media and the scientific community in China, has been working hard to try turn the tide by propagating itself as a global hero for its successful containment. At the same time, Beijing has launched a major propaganda campaign, backed up by purported scientific evidence, blaming the U.S. military for bringing the disease to Wuhan in the first place. Such strategy is nothing new, however. It resonates with the CCP’s campaign against the alleged American “germ warfare” during the Korean War in the 1950s. On the other hand, China has launched a diplomatic as well as propaganda campaign to attack Western “imperialists” by evoking the memory of the “Hundred Year National Humiliation.” In it, the COVID-19 is the new “opium plague” that the West, in particularly the United States, is using to hobble China’s rise. But this time, China is determined to not be defeated.

Similar to what happened in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Incident in 1989, the CCP leadership took to the decision that China would remain open to the outside world, and perhaps open wider than before. While last time, Deng Xiaoping sought the help of his “old friend” President George H. W. Bush of the United States to get China out of the crisis of international isolation, this time President Xi Jinping of China telephoned President Putin of Russia to agree on building stronger ties. Stating that “the attempt by some to smear China on the question of the origin of the virus is unacceptable,” Putin assured Xi that “Russia is ready to continue to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with China in fighting COVID-19 and in other areas.”

The day after Xi and Putin’s communication, on April 17 at the CCCPC Politburo meeting, it was announced that China would “facilitate the smooth flow of international logistics, strictly control the quality of epidemic prevention and control supplies for export and jointly advance high-quality development under the Belt and Road Initiative.” On the same day, the Wuhan authority published a revised mortality and morbidity figure that increased the city’s total COVID-19 death toll by 50 percent. That took the national total in China to more than 4,600. The official statement states that this revision was a result of efforts by authorities to “ensure that information on the city’s COVID-19 epidemic is open, transparent and the data [is] accurate.” At the exact moment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman attacked the United States’ accusations of a cover-up by China as false: “We’ll never allow any concealment,” he said. Clearly China has crafted this new statistical campaign to deter external criticism. At the same time, by ceremoniously increasing the mortality figure, authorities hope to win back people’s trust, hence to ensure the stability of the country.

With U.S. and European policymakers questioning China’s credibility on health policy and data transparency, why does cooperation between Chinese and Western scientists and health experts remain crucial to containing COVID-19?

In the past 40 years, the West had made much effort to integrate China into the neoliberal world order. This Western enthusiasm to draw China in had been matched by China’s willingness to participate in it. China’s ascendance to the world’s second biggest economy, however, has had unintended and catastrophic consequences. Rapid modernization accompanied by unrestricted deforestation and unprecedented scale urbanization have threatened the capacity and resilience of the country’s ecosystems. The ever-increasing human efforts to exploit land, from agricultural expansion and intensification – including the animal husbandry industry to produce high protein food for human consumption due to the rise in living standards – to the construction of roads, railways, mining, and other large scale modernization projects such as the Three Gorges Dam drove much wildlife into populated areas due to the loss of habitats and led to closer integration between livestock and wildlife. This has increased human exposure to new pathogens threatened public health.

South of the Yangtze River, including the regions around Wuhan, as well as China’s southwest have become the “golden triangle,” the ideal environment for the emergence and transmission of a number of infectious diseases (EID), from SARS to the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and COVID-19. All are zoonotic in origin. Yet China is not alone in this nor is China the sole culprit for the pandemic the world is now experiencing. Throughout history, the link between modernity, globalization, and epidemics is obvious. The expansion of global trade and travel have set us free but also left us exposed, ever more vulnerable. Geographical distance, the barrier that used to separate us but also slowed the transmission of infectious diseases, has been mitigated with our improved transportation network.

Today, in China as in much of the world, to catch an airplane is likened to catching a bus. The improved and increased aviation has also accelerated the spread of diseases and the rapidity of occurrence of a pandemic such as the COVID-19. The connectedness of everything in this universe, not only in geographic proximity, also meant science can no longer just rely on isolating particular causes and their effects. There is more than ever before a greater urgency and need for a better understanding of the drivers and causes of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases as well as for closer collaboration between international agencies and national governments together with scientists and health experts across the world and disciplines to strengthen animal and public health surveillance, response, prevention, and preparedness systems at the national, regional, and international levels.","Our World in Data Articles by topic Latest About Donate All charts Sustainable Development Goals Tracker Coronavirus pandemic : daily updated research and data.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

9,chance die OR dying OR death ccp (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),5,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/03/06/commentary/world-commentary/covid-19-crisis-reveals-ccps-true-colors/,"Crises bring out the best and worst of individuals and organizations. The COVID-19 outbreak highlights what some would say is a strength of the Chinese political system: the ability to make quick and bold policy adjustments, such as shutting down travel between large Chinese cities and enforcing restrictions on banned public activity.

But the health crisis also reminds us of an unpleasant truth about the Chinese Communist Party: For all the talk from Chinese officials and state-approved commentators about how the rise of China is good for the world, the overwhelming and driving objective of the CCP is its own survival.

The world increasingly understands that the Chinese government is bent on controlling the discussion of China-related issues not only within but also outside of China.

In recent years we have seen many examples of this, including the controversy in the United States over the Confucian Institutes; Beijing punishing multiple countries for hosting the Dalai Lama; the Chinese television blackout of National Basketball Association games over a team executive’s tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters; Beijing drastically cutting Chinese tourism to Palau because the Pacific island nation has diplomatic relations with Taiwan; the Chinese government’s threat to close the China market to large U.S. corporations because their websites implied Taiwan is a separate country from China; and Beijing forcing Hollywood to alter the content of movies before allowing them into China.

Foreigners might think the price they pay for their addiction to Chinese money is limited to accommodating Beijing’s sensitivity on a few sovereignty issues. This is relatively painless, as foreign businesses are largely indifferent about these issues, considering them arcane. In any case the access to Chinese wealth seemingly makes the required adjustments worthwhile.

What the beneficiaries of China’s economic largesse fail to realize is that when Beijing perceives it can exploit its leverage to make demands of a partner, those demands are likely to grow in variety and scope. Eventually Beijing will call in a favor that causes a business partner difficulty and pain.

In return for economic development assistance from China, the Cambodian government is ceding national territory to Chinese control (probably for a Chinese naval base). The president of the Philippines is weakening his country’s alliance with the U.S. China used an economic boycott to enforce a Chinese veto over a South Korean policy to deploy a defensive system against North Korean missiles that China disapproved of.

When Papua New Guinea, the recipient of much Chinese aid, hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in 2018, the Chinese delegation felt entitled to attempt to force its way into the PNG foreign minister’s office and demand a revision of the final group communique, prompting a call to security personnel to expel them.

The COVID-19 crisis has seen similar but perhaps more serious behavior by the Chinese government. The origin of the virus in China, and particularly the bans within foreign countries against travel from China, are embarrassments to the CCP leadership. Therefore Beijing has demanded early lifting of the travel bans, despite the continued high number of cases in China and justified suspicions that the Chinese government is not reporting the full extent of the problem. On Feb. 18, China’s ambassador to the Philippines, Huang Xilian, publicly threatened that if the Philippines did not lift its travel ban, China might retaliate by cutting its imports of Philippine bananas. This was a moment of clarity about how the CCP operates.

The travel bans against China through the month of February were amply justified. Indeed, by late February the Chinese were themselves doing what they condemned foreigners for doing, as provincial governments tightened their screening and quarantines of foreigners entering China out of fear that outsiders would bring in more of the virus. So the CCP was telling a trade partner: “Your policy makes us look bad. We will use our economic leverage to punish you if you don’t change your policy and we don’t care if that would put your citizens at greater risk of illness and death.”

When the CCP feels threatened, we should not expect to see anything other than Beijing utilizing any available means of influence to reduce the threat, to shift the blame away from the central government and to pass the costs of protecting the party onto others. The foreign businesses that profit from their dependence on China march themselves into this realm of vulnerability, where the CCP’s internal insecurities become problems for outsiders, and nothing matters more than saving the face of the Chinese leadership.

The COVID-19 outbreak highlights what some would say is a strength of the Chinese political system: the ability to make quick and bold policy adjustments, such as shutting down travel between large Chinese cities and enforcing restrictions on banned public activity. But the health crisis also reminds us of an unpleasant truth about the Chinese Communist Party: For all the talk from Chinese officials and state-approved commentators about how the rise of China is good for the world, the overwhelming and driving objective of the CCP is its own survival.    The world increasingly understands that the Chinese government is bent on controlling the discussion of China-related issues not only within but also outside of China. In recent years we have seen many examples of this, including the controversy in the United States over the Confucian Institutes; Beijing punishing multiple countries for hosting the Dalai Lama; the Chinese television blackout of National Basketball Association games over a team executive’s tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters; Beijing drastically cutting Chinese tourism to Palau because the Pacific island nation has diplomatic relations with Taiwan; the Chinese government’s threat to close the China market to large U.S. corporations because their websites implied Taiwan is a separate country from China; and Beijing forcing Hollywood to alter the content of movies before allowing them into China. Foreigners might think the price they pay for their addiction to Chinese money is limited to accommodating Beijing’s sensitivity on a few sovereignty issues. This is relatively painless, as foreign businesses are largely indifferent about these issues, considering them arcane. In any case the access to Chinese wealth seemingly makes the required adjustments worthwhile. What the beneficiaries of China’s economic largesse fail to realize is that when Beijing perceives it can exploit its leverage to make demands of a partner, those demands are likely to grow in variety and scope. Eventually Beijing will call in a favor that causes a business partner difficulty and pain. In return for economic development assistance from China, the Cambodian government is ceding national territory to Chinese control (probably for a Chinese naval base). The president of the Philippines is weakening his country’s alliance with the U.S. China used an economic boycott to enforce a Chinese veto over a South Korean policy to deploy a defensive system against North Korean missiles that China disapproved of. When Papua New Guinea, the recipient of much Chinese aid, hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in 2018, the Chinese delegation felt entitled to attempt to force its way into the PNG foreign minister’s office and demand a revision of the final group communique, prompting a call to security personnel to expel them. The COVID-19 crisis has seen similar but perhaps more serious behavior by the Chinese government. The origin of the virus in China, and particularly the bans within foreign countries against travel from China, are embarrassments to the CCP leadership. Therefore Beijing has demanded early lifting of the travel bans, despite the continued high number of cases in China and justified suspicions that the Chinese government is not reporting the full extent of the problem. On Feb. 18, China’s ambassador to the Philippines, Huang Xilian, publicly threatened that if the Philippines did not lift its travel ban, China might retaliate by cutting its imports of Philippine bananas. This was a moment of clarity about how the CCP operates. The travel bans against China through the month of February were amply justified. Indeed, by late February the Chinese were themselves doing what they condemned foreigners for doing, as provincial governments tightened their screening and quarantines of foreigners entering China out of fear that outsiders would bring in more of the virus. So the CCP was telling a trade partner: “Your policy makes us look bad. We will use our economic leverage to punish you if you don’t change your policy and we don’t care if that would put your citizens at greater risk of illness and death.” When the CCP feels threatened, we should not expect to see anything other than Beijing utilizing any available means of influence to reduce the threat, to shift the blame away from the central government and to pass the costs of protecting the party onto others. The foreign businesses that profit from their dependence on China march themselves into this realm of vulnerability, where the CCP’s internal insecurities become problems for outsiders, and nothing matters more than saving the face of the Chinese leadership.

Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one.  What do your results mean?  If you test positive   A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.  Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 may provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies may provide or how long this protection may last.  Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Your provider may suggest you take a second type of antibody test to see if the first test was accurate.  You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again.  If you work in a job where you wear personal protective equipment (PPE), continue wearing PPE.    You may test positive for antibodies even if you have never had symptoms of COVID-19. This can happen if you had an infection without symptoms, which is called an asymptomatic infection.   If you test negative   You may not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means.  You could still have a current infection.  The test may be negative because it typically takes 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. It’s possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently. This means you could still spread the virus.  Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people who are infected may not ever develop antibodies.     If you get symptoms after the antibody test, you might need another test called a viral test​ .

10,(testing|test|blood test) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/serology-testing.html,"CDC has developed a laboratory test to help estimate how many people in the United States have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Clinicians and researchers refer to this as a serology test, and many commercial laboratories call it an antibody test. CDC is using this serologic (antibody) test to evaluate the performance of commercial antibody tests. CDC will develop guidance for the use of antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.

An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. Antibody test results are especially important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms.

We do not know if the antibodies that result from SARS-CoV-2 infection will provide someone with protection (immunity) from getting infected again. If antibodies do provide immunity, we don’t know how much antibody is protective or how long protection might last. CDC scientists are currently conducting studies to answer these questions.

CDC’s serologic test has been designed and validated for surveillance and research purposes. It is designed to estimate the percentage of the U.S. population previously infected with the virus – information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public’s health.

The CDC test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Commercial tests are available to provide test results to individuals.

CDC is evaluating the performance of commercial antibody tests

Commercially manufactured antibody tests check for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals and are available through healthcare providers and commercial laboratories. CDC is evaluating the performance of these tests in collaboration with the following federal organizations:

Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

National Institutes of Health

Department of Defense

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy

Results from the initial federal evaluation are included in FDA’s EUA Authorized Serology Test Performanceexternal icon and will be updated as more tests are evaluated.

Read CDC’s interim guidelines for using antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.

About CDC’s serologic test

CDC’s serologic test is an ELISA-based testexternal icon to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or plasma components of blood. It uses purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein (no live virus) as antigen (designed by the Vaccine Research Centerexternal icon at the National Institutes of Health).

CDC’s serologic test is designed to detect antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 and minimize cross-reactivity to antibodies generated to other common coronaviruses that cause less severe illnesses, such as colds. However, potential cross-reactivity cannot be completely ruled out.

CDC’s serologic test has a specificity of greater than 99% and a sensitivity of 96% based on initial performance evaluations. It can be used to identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection in people who were infected at least 1 to 3 weeks previously.

CDC serology surveillance strategy

CDC has a strategy for using antibody testing as part of surveillance efforts to better understand how much of the U.S. population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and how the virus is spreading through the population over time.

Clinicians and researchers refer to this as a serology test , and many commercial laboratories call it an antibody test . CDC is using this serologic (antibody) test to evaluate the performance of commercial antibody tests. CDC will develop guidance for the use of antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.  An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. Antibody test results are especially important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms.  We do not know if the antibodies that result from SARS-CoV-2 infection will provide someone with protection (immunity) from getting infected again. If antibodies do provide immunity, we don’t know how much antibody is protective or how long protection might last. CDC scientists are currently conducting studies to answer these questions.  CDC’s serologic test has been designed and validated for surveillance and research purposes. It is designed to estimate the percentage of the U.S. population previously infected with the virus – information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public’s health.  The CDC test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Commercial tests are available to provide test results to individuals.  CDC is evaluating the performance of commercial antibody tests  Commercially manufactured antibody tests check for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals and are available through healthcare providers and commercial laboratories. CDC is evaluating the performance of these tests in collaboration with the following federal organizations:   Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  National Institutes of Health  Department of Defense  White House Office of Science and Technology Policy   Results from the initial federal evaluation are included in FDA’s EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance external icon and will be updated as more tests are evaluated.  Read CDC’s interim guidelines for using antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.  About CDC’s serologic test  CDC’s serologic test is an ELISA-based test external icon to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or plasma components of blood. It uses purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein (no live virus) as antigen (designed by the Vaccine Research Center external icon at the National Institutes of Health).  CDC’s serologic test is designed to detect antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 and minimize cross-reactivity to antibodies generated to other common coronaviruses that cause less severe illnesses, such as colds. However, potential cross-reactivity cannot be completely ruled out.  CDC’s serologic test has a specificity of greater than 99% and a sensitivity of 96% based on initial performance evaluations. It can be used to identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection in people who were infected at least 1 to 3 weeks previously.  CDC serology surveillance strategy  CDC has a strategy for using antibody testing as part of surveillance efforts to better understand how much of the U.S. population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and how the virus is spreading through the population over time.

Es posible que una prueba de anticuerpos no muestre si actualmente tiene una infección por el virus que causa el COVID-19 porque su organismo puede tardar de 1 a 3 semanas en generar anticuerpos luego de una infección. Para saber si tiene una infección en curso, debe hacerse una prueba viral . Las pruebas virales se usan para identificar el virus en muestras de su sistema respiratorio, como un hisopado del interior de su nariz.  Si el resultado de su prueba de detección de COVID-19, ya sea viral o de anticuerpos, es positivo o negativo, de cualquier manera debe tomar medidas de prevención para protegerse y proteger a los demás .  Todavía no sabemos si las personas que se recuperan del COVID-19 pueden infectarse nuevamente.  Los científicos están trabajando para averiguarlo.         ícono de médico y conversación   Autoverificador  Una guía para ayudarle a tomar decisiones y buscar la atención médica que necesita.

Las decisiones acerca de realizar o no pruebas de detección están a cargo de los departamentos de salud estatales o locales ícono de sitio externo o de los proveedores de atención médica.​  Las pruebas para detectar anticuerpos de COVID-19 están disponibles a través de proveedores de atención médica y laboratorios. Consulte a su proveedor de atención médica para ver si ofrece pruebas de anticuerpos y si es necesario que se haga una.  ¿Qué significan sus resultados?  Si el resultado de su prueba es positivo   Una prueba con resultado positivo muestra que puede tener anticuerpos de una infección por el virus que causa el COVID-19. Sin embargo, existe la posibilidad de que un resultado positivo signifique que tiene anticuerpos de una infección por un virus de la misma familia (llamada coronavirus), como el que causa el resfriado común.  El hecho de tener anticuerpos contra el virus que causa el COVID-19 puede protegerlo de ser infectado por el virus nuevamente. Si esto ocurre, no sabemos qué nivel de protección pueden aportar los anticuerpos ni cuánto puede durar.  Hable con su proveedor de atención médica acerca del resultado de su prueba y el tipo de prueba que se hizo para saber qué significa el resultado. Es posible que su proveedor le sugiera un segundo tipo de prueba de anticuerpos para ver si los resultados de la primera prueba fueron precisos.  Debe seguir tomando medidas para protegerse y proteger a los demás ya que podría ser infectado por el virus nuevamente.  Si trabaja en un empleo en el que debe usar equipo de protección personal (EPP), siga usándolo.    Puede tener un resultado positivo en la prueba de anticuerpos incluso si nunca tuvo síntomas de COVID-19. Esto puede suceder si tuvo la infección sin síntomas, llamada infección asintomática.   Si el resultado de su prueba es negativo   Puede no haber tenido COVID-19 nunca. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica acerca del resultado de su prueba y el tipo de prueba que se hizo para saber qué significa el resultado.  De todos modos, podría tener una infección en curso.  La prueba puede ser negativa porque, por lo general, el organismo desarrolla anticuerpos 1 a 3 semanas después de la infección. Sigue siendo posible que se enferme si estuvo expuesto al virus en el último tiempo. Esto significa que igual podría propagar el virus.  Algunas personas demoran más en crear anticuerpos, y algunas que fueron infectadas por el virus pueden directamente no desarrollar anticuerpos.     Si presenta síntomas luego de una prueba de anticuerpos, podría necesitar someterse a otra prueba llamada prueba viral​ .  Más allá de que su resultado sea positivo o negativo, esto no confirma si puede propagar el virus que causa el COVID-19.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests.

A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.

An antibody test might tell you if you had a past infection. An antibody test might not show if you have a current infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19 on a viral or an antibody test, you still should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.

11,(false negative|false-negative) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200610094112.htm,"In a new study, Johns Hopkins researchers found that testing people for SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID-19 -- too early in the course of infection is likely to result in a false negative test, even though they may eventually test positive for the virus.

A report on the findings was published in the May 13 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

""A negative test, whether or not a person has symptoms, doesn't guarantee that they aren't infected by the virus,"" says Lauren Kucirka, M.D., Ph.D., M.Sc., obstetrics and gynecology resident at Johns Hopkins Medicine. ""How we respond to, and interpret, a negative test is very important because we place others at risk when we assume the test is perfect. However, those infected with the virus are still able to potentially spread the virus.""

Kucirka says patients who have a high-risk exposure should be treated as if they are infected, particularly if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19. This means communicating with patients about the tests' shortcomings. One of several ways to assess for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a method called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These tests rapidly make copies of and detect the virus's genetic material. However, as shown in tests for other viruses such as influenza, if a swab misses collecting cells infected with the virus, or if virus levels are very low early during the infection, some RT-PCR tests can produce negative results. Since the tests return relatively rapid results, they have been widely used among high-risk populations such as nursing home residents, hospitalized patients and health care workers. Previous studies have shown or suggested false negatives in these populations.

For the new analysis, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers reviewed RT-PCR test data from seven prior studies, including two preprints and five peer-reviewed articles. The studies covered a combined total of 1,330 respiratory swab samples from a variety of subjects including hospitalized patients and those identified via contact tracing in an outpatient setting.

Using RT-PCR test results, along with reported time of exposure to the virus or time of onset of measurable symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing problems, the researchers calculated the probability that someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 would have a negative test result when they had the virus infection. In the published studies, health care providers collected nasal and throat samples -from patients and noted the time of virus exposure or symptom -onset and sample collection.

From this data, the Johns Hopkins researchers calculated daily false-negative rates, and have made their statistical code and data publicly available so results can be updated as more data are published.

The researchers estimated that those tested with SARS-CoV-2 in the four days after infection were 67% more likely to test negative, even if they had the virus. When the average patient began displaying symptoms of the virus, the false-negative rate was 38%. The test performed best eight days after infection (on average, three days after symptom onset), but even then had a false negative rate of 20%, meaning one in five people who had the virus had a negative test result.

""We are using these tests to rule out COVID-19, and basing decisions about what steps we take to prevent onward transmission, such as selection of personal protective equipment for health care workers,"" says Kucirka. ""As we develop strategies to reopen services, businesses and other venues that rely on testing and contact tracing, it is important to understand the limitations of these tests.""

Ongoing efforts to improve tests and better understand their performance in a variety of contexts will be critical as more people are infected with the virus and more testing is required. The sooner people can be accurately tested and isolated from others, the better we can control the spread of the virus, the researchers say.

11,(false negative|false-negative) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2015897,"Interactive Graphic

There is broad consensus that widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is essential to safely reopening the United States. A big concern has been test availability, but test accuracy may prove a larger long-term problem.

While debate has focused on the accuracy of antibody tests, which identify prior infection, diagnostic testing, which identifies current infection, has received less attention. But inaccurate diagnostic tests undermine efforts at containment of the pandemic.

Diagnostic tests (typically involving a nasopharyngeal swab) can be inaccurate in two ways. A false positive result erroneously labels a person infected, with consequences including unnecessary quarantine and contact tracing. False negative results are more consequential, because infected persons — who might be asymptomatic — may not be isolated and can infect others.

Given the need to know how well diagnostic tests rule out infection, it’s important to review assessment of test accuracy by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and clinical researchers, as well as interpretation of test results in a pandemic.

The FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to commercial test manufacturers and issued guidance on test validation.1 The agency requires measurement of analytic and clinical test performance. Analytic sensitivity indicates the likelihood that the test will be positive for material containing any virus strains and the minimum concentration the test can detect. Analytic specificity indicates the likelihood that the test will be negative for material containing pathogens other than the target virus.

Clinical evaluations, assessing performance of a test on patient specimens, vary among manufacturers. The FDA prefers the use of “natural clinical specimens” but has permitted the use of “contrived specimens” produced by adding viral RNA or inactivated virus to leftover clinical material. Ordinarily, test-performance studies entail having patients undergo an index test and a “reference standard” test determining their true state. Clinical sensitivity is the proportion of positive index tests in patients who in fact have the disease in question. Sensitivity, and its measurement, may vary with the clinical setting. For a sick person, the reference-standard test is likely to be a clinical diagnosis, ideally established by an independent adjudication panel whose members are unaware of the index-test results. For SARS-CoV-2, it is unclear whether the sensitivity of any FDA-authorized commercial test has been assessed in this way. Under the EUAs, the FDA does allow companies to demonstrate clinical test performance by establishing the new test’s agreement with an authorized reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test in known positive material from symptomatic people or contrived specimens. Use of either known positive or contrived samples may lead to overestimates of test sensitivity, since swabs may miss infected material in practice.1

Designing a reference standard for measuring the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 tests in asymptomatic people is an unsolved problem that needs urgent attention to increase confidence in test results for contact-tracing or screening purposes. Simply following people for the subsequent development of symptoms may be inadequate, since they may remain asymptomatic yet be infectious. Assessment of clinical sensitivity in asymptomatic people had not been reported for any commercial test as of June 1, 2020.

Two studies from Wuhan, China, arouse concern about false negative RT-PCR tests in patients with apparent Covid-19 illness. In a preprint, Yang et al. described 213 patients hospitalized with Covid-19, of whom 37 were critically ill.2 They collected 205 throat swabs, 490 nasal swabs, and 142 sputum samples (median, 3 per patient) and used an RT-PCR test approved by the Chinese regulator. In days 1 through 7 after onset of illness, 11% of sputum, 27% of nasal, and 40% of throat samples were deemed falsely negative. Zhao et al. studied 173 hospitalized patients with acute respiratory symptoms and a chest CT “typical” of Covid-19, or SARS-CoV-2 detected in at least one respiratory specimen. Antibody seroconversion was observed in 93%.3 RT-PCR testing of respiratory samples taken on days 1 through 7 of hospitalization were SARS-CoV-2–positive in at least one sample from 67% of patients. Neither study reported using an independent panel, unaware of index-test results, to establish a final diagnosis of Covid-19 illness, which may have biased the researchers toward overestimating sensitivity.

In a preprint systematic review of five studies (not including the Yang and Zhao studies), involving 957 patients (“under suspicion of Covid-19” or with “confirmed cases”), false negatives ranged from 2 to 29%.4 However, the certainty of the evidence was considered very low because of the heterogeneity of sensitivity estimates among the studies, lack of blinding to index-test results in establishing diagnoses, and failure to report key RT-PCR characteristics.4 Taken as a whole, the evidence, while limited, raises concern about frequent false negative RT-PCR results.

If SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were perfect, a positive test would mean that someone carries the virus and a negative test that they do not. With imperfect tests, a negative result means only that a person is less likely to be infected. To calculate how likely, one can use Bayes’ theorem, which incorporates information about both the person and the accuracy of the test (recently reviewed5). For a negative test, there are two key inputs: pretest probability — an estimate, before testing, of the person’s chance of being infected — and test sensitivity. Pretest probability might depend on local Covid-19 prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 exposure history, and symptoms. Ideally, clinical sensitivity and specificity of each test would be measured in various clinically relevant real-life situations (e.g., varied specimen sources, timing, and illness severity).

Assume that an RT-PCR test was perfectly specific (always negative in people not infected with SARS-CoV-2) and that the pretest probability for someone who, say, was feeling sick after close contact with someone with Covid-19 was 20%. If the test sensitivity were 95% (95% of infected people test positive), the post-test probability of infection with a negative test would be 1%, which might be low enough to consider someone uninfected and may provide them assurance in visiting high-risk relatives. The post-test probability would remain below 5% even if the pretest probability were as high as 50%, a more reasonable estimate for someone with recent exposure and early symptoms in a “hot spot” area.

But sensitivity for many available tests appears to be substantially lower: the studies cited above suggest that 70% is probably a reasonable estimate. At this sensitivity level, with a pretest probability of 50%, the post-test probability with a negative test would be 23% — far too high to safely assume someone is uninfected.

Chance of SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Given a Negative Test Result, According to Pretest Probability. The blue line represents a test with sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 95%. The green line represents a test with sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95%. The shading is the threshold for considering a person not to be infected (asserted to be 5%). Arrow A indicates that with the lower-sensitivity test, this threshold cannot be reached if the pretest probability exceeds about 15%. Arrow B indicates that for the higher-sensitivity test, the threshold can be reached up to a pretest probability of about 33%. An of this graph is available at NEJM.org.

The graph shows how the post-test probability of infection varies with the pretest probability for tests with low (70%) and high (95%) sensitivity. The horizontal line indicates a probability threshold below which it would be reasonable to act as if the person were uninfected (e.g., allowing the person to visit an elderly grandmother). Where this threshold should be set — here, 5% — is a value judgment and will vary with context (e.g., lower for people visiting a high-risk relative). The threshold highlights why very sensitive diagnostic tests are needed. With a negative result on the low-sensitivity test, the threshold is exceeded when the pretest probability exceeds 15%, but with a high-sensitivity test, one can have a pretest probability of up to 33% and still, assuming the 5% threshold, be considered safe to be in contact with others.

The graph also highlights why efforts to reduce pretest probability (e.g., by social distancing, possibly wearing masks) matter. If the pretest probability gets too high (above 50%, for example), testing loses its value because negative results cannot lower the probability of infection enough to reach the threshold.

We draw several conclusions. First, diagnostic testing will help in safely opening the country, but only if the tests are highly sensitive and validated under realistic conditions against a clinically meaningful reference standard. Second, the FDA should ensure that manufacturers provide details of tests’ clinical sensitivity and specificity at the time of market authorization; tests without such information will have less relevance to patient care.

Third, measuring test sensitivity in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority. It will also be important to develop methods (e.g., prediction rules) for estimating the pretest probability of infection (for asymptomatic and symptomatic people) to allow calculation of post-test probabilities after positive or negative results. Fourth, negative results even on a highly sensitive test cannot rule out infection if the pretest probability is high, so clinicians should not trust unexpected negative results (i.e., assume a negative result is a “false negative” in a person with typical symptoms and known exposure). It’s possible that performing several simultaneous or repeated tests could overcome an individual test’s limited sensitivity; however, such strategies need validation.

Finally, thresholds for ruling out infection need to be developed for a variety of clinical situations. Since defining these thresholds is a value judgement, public input will be crucial.","                                              Skip directly to site content  Skip directly to page options  Skip directly to A-Z link     Self-Checker               Coronavirus Self-Checker   ×                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

11,(false negative|false-negative) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/06/how-negative-covid-19-test-can-mislead/613246/,"It’s still unclear how good COVID-19 tests are at finding these presymptomatic cases, but the timing of the test matters. As soon as the coronavirus finds its way into a new host, it hijacks cells to copy itself. The amount of virus builds over this time, peaking at or right before symptom onset, which can take two to 14 days but usually takes an average of five or six. Accordingly, public-health authorities have advised getting tested about four days after exposure.

This is a reasonable recommendation, given the knowns, but surprisingly little data exists on how early COVID-19 tests can detect infection before symptom onset. One model using COVID-19 cases from seven previously published studies suggests that the false-negative rate is 100 percent on day one of exposure, which falls to 38 percent on day five (when symptoms on average appear) and then a minimum of 20 percent on day eight. But in combing the literature, the researchers behind this model found only one case where a patient was tested before feeling sick—as part of a cluster at a chalet in the French Alps. Moreover, the model doesn’t address a whole other set of people who never develop symptoms at all. “It gave no information about people who are permanently asymptomatic,” Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who co-authored that study, told me.

More data are likely to come soon. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration released recommendations for labs and manufacturers that want to validate COVID-19 tests in people who don’t have symptoms. (Currently, no tests are FDA-authorized for screening asymptomatic people.) Testing large numbers of asymptomatic people—such as by pooling samples—to identify potential silent carriers will also be an essential part of the reopening strategy for schools and businesses.

For individuals, however, the FDA cautions that negative results do not rule out infection. It asks that asymptomatic tests include this statement: “Negative results must be considered in the context of an individual’s recent exposures, history, presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.” And this, in the face of imperfect COVID-19 tests, is key to interpreting a negative result. It depends on your probability of having COVID-19 in the first place.

Consider again the decision to visit elderly relatives after a negative test. “If you have symptoms or you work in a place where you’re at high risk for exposure, then even with a negative test, you might want to think really hard about it,” Steven Woloshin, a co-director of the Center for Medicine and Media at the Dartmouth Institute, explained to me. “If you’re at low risk because you live in some remote area, you’re practicing social distancing, you always wear a mask, and you feel fine,” a negative test is probably a true negative. So even with widespread testing, social distancing and masks will continue to be important for controlling the spread of COVID-19.","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe      Science   What a Negative COVID-19 Test Really Means   We know very little about how reliable tests are for people who don’t feel sick.  Sarah Zhang   June 21, 2020     Paul Spella / The Atlantic     Link Copied    You go out to a bar with friends this week, and you’re planning to visit your elderly relatives in a few days. You feel healthy, and you even get a COVID-19 test out of caution. The result comes back negative. Is it safe to go? Not exactly, experts say. How well COVID-19 tests work in people who feel healthy is still a key unknown of the pandemic. The test may overlook the small but growing amounts of virus in someone who has not yet developed symptoms, who could still go on to spread COVID-19 without knowing it. So as Americans weigh the risks of attending protests, rallies, birthday parties, dinners, and all of the social gatherings that make up normal life, they will have to contend with the uncertainty that a negative test result does not rule out infection. “If they go do a risky contact, they can’t get a ‘Get out of jail free’ card. They can’t just get tested and feel fine,” A. Marm Kilpatrick , a disease ecologist at UC Santa Cruz, says. Read: America is giving up on the pandemic Understanding false negatives from COVID-19 tests is especially important because people who do not yet know that they’re sick play a major role in the spread of COVID-19. A study based on data in and around China suggests that 44 percent of transmission comes from presymptomatic cases. The United States has not isolated people who say they feel sick as aggressively as China has, so it likely has a higher proportion of symptomatic transmission, Benjamin Cowling , an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who co-authored the study, says. But China’s experience makes clear that simply isolating people once they are sick is not enough. “We can’t ignore presymptomatic transmission,” Cowling says. “Even if you manage to stop some of the transmission from going on by doing isolation cases, you still will have this presymptomatic transmission, which keeps the epidemic going.”        It’s still unclear how good COVID-19 tests are at finding these presymptomatic cases, but the timing of the test matters. As soon as the coronavirus finds its way into a new host, it hijacks cells to copy itself. The amount of virus builds over this time, peaking at or right before symptom onset , which can take two to 14 days but usually takes an average of five or six. Accordingly, public-health authorities have advised getting tested about four days after exposure.

The head of the Test and Trace programme has been challenged over the risks of false negative coronavirus results by a committee of MPs.

Dido Harding was asked at the health select committee why people are not repeatedly tested to ensure they do not have coronavirus.

MPs heard 20% of positive cases may be missed by the test.

Earlier Boris Johnson told the Commons tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June.

Questioned by Mr Hunt, the PM said the 24-hour target would need to take into account ""insuperable problems"" such as postal delays.

He said ""I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that.""

The tests involve a nose and throat swab which is then used to look for the virus's genetic material. It detects active coronavirus infection, so cannot say if someone has recovered from Covid-19.

Testing positive should allow contacts to be traced, and determine whether NHS staff can go back to work.

But the swab tests carried out can deliver false negative results - suggesting someone does not have coronavirus when they are actually positive.

That could be because of the quality of the swab, the timing of the test or issues in the lab.

During the select committee hearing Mr Hunt cited evidence from the University of Bristol as suggesting 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected.

Baroness Harding said she understood estimates of the proportion of false negative results ranged between ""two and 20-odd per cent"".

She added that the issue of why those with a negative result were not re-tested was ""a medical"" question for the scientists, and it was her job ""to take Sage and chief medical officers' guidance"".

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The test is reliable and effective. Like any diagnostic test however, there is always the small possibility of a false negative or a false positive result.""

'Best guess'

The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, had earlier called for NHS staff to be tested more than once.

Dr Claudia Paoloni, the union's president, said relying on a single negative result risked ""infecting patients and staff"".

Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said people needed to be aware that one test wasn't ""good enough"".

It's necessary to have multiple tests, she said, and they needed to be separated by 72 hours.

Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered.

GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson told BBC Radio 4's More or Less programme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme.

Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality.

For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else.

People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked.

And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out.

The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old.

It deserves to be given a little time to bed in.

But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate.

This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented.

It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals.

If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail.

Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said.

Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week.
