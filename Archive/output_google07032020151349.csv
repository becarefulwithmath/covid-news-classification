Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs

Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.

Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic.[80]

Finance of business

Business finance measures include:[81]

Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.

Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]

Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.

Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe, PPK)

Healthcare

Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.

Enhancing financial market soundness

Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee.[83]

Public investment plan

Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.

The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

[83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation, [21] [22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power. [21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German . [2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements , palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"". [24]   Wineries [ edit ]  The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia ). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż ( Paradise ) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s). Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.   Panorama of the city from the vineyards  Climate [ edit ] The climate is oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) with some humid continental characteristics ( Dfb ) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

An animated map of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs

Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.

Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic.[80]

Finance of business

Business finance measures include:[81]

Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.

Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]

Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.

Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe, PPK)

Healthcare

Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.

Enhancing financial market soundness

Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee.[83]

Public investment plan

Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.

The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia , which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz) , Rybnik (Rybnik) , Pszczyna (Pleß) , Wodzisław (Loslau) , Żory (Sohrau) , Mikołów (Nikolai) , Tychy (Tichau) , Królewska Huta (Königshütte) , Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz) , Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg) , Woźniki (Woischnik) , Lubliniec (Lublinitz) , Cieszyn (Teschen) , Skoczów (Skotschau) , Bielsko (Bielitz) ). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship  Żywiec (Saybusch) , Wilamowice (Wilmesau) , Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno ), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin) , Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa) , Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) , Częstochowa (Tschenstochau) , Myszków , Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin) , Zawiercie , Sławków ) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship . After aggression of Nazi Germany ( Invasion of Poland ), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province ( Gau Schlesien ) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław) . It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz. The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government ( Generalgouvernement ), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG. In 1941 the Silesian Province  ( Provinz Schlesien ) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created ( Provinz Oberschlesien ):  Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.  Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.  After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship. The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:  Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Geography [ edit ]  The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region ( Czech Republic ), Žilina Region ( Slovakia ) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east). The region includes the Silesian Upland ( Wyżyna Śląska ) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland ( Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska ) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains ( Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki ). The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole , the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship . On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa , Zawiercie , Myszków , Jaworzno , Sosnowiec , Żywiec , Dąbrowa Górnicza , Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała , which are historically parts of Lesser Poland ).  Demography [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation, [21] [22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power. [21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

Concert Hall

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German . [2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements , palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"". [24]   Wineries [ edit ]  The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia ). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż ( Paradise ) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s). Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.   Panorama of the city from the vineyards  Climate [ edit ] The climate is oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) with some humid continental characteristics ( Dfb ) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

An animated map of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs

Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.

Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic.[80]

Finance of business

Business finance measures include:[81]

Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.

Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]

Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.

Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe, PPK)

Healthcare

Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.

Enhancing financial market soundness

Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee.[83]

Public investment plan

Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.

The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia , which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz) , Rybnik (Rybnik) , Pszczyna (Pleß) , Wodzisław (Loslau) , Żory (Sohrau) , Mikołów (Nikolai) , Tychy (Tichau) , Królewska Huta (Königshütte) , Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz) , Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg) , Woźniki (Woischnik) , Lubliniec (Lublinitz) , Cieszyn (Teschen) , Skoczów (Skotschau) , Bielsko (Bielitz) ). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship  Żywiec (Saybusch) , Wilamowice (Wilmesau) , Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno ), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin) , Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa) , Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) , Częstochowa (Tschenstochau) , Myszków , Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin) , Zawiercie , Sławków ) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship . After aggression of Nazi Germany ( Invasion of Poland ), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province ( Gau Schlesien ) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław) . It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz. The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government ( Generalgouvernement ), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG. In 1941 the Silesian Province  ( Provinz Schlesien ) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created ( Provinz Oberschlesien ):  Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.  Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.  After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship. The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:  Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Geography [ edit ]  The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region ( Czech Republic ), Žilina Region ( Slovakia ) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east). The region includes the Silesian Upland ( Wyżyna Śląska ) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland ( Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska ) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains ( Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki ). The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole , the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship . On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa , Zawiercie , Myszków , Jaworzno , Sosnowiec , Żywiec , Dąbrowa Górnicza , Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała , which are historically parts of Lesser Poland ).  Demography [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation, [21] [22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power. [21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

Concert Hall

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German . [2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements , palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"". [24]   Wineries [ edit ]  The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia ). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż ( Paradise ) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s). Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.   Panorama of the city from the vineyards  Climate [ edit ] The climate is oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) with some humid continental characteristics ( Dfb ) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

4,4 (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus/temporary-limitations,"1. MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS

Important! 2 meters – minimum distance between pedestrians

We introduce an obligation to maintain at least a 2-meter distance between pedestrians.

Excluded from this requirement are:

parents with children requiring care (up to 13 years of age),

people living together or forming a joint household,

as well as people with disabilities, those who cannot move on their own, people with special education needs statement and their caregivers,

people who cover their mouth and nose.

Valid until: further notice.

2. COVERING MOUTH AND NOSE IN PUBLIC SPACES

The obligation entails: wearing masks or any other kind of garment covering the mouth and nose in situations, where it is impossible to keep a 2-metre distance from others.

How does it work? Covering your mouth and nose is obligatory in open spaces, when you cannot keep the distance of 2 metres away from others, as well as in a closed space – e.g. in shops or public transport.

Masks remain obligatory:

in buses, trams and trains;

in passenger cars, when riding with somebody you don’t live with on a daily basis;

in a store, bank, market and post office;

in the cinema and theatre;

at the doctor’s office, clinic, hospital, massage and tattoo parlours;

in church, at school, at the university;

in public buildings, including offices, in particular while handling official matters;

Exceptions. Where don't you have to cover your mouth and nose?

in a restaurant or bar – when you take your place at the table and eat or drink

at work – if you do not have contact with outsiders (e.g. when serving clients and applicants)

in the forest

when eating meals or drinks after taking a seat on a train subject to mandatory seat reservation, including meals and drinks issued on board the train (WARS restaurant wagon)

Remains in force: indefinitely, until further notice.

3. PUBLIC TRANSIT

Restriction concerns: the use of public transit.

How does it work? Public transit authorities are now allowed to increase the passenger limit in public transit vehicles. How many people can use a vehicle?

As many people as there are seats (if there are only seats)

or

as many as 50% of the total number of seats and standing spots (in this case, however, half the seats must remain empty).

Example

If there are seats on the bus, they can all be occupied. If the bus has 30 seats and 70 standing spots, it can accommodate 50 people.

Remains in force: indefinitely, until further notice.

4. AIR TRAFFIC

The restriction applies to: international flights.

What is it about? The prohibition on flights does not apply to aircraft taking off from airports located in:

member states of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) – parties to the agreement on the European Economic Area,

Switzerland or an EU Member State (except Sweden and Portugal).

Applicable: from 30 July 2020.

Domestic air traffic

Domestic passenger traffic has been resumed.

Applicable: from 1 June 2020.

Important note! From July 1, passengers in planes will be able to take all seats.

5. INTERNATIONAL RAIL TRAFFIC

International rail traffic has been restored within the internal borders of the European Union.

Applicable: from 22 June 2020.

The restriction applies to: traveling by international trains to destinations outside the EU's external borders.

Valid until further notice.

6. ASSEMBLIES AND EVENTS - RESTRICTIONS

Restriction concerns: organisation of gatherings, meetings, events or assemblies.

How does it work? All gatherings and events attended by more than 150 people are forbidden.

4,4 (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus/are-you-going-out-cover-your-mouth-and-nose,"The obligation to cover the mouth and nose in Poland is valid until further notice. It applies to everybody in:

public transport vehicles (buses, trams, subway, etc.),

cars – in cases when strangers, i.e. those who do not live together (e.g. colleagues from work, neighbours, etc.) travel together,

EXAMPLE: I drive a car with my mother, with whom I live on a daily basis. In such a situation, I do not need to cover the mouth and nose.

EXAMPLE: I will drive a friend with whom I do not live on a daily basis. For safety reasons, I am obliged to cover the nose and mouth during such journeys.

on roads and squares (also applies to people riding a vehicle, e.g. a bicycle or scooter),

in workplaces (applies to people who have contact with outsiders – customers, clients, citizens, etc.),

EXAMPLE: I cannot work remotely, but I do all the tasks at work in my room. At work, I have no contact with people from the outside. In such a situation, I do not have to cover the mouth and nose.

EXAMPLE: I work at the reception and my duty is to receive documents from couriers and clients. I have contact with outsiders. In such a situation, I have to cover the mouth and nose.

You do not have to cover your mouth and nose at work unless you serve external clients.

in public buildings (e.g. offices, schools, universities, clinics and hospitals, at the post office, in banks and restaurants),

in shops and marketplaces,

at service outlets,

in staircases, elevators, laundries and other common areas used by residents in an apartment building.

Important note! Police officers, border guards, cashiers at the bank, or shopkeepers can ask us to uncover our face for the purpose of identification. We are then obliged to obey their request.

Important note! Employees of stores and service outlets can cover their faces with a visor if all cash registers, sales outlets, windows, cash desks, etc. are separated from customers by an additional protective cover.

Small children, sick people and farmers. Who else is not required to cover the mouth and nose?

As a rule, everyone has to cover their mouth and nose. However, there are some exceptions. These include:

children up to 4 years old,

people with breathing problems (no certificate is required),

people who cannot put on or take off their face covering by themselves because of their state of health (no certificate is required),

people travelling by car – if the passengers live together,

people travelling by car – if only the driver or a driver with a child up to 4 years old is in the vehicle,

employees in workplaces, public buildings and commercial facilities. IMPORTANT NOTE! However, people who directly serve clients or customers in these places are required to cover their mouth and nose!

public transport drivers and private carriers – provided that they are separated from passengers by a screen,

clergy celebrating religious rituals,

farmers working on the farm,

soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland and allied forces, as well as officers of the Military Counterintelligence Service and the Military Intelligence Service, performing official tasks.

How can you protect yourself? Not only with a mask!

We can cover the mouth and nose with a shawl, a scarf, a neckerchief or other piece of clothing. There is no obligation to use only face masks.

However, if you decide on face masks, it is worth knowing which ones to use. What should you pay attention to?

Masks can be made of several fabrics:

cotton,

cotton with an admixture of elastane,

cotton with linen,

linen,

polyester,

viscose with an admixture of polyester,

polyamide with polyester,

interlinings.

The mask should tightly cover the face, but remain comfortable to wear and allow breathing. Reusable masks should be washed after each use.

How do I make a mask?

You can quickly and easily make a mask by yourself – use the sample pattern that can be found at the bottom of the page. All you need is a piece of material (the list of fabrics from which the mask can be made is given above) and two elastic bands. If you use light material, multiply the number of layers of the fabric.

The mask should be tied at the back with straps or have elastic bands that can be put behind the ears.

In the middle part it should contain pleats (accordion) that will allow it to match the shape of the face (and thus cover the nose, mouth and chin).

The upper edge should be reinforced to allow a tight fit of the mask to the nose.

The “flat” size should be at least 17.5 cm x 9.5 cm.

4,4 (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus/guidelines-for-the-operation-of-gastronomy-during-the-sars-cov-2-epidemic-in-poland,"If you manage a catering facility, check how to ensure the safety of employees and clients. Following the guidelines, we have developed together with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, remember:

To provide employees with gloves or hand sanitizers. To ensure adequate distance between clients – if necessary, take some tables out of use. To disinfect tables and common areas. To pay special attention to strict hygiene rules.

Below you will find detailed instructions.

Guidelines for the operation of gastronomy during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Poland. Ministry of Development and Chief Sanitary Inspectorate

Purpose of the implemented procedures:

Increase additionally the safety of employees and clients of restaurants, cafes, food courts and other premises where catering services are provided. Minimise the risk of infecting clients and other people from outside, including suppliers. Limit the number of contacts in the restaurant within a given period of time, as a mean of protection against possible infection. Act in a complex way, adapted to the stage of advancement of the state of epidemic.

The guidelines are divided into four parts:

Ensuring employee safety. Ensuring client safety. Preventive procedures: suspected coronavirus infection among employees. Procedures in the event of a suspected coronavirus infection regarding client.

Ensuring employee safety The employer is obliged to provide employees, regardless the basis of employment, with disposable gloves or hand sanitizers. In the case of waiters and other staff (e.g. cashiers), it is recommended to wear masks, as well as wear gloves or disinfect hands after each service. It is recommended: to ensure a distance of 1.5 m between workstations, unless this is impossible due to the nature of the facility. But then the employer must provide personal protection equipment,

to identify tasks and processes that typically require close interaction and determine ways to modify them so as to increase physical distances between employees where it is practical and safe. It is advisable to arrange the stations in such a way that the employees are as much distanced as possible from one another, and, if possible, do not work closely in front of one another,

to establish permanent shifts with the least possible number of employees,

to limit the interaction of personnel working on various shifts and to ensure cleaning and washing of rooms between shifts,

to use, where possible, remote methods for communication, such as a mobile phone or radio,

to reduce the number of employees using common areas at a given time (e.g. by spreading meal breaks and work starting times),

to strictly comply with hygiene rules, good hygiene practices,

to maintain a high level of personal hygiene, including taking care of adequate, clean and – if necessary – protective clothing,

to permanently apply good hygiene practices (regular hand washing, refraining from unsanitary behaviour, for example sneezing or coughing, during preparation or contact with food, special care for cleanliness of toilets, etc.). Care should be taken to remind employees of the principles of personal hygiene, hand washing and disinfection, and the obligation to inform about poor health. This applies not only to employees having direct contact with the facility and food, but also to office employees, drivers, suppliers, service technicians etc.

Ensuring client safety Particular attention should be paid to: Discipline of maintaining a 2-metre distance between people standing in a queue by using visible directions (e.g. floor stickers or standing signs).

Mandatory hand disinfection by clients at the entrance to the premises.

Providing dispensers with liquid hand disinfectants for guests in the dining room area (at the ordering / checkout points) and at the exit from toilets.

Exclusion from the use of blower dryers, use of hand wiping paper in bathrooms.

Designation of zones on the floor to ensure that appropriate distances are maintained between guests (the distance does not apply to families or persons remaining in the same household), taking into account outdoor gardens.

The distance between table tops (measured from their edges) should be min. 2 m, and 1 m if the tables are separated by partitions with a minimum height of 1 m (above the table top).

The principle that a family or persons staying in a shared household may stay at one table. In other cases, there should be one person per table, unless the distance between such persons is at least 1.5 m and they are not sitting opposite each other. The exceptions are tables in which partitions, e.g. made of plexiglass, are mounted between persons.

Compliance with the assumption that no more than 1 person per 4m 2 may stay in the premise.

Clear, hardly removable marking of excluded tables and preparation of a hall plan for the time of the epidemic.

Determining and controlling the maximum number of guests in the restaurant – based on the number of seats available, taking into account the principles contained above (excluding those put out of use).

Placing information about the maximum number of guests at the entrance to the facility.

Designation of secure outdoor areas for guests awaiting entry. Having guests sit at a specific free table. Covering mouth and nose and wearing gloves is not required for guests of the catering facility, when they are already sitting and when they are eating. It is required to disinfect the table each time after serving the guests of the catering facility at the given table. After disinfection, the table should be marked with the notice “disinfected”. Disinfect common areas that clients come into contact with (excluding the floor) at least every 15 minutes. It is recommended to ensure, where possible, constant ventilation of restaurant premises. It is recommended to hang on the toilet instructions regarding: hand washing

hand disinfection

removing and putting on gloves

removing and putting on the mask. Self-service spaces, including salad bars, buffets, and dispensers for self-dispensing beverages should be put out of use. On-site service: bringing ordered meals on trays,

washing and disinfecting trays after each use. Take-away service: serving orders on the counter, in bags,

contactless serving of orders,

Ensuring safety when using screens for placing orders (“kiosks”) through e.g. a dispenser with liquid for disinfecting hands or disposable gloves and regular (several times a day), wiping the surface of the screens. Removal of additions (e.g. sugar, disposable cutlery, vases, napkins) from the dining room area and having them brought directly by the service with the ordered meals.

Preventive procedures: suspected coronavirus infection among employees Employees / persons providing services in the facility should be instructed that in the event of disturbing symptoms they should not come to work, they should stay at home and call the sanitary-epidemiological station, infectious department and in case of deterioration of health, they should call 999 or 112 and let you know they may be infected with coronavirus. It is recommended to follow the information published by the Chief Sanitary Inspector and the Minister of Health, available at gis.gov.pl or https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/, as well as applicable law. In the event of disturbing symptoms suggesting coronavirus infection regarding an employee performing their tasks in the workplace, such employee should be immediately dismissed

from work and sent back home (by their own means of transport or sanitary transport) or, if this is impossible, the employee should wait for transport in a designated room, in which temporary isolation from other people is possible. In the event that it is not possible to dedicate a room to a person suspected of being infected, a place should be separated in which the person will safely wait for transport at a distance of at least 2 from other people. It is necessary to suspend the reception of clients, notify the local poviat sanitary and epidemiological station and strictly follow the orders and instructions given. It is recommended to determine the area in which the employee has been moving and staying, carry out routine cleaning in accordance with the salon's procedures, and disinfect the touched surfaces (door handles, handrails, handles, etc.). It is recommended to follow the recommendations of the state poviat sanitary inspector when determining whether additional procedures should be implemented in the given case.","      Skip to content  Go to the Footer section    In order to ensure the highest quality of our services, we use small files called cookies.

Following the guidelines, we have developed together with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, remember:   To provide employees with gloves or hand sanitizers.  To ensure adequate distance between clients – if necessary, take some tables out of use.  To disinfect tables and common areas.  To pay special attention to strict hygiene rules.   Below you will find detailed instructions.    Guidelines for the operation of gastronomy during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Poland. Ministry of Development and Chief Sanitary Inspectorate  Purpose of the implemented procedures:   Increase additionally the safety of employees and clients of restaurants, cafes, food courts and other premises where catering services are provided.  Minimise the risk of infecting clients and other people from outside, including suppliers.  Limit the number of contacts in the restaurant within a given period of time, as a mean of protection against possible infection.  Act in a complex way, adapted to the stage of advancement of the state of epidemic.     The guidelines are divided into four parts:   Ensuring employee safety.  Ensuring client safety.  Preventive procedures: suspected coronavirus infection among employees.  Procedures in the event of a suspected coronavirus infection regarding client.     Ensuring employee safety   The employer is obliged to provide employees, regardless the basis of employment, with disposable gloves or hand sanitizers.  In the case of waiters and other staff (e.g. cashiers), it is recommended to wear masks, as well as wear gloves or disinfect hands after each service.  It is recommended:    to ensure a distance of 1.5 m between workstations, unless this is impossible due to the nature of the facility. But then the employer must provide personal protection equipment,  to identify tasks and processes that typically require close interaction and determine ways to modify them so as to increase physical distances between employees where it is practical and safe. It is advisable to arrange the stations in such a way that the employees are as much distanced as possible from one another, and, if possible, do not work closely in front of one another,  to establish permanent shifts with the least possible number of employees,  to limit the interaction of personnel working on various shifts and to ensure cleaning and washing of rooms between shifts,  to use, where possible, remote methods for communication, such as a mobile phone or radio,  to reduce the number of employees using common areas at a given time (e.g. by spreading meal breaks and work starting times),  to strictly comply with hygiene rules, good hygiene practices,  to maintain a high level of personal hygiene, including taking care of adequate, clean and – if necessary – protective clothing,  to permanently apply good hygiene practices (regular hand washing, refraining from unsanitary behaviour, for example sneezing or coughing, during preparation or contact with food, special care for cleanliness of toilets, etc.).    Care should be taken to remind employees of the principles of personal hygiene, hand washing and disinfection, and the obligation to inform about poor health. This applies not only to employees having direct contact with the facility and food, but also to office employees, drivers, suppliers, service technicians etc.    Ensuring client safety   Particular attention should be paid to:    Discipline of maintaining a 2-metre distance between people standing in a queue by using visible directions (e.g. floor stickers or standing signs).  Mandatory hand disinfection by clients at the entrance to the premises.  Providing dispensers with liquid hand disinfectants for guests in the dining room area (at the ordering / checkout points) and at the exit from toilets.  Exclusion from the use of blower dryers, use of hand wiping paper in bathrooms.  Designation of zones on the floor to ensure that appropriate distances are maintained between guests (the distance does not apply to families or persons remaining in the same household), taking into account outdoor gardens.  The distance between table tops (measured from their edges) should be min. 2 m, and 1 m if the tables are separated by partitions with a minimum height of 1 m (above the table top).  The principle that a family or persons staying in a shared household may stay at one table. In other cases, there should be one person per table, unless the distance between such persons is at least 1.5 m and they are not sitting opposite each other. The exceptions are tables in which partitions, e.g. made of plexiglass, are mounted between persons.  Compliance with the assumption that no more than 1 person per 4m 2 may stay in the premise.  Clear, hardly removable marking of excluded tables and preparation of a hall plan for the time of the epidemic.  Determining and controlling the maximum number of guests in the restaurant – based on the number of seats available, taking into account the principles contained above (excluding those put out of use).  Placing information about the maximum number of guests at the entrance to the facility.  Designation of secure outdoor areas for guests awaiting entry. Having guests sit at a specific free table.    Covering mouth and nose and wearing gloves is not required for guests of the catering facility, when they are already sitting and when they are eating.  It is required to disinfect the table each time after serving the guests of the catering facility at the given table. After disinfection, the table should be marked with the notice “disinfected”.  Disinfect common areas that clients come into contact with (excluding the floor) at least every 15 minutes.  It is recommended to ensure, where possible, constant ventilation of restaurant premises.  It is recommended to hang on the toilet instructions regarding:   hand washing  hand disinfection  removing and putting on gloves  removing and putting on the mask.    Self-service spaces, including salad bars, buffets, and dispensers for self-dispensing beverages should be put out of use.  On-site service:   bringing ordered meals on trays,  washing and disinfecting trays after each use.    Take-away service:   serving orders on the counter, in bags,  contactless serving of orders,  Ensuring safety when using screens for placing orders (“kiosks”) through e.g. a dispenser with liquid for disinfecting hands or disposable gloves and regular (several times a day), wiping the surface of the screens.    Removal of additions (e.g. sugar, disposable cutlery, vases, napkins) from the dining room area and having them brought directly by the service with the ordered meals.    Preventive procedures: suspected coronavirus infection among employees   Employees / persons providing services in the facility should be instructed that in the event of disturbing symptoms they should not come to work, they should stay at home and call the sanitary-epidemiological station, infectious department and in case of deterioration of health, they should call 999 or 112 and let you know they may be infected with coronavirus.  It is recommended to follow the information published by the Chief Sanitary Inspector and the Minister of Health, available at gis.gov.pl or https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/, as well as applicable law.  In the event of disturbing symptoms suggesting coronavirus infection regarding an employee performing their tasks in the workplace, such employee should be immediately dismissed from work and sent back home (by their own means of transport or sanitary transport) or, if this is impossible, the employee should wait for transport in a designated room, in which temporary isolation from other people is possible.  In the event that it is not possible to dedicate a room to a person suspected of being infected, a place should be separated in which the person will safely wait for transport at a distance of at least 2 from other people.  It is necessary to suspend the reception of clients, notify the local poviat sanitary and epidemiological station and strictly follow the orders and instructions given.  It is recommended to determine the area in which the employee has been moving and staying, carry out routine cleaning in accordance with the salon's procedures, and disinfect the touched surfaces (door handles, handrails, handles, etc.).  It is recommended to follow the recommendations of the state poviat sanitary inspector when determining whether additional procedures should be implemented in the given case.    Procedures in the event of a suspected coronavirus infection regarding guest / client.   If there are clear signs of illness, such as persistent cough, malaise, difficulty in breathing, a person should not be allowed to enter the facility. They should be instructed to report to the nearest infectious ward as soon as possible in order to consult a doctor - going there by their own mean of transport or notifying 999 or 112.  Reporting the incident to the facility management so to enable staff to determine the area in which the person was moving and staying, conduct routine cleaning in accordance with the facility's procedures, and disinfect the touched surfaces (door handles, handrails, handles, etc.).  Establishing a list of employees and clients present at the same time in part / parts of the facility in which such person stayed and recommending them to follow the guidelines of the Chief Sanitary Inspector available on gov.pl/web/koronawirus/ and gis.gov.pl referring to people who have had contact with an infected person.

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region. There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Ukrainian Settlement Permits and Temporary Residence Permits since Poland's EU accession [9] Permits / Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Permanent Settlement Permits 1,905 1,654 1,438 1,609 1,685 1,280 9,571 Temporary Residence Permits 8,518 8,304 7,733 7,381 8,307 8,489 48,736 Grand total 58,303 Source: EU Membership Highlights Poland's Migration Challenges, Warsaw

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[7]   History, and trends [ edit ]  Main article: History of the Ukrainian minority in Poland  Since World War II [ edit ]  After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union , about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula , settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943. The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002 . Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831). [7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.

After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union , in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table). [9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership , Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009. [10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days. [11]  After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland. [12]  The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015. [13]  In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland , Andrii Deshchytsia , noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good. [14]  According to the NBP , 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

Concert Hall

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs

Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.

Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic.[80]

Finance of business

Business finance measures include:[81]

Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.

Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]

Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.

Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe, PPK)

Healthcare

Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.

Enhancing financial market soundness

Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee.[83]

Public investment plan

Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.

The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region. There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.  Politics [ edit ]   Silesian Regional Assembly  Main article: Silesian Regional Assembly  The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister . The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly).

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Ukrainian Settlement Permits and Temporary Residence Permits since Poland's EU accession [9] Permits / Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Permanent Settlement Permits 1,905 1,654 1,438 1,609 1,685 1,280 9,571 Temporary Residence Permits 8,518 8,304 7,733 7,381 8,307 8,489 48,736 Grand total 58,303 Source: EU Membership Highlights Poland's Migration Challenges, Warsaw

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[7]   History, and trends [ edit ]  Main article: History of the Ukrainian minority in Poland  Since World War II [ edit ]  After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union , about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula , settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943. The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002 . Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831). [7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.

After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union , in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table). [9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership , Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009. [10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days. [11]  After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland. [12]  The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015. [13]  In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland , Andrii Deshchytsia , noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good. [14]  According to the NBP , 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016. [15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013). [5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months. [16]  The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period. [4]  About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka , [17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018. [18]   Refugees [ edit ]  Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine , including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""), [19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

Concert Hall

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

4–9 March: imported cases only [ edit ]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative DE CZ SK BY Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU UA ): shades of blue.

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa , Zawiercie , Myszków , Jaworzno , Sosnowiec , Żywiec , Dąbrowa Górnicza , Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała , which are historically parts of Lesser Poland ).  Demography [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.  Tourism [ edit ]   Pless Castle in Pszczyna  Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt . Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk , Brenna , Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska . The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna 's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery ( Rudy Raciborskie , Wodzisław Śląski ). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming. With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region. There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.  Politics [ edit ]   Silesian Regional Assembly  Main article: Silesian Regional Assembly  The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister . The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly).

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002 . Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English .

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated .

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia , which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz) , Rybnik (Rybnik) , Pszczyna (Pleß) , Wodzisław (Loslau) , Żory (Sohrau) , Mikołów (Nikolai) , Tychy (Tichau) , Królewska Huta (Königshütte) , Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz) , Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg) , Woźniki (Woischnik) , Lubliniec (Lublinitz) , Cieszyn (Teschen) , Skoczów (Skotschau) , Bielsko (Bielitz) ). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship  Żywiec (Saybusch) , Wilamowice (Wilmesau) , Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno ), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin) , Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa) , Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) , Częstochowa (Tschenstochau) , Myszków , Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin) , Zawiercie , Sławków ) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship . After aggression of Nazi Germany ( Invasion of Poland ), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province ( Gau Schlesien ) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław) . It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz. The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government ( Generalgouvernement ), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG. In 1941 the Silesian Province  ( Provinz Schlesien ) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created ( Provinz Oberschlesien ):  Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.  Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.  After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship. The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:  Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Geography [ edit ]  The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region ( Czech Republic ), Žilina Region ( Slovakia ) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east). The region includes the Silesian Upland ( Wyżyna Śląska ) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland ( Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska ) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains ( Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki ). The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole , the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship . On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa , Zawiercie , Myszków , Jaworzno , Sosnowiec , Żywiec , Dąbrowa Górnicza , Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała , which are historically parts of Lesser Poland ).  Demography [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.  Tourism [ edit ]   Pless Castle in Pszczyna  Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt . Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk , Brenna , Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska . The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna 's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery ( Rudy Raciborskie , Wodzisław Śląski ). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming. With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.  Cities and towns [ edit ]   Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship   Jasna Góra in Częstochowa is the holiest Roman Catholic shrine in Poland   Gliwice , one of the oldest cities in Silesia   Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub  Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat ). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019): [1]    Katowice (293,636)  Częstochowa (221,252)  Sosnowiec (201,121)  Gliwice (179,154)  Zabrze (172,806)  Bielsko-Biała (170,953)  Bytom (165,975)  Rybnik (138,319)  Ruda Śląska (137,624)  Tychy (127,664)  Dąbrowa Górnicza (119,800)  Chorzów (107,963)  Jaworzno (91,263)  Jastrzębie-Zdrój (88,808)  Mysłowice (74,515)  Siemianowice Śląskie (66,963)  Żory (62,462)  Tarnowskie Góry (61,422)  Będzin (56,624)  Piekary Śląskie (55,088)  Racibórz (54,778)  Świętochłowice (49,762)  Zawiercie (49,334)  Wodzisław Śląski (47,992)  Mikołów (40,898)  Knurów (38,310)  Czechowice-Dziedzice (35,926)  Cieszyn (34,513)  Myszków (31,650)  Czeladź (31,545)  Żywiec (31,194)  Czerwionka-Leszczyny (28,156)  Pszczyna (26,804)  Lubliniec (23,784)  Łaziska Górne (22,298)  Rydułtowy (21,616)  Orzesze (21,043)  Bieruń (19,539)  Pyskowice (18,432)  Radlin (17,776)  Radzionków (16,826)  Lędziny (16,776)  Ustroń (16,073)  Skoczów (14,385)  Pszów (13,896)  Kłobuck (12,934)  Wisła (11,132)  Blachownia (9,545)  Imielin (9,175)  Wojkowice (8,927)  Kalety (8,607)  Poręba (8,525)  Miasteczko Śląskie (7,437)  Sławków (7,017)  Łazy (6,811)  Koniecpol (5,910)  Szczyrk (5,734)  Siewierz (5,581)  Kuźnia Raciborska (5,359)  Żarki (4,556)  Krzepice (4,456)  Woźniki (4,305)  Ogrodzieniec (4,282)  Strumień (3,718)  Szczekociny (3,612)  Toszek (3,600)  Wilamowice (3,100)  Koziegłowy (2,245)  Krzanowice (2,157)  Pilica (1,936)  Sośnicowice (1,919)   Economy [ edit ]  The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region. There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.  Politics [ edit ]   Silesian Regional Assembly  Main article: Silesian Regional Assembly  The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister . The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa. The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.  2018 election [ edit ]      Political groups [10]   Mandates     Prawo i Sprawiedliwość   22     Koalicja Obywatelska   20     SLD Lewica Razem   2     Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe   1     Total  45  Administrative division [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties ( powiats ). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas .

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Ukrainian Settlement Permits and Temporary Residence Permits since Poland's EU accession [9] Permits / Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Permanent Settlement Permits 1,905 1,654 1,438 1,609 1,685 1,280 9,571 Temporary Residence Permits 8,518 8,304 7,733 7,381 8,307 8,489 48,736 Grand total 58,303 Source: EU Membership Highlights Poland's Migration Challenges, Warsaw

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

Concert Hall

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German . [2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements , palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"". [24]   Wineries [ edit ]  The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia ). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż ( Paradise ) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s). Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.   Panorama of the city from the vineyards  Climate [ edit ] The climate is oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) with some humid continental characteristics ( Dfb ) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

The term "" powiat "" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"". A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship ( Polish  województwo ) or province . A powiat is usually subdivided into gmina s (in English, often referred to as "" communes "" or "" municipalities "").  Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gmina s. They are termed "" city counties "" ( powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu ) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK .  The other type of powiat s are termed ""land counties"" ( powiaty ziemskie ). As of 2018, there were 380 powiat -level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see "" List of Polish counties "". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship ).  Contents   1  History  2  Functioning  3  Names and English equivalents  4  Sources  5  External links  6  See also    History [ edit ]  The history of Polish powiat s goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth , until the latter's partitioning in 1795. In the 19th century, the powiat s continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire ("" Congress Poland "")—the equivalent of the Russian "" uyezd "" and the Ukrainian "" povit ""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań , as the Polish equivalent of the German "" Kreis "". After Poland regained independence in 1918 , the powiat s were again the second-level territorial units. Powiat s were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships , but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.  Functioning [ edit ]  Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council ( rada powiatu ), while local executive power is vested in an executive board ( zarząd powiatu ) headed by the starosta , elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo . However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council ( rada miasta ), the directly elected mayor ( burmistrz or prezydent ), and the city offices ( urząd miasta ). In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County ( powiat poznański ) has its offices in Poznań , although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County. Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:  education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)  healthcare (at county level)  public transport  maintenance of certain designated roads  land surveying  issuing of work permits to foreigners  vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates ).  Names and English equivalents [ edit ]  The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender  adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun ). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat . Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski ( Kutno County ). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case ; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case .) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki ("" Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only ( powiat makowski ). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki , Czarnków-Trzcianka County ), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective ( powiat łódzki wschodni , Łódź East County ), or a mountain range ( powiat tatrzański , Tatra County ). There is more than one way to render such names into English . A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski , and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski . In English this ambiguity either does not occur ( Brzeg County and Brzesko County ) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat ( Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County ).

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia , which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz) , Rybnik (Rybnik) , Pszczyna (Pleß) , Wodzisław (Loslau) , Żory (Sohrau) , Mikołów (Nikolai) , Tychy (Tichau) , Królewska Huta (Königshütte) , Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz) , Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg) , Woźniki (Woischnik) , Lubliniec (Lublinitz) , Cieszyn (Teschen) , Skoczów (Skotschau) , Bielsko (Bielitz) ). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship  Żywiec (Saybusch) , Wilamowice (Wilmesau) , Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno ), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin) , Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa) , Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) , Częstochowa (Tschenstochau) , Myszków , Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin) , Zawiercie , Sławków ) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship . After aggression of Nazi Germany ( Invasion of Poland ), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province ( Gau Schlesien ) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław) . It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz. The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government ( Generalgouvernement ), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG. In 1941 the Silesian Province  ( Provinz Schlesien ) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created ( Provinz Oberschlesien ):  Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.  Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.  After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship. The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:  Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Geography [ edit ]  The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region ( Czech Republic ), Žilina Region ( Slovakia ) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east). The region includes the Silesian Upland ( Wyżyna Śląska ) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland ( Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska ) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains ( Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki ). The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole , the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship . On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa , Zawiercie , Myszków , Jaworzno , Sosnowiec , Żywiec , Dąbrowa Górnicza , Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała , which are historically parts of Lesser Poland ).  Demography [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.  Tourism [ edit ]   Pless Castle in Pszczyna  Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt . Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk , Brenna , Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska . The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna 's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery ( Rudy Raciborskie , Wodzisław Śląski ). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming. With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.  Cities and towns [ edit ]   Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship   Jasna Góra in Częstochowa is the holiest Roman Catholic shrine in Poland   Gliwice , one of the oldest cities in Silesia   Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub  Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat ). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019): [1]    Katowice (293,636)  Częstochowa (221,252)  Sosnowiec (201,121)  Gliwice (179,154)  Zabrze (172,806)  Bielsko-Biała (170,953)  Bytom (165,975)  Rybnik (138,319)  Ruda Śląska (137,624)  Tychy (127,664)  Dąbrowa Górnicza (119,800)  Chorzów (107,963)  Jaworzno (91,263)  Jastrzębie-Zdrój (88,808)  Mysłowice (74,515)  Siemianowice Śląskie (66,963)  Żory (62,462)  Tarnowskie Góry (61,422)  Będzin (56,624)  Piekary Śląskie (55,088)  Racibórz (54,778)  Świętochłowice (49,762)  Zawiercie (49,334)  Wodzisław Śląski (47,992)  Mikołów (40,898)  Knurów (38,310)  Czechowice-Dziedzice (35,926)  Cieszyn (34,513)  Myszków (31,650)  Czeladź (31,545)  Żywiec (31,194)  Czerwionka-Leszczyny (28,156)  Pszczyna (26,804)  Lubliniec (23,784)  Łaziska Górne (22,298)  Rydułtowy (21,616)  Orzesze (21,043)  Bieruń (19,539)  Pyskowice (18,432)  Radlin (17,776)  Radzionków (16,826)  Lędziny (16,776)  Ustroń (16,073)  Skoczów (14,385)  Pszów (13,896)  Kłobuck (12,934)  Wisła (11,132)  Blachownia (9,545)  Imielin (9,175)  Wojkowice (8,927)  Kalety (8,607)  Poręba (8,525)  Miasteczko Śląskie (7,437)  Sławków (7,017)  Łazy (6,811)  Koniecpol (5,910)  Szczyrk (5,734)  Siewierz (5,581)  Kuźnia Raciborska (5,359)  Żarki (4,556)  Krzepice (4,456)  Woźniki (4,305)  Ogrodzieniec (4,282)  Strumień (3,718)  Szczekociny (3,612)  Toszek (3,600)  Wilamowice (3,100)  Koziegłowy (2,245)  Krzanowice (2,157)  Pilica (1,936)  Sośnicowice (1,919)   Economy [ edit ]  The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region. There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.  Politics [ edit ]   Silesian Regional Assembly  Main article: Silesian Regional Assembly  The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister . The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa. The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.  2018 election [ edit ]      Political groups [10]   Mandates     Prawo i Sprawiedliwość   22     Koalicja Obywatelska   20     SLD Lewica Razem   2     Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe   1     Total  45  Administrative division [ edit ]  Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties ( powiats ). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas .

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Ukrainian Settlement Permits and Temporary Residence Permits since Poland's EU accession [9] Permits / Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Permanent Settlement Permits 1,905 1,654 1,438 1,609 1,685 1,280 9,571 Temporary Residence Permits 8,518 8,304 7,733 7,381 8,307 8,489 48,736 Grand total 58,303 Source: EU Membership Highlights Poland's Migration Challenges, Warsaw

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

Concert Hall

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

[13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German . [2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements , palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"". [24]   Wineries [ edit ]  The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia ). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż ( Paradise ) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s). Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.   Panorama of the city from the vineyards  Climate [ edit ] The climate is oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) with some humid continental characteristics ( Dfb ) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).

The term "" powiat "" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"". A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship ( Polish  województwo ) or province . A powiat is usually subdivided into gmina s (in English, often referred to as "" communes "" or "" municipalities "").  Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gmina s. They are termed "" city counties "" ( powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu ) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK .  The other type of powiat s are termed ""land counties"" ( powiaty ziemskie ). As of 2018, there were 380 powiat -level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see "" List of Polish counties "". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship ).  Contents   1  History  2  Functioning  3  Names and English equivalents  4  Sources  5  External links  6  See also    History [ edit ]  The history of Polish powiat s goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth , until the latter's partitioning in 1795. In the 19th century, the powiat s continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire ("" Congress Poland "")—the equivalent of the Russian "" uyezd "" and the Ukrainian "" povit ""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań , as the Polish equivalent of the German "" Kreis "". After Poland regained independence in 1918 , the powiat s were again the second-level territorial units. Powiat s were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships , but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.  Functioning [ edit ]  Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council ( rada powiatu ), while local executive power is vested in an executive board ( zarząd powiatu ) headed by the starosta , elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo . However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council ( rada miasta ), the directly elected mayor ( burmistrz or prezydent ), and the city offices ( urząd miasta ). In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County ( powiat poznański ) has its offices in Poznań , although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County. Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:  education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)  healthcare (at county level)  public transport  maintenance of certain designated roads  land surveying  issuing of work permits to foreigners  vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates ).  Names and English equivalents [ edit ]  The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender  adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun ). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat . Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski ( Kutno County ). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case ; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case .) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki ("" Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only ( powiat makowski ). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki , Czarnków-Trzcianka County ), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective ( powiat łódzki wschodni , Łódź East County ), or a mountain range ( powiat tatrzański , Tatra County ). There is more than one way to render such names into English . A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski , and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski . In English this ambiguity either does not occur ( Brzeg County and Brzesko County ) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat ( Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County ).

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Codes U00 to U49 are placeholder codes. Their existence within the ICD allows system developers to build them into encoder software. They are not intended for local adaptation or interpretation. Until WHO assigns the code to an emerging disease, it should not be used.

In 2019, U07.0 was assigned to ""Vaping-related disorder"".[2] On 31 January 2020, after an emergency WHO meeting, U07.1 was assigned to deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection[3] and in March 2020, U07.2 was assigned to deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.[4][5]

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia , which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz) , Rybnik (Rybnik) , Pszczyna (Pleß) , Wodzisław (Loslau) , Żory (Sohrau) , Mikołów (Nikolai) , Tychy (Tichau) , Królewska Huta (Königshütte) , Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz) , Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg) , Woźniki (Woischnik) , Lubliniec (Lublinitz) , Cieszyn (Teschen) , Skoczów (Skotschau) , Bielsko (Bielitz) ). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship  Żywiec (Saybusch) , Wilamowice (Wilmesau) , Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno ), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin) , Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa) , Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) , Częstochowa (Tschenstochau) , Myszków , Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin) , Zawiercie , Sławków ) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship . After aggression of Nazi Germany ( Invasion of Poland ), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province ( Gau Schlesien ) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław) . It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz. The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government ( Generalgouvernement ), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG. In 1941 the Silesian Province  ( Provinz Schlesien ) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created ( Provinz Oberschlesien ):  Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.  Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.  After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship. The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:  Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats  Geography [ edit ]  The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region ( Czech Republic ), Žilina Region ( Slovakia ) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east). The region includes the Silesian Upland ( Wyżyna Śląska ) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland ( Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska ) in the north-east.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation, [21] [22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power. [21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.

10,10 (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic,"Ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[4][6] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March.[7][8] As of 3 July 2020, more than 10.8 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 521,000 deaths; more than 5.76 million people have recovered.[5]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.[9][14][15] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[16] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[17][18] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[19]

Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[9][20] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.

The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[21] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[22] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[23] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[24][25][26] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.[27][28] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population.[29] Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media.[30] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[31]

Epidemiology

Background

On 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[333][334] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.[335] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.[336][337]

Several early infected had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market;[338] the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin.[339] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[340] pangolin coronaviruses,[341][342] and SARS-CoV.[343] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.[344][345] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.[346]

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[347][348] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[349][350][351] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.[352][353]

The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020[354] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly passed China's.[355]

Cases

Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[356] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.[357] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[358][359] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[360] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[361][362]

On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[363] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[364][365] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[366]

Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[367] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[368] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.[369] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.[370]

Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[371] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[372] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[373]

Deaths

Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[379] As of 3 July 2020, approximately 521,000[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June , about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[380]

The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[381] The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[382] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.[383]

Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without testing, e.g. at home or in nursing homes.[384] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.[385] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[386][387] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.[386] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[388]

Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[389] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[390][391][392] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[393] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[394]

The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.8 percent (521,355 deaths for 10,874,146 cases) as of 3 July 2020.[5] The number varies by region.[395]

Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.[396] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.[397][398] The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[399] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4 percent (0.2 to 1.0 percent) and that 35 percent of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26 percent (as of 20 May).[400][401]

Duration

On 11 March 2020, the WHO said the pandemic could be controlled.[8] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, ""Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be.""[403] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required ""until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)"".[404] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is ""so readily transmissible"", it ""might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year"". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.[405]

Signs and symptoms

The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.[9][407] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.[408] As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent.[409]

Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[410][411][412]

Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.[9] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[15] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.[411]

Cause

Transmission

Virology

Illustration of SARSr‑CoV virion

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[343] All features of the novel SARS‑CoV‑2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[425]

SARS‑CoV‑2 is closely related to SARS‑CoV, and is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[340] SARS‑CoV‑2 genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples[426] and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus.[427]

Diagnosis

Demonstration of a swab for COVID-19 testing

COVID-19 can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.[428][429]

Viral testing

The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[430]

A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.[431] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[432]

On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new ""spit test"" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs, and could enable people to conduct it at home.[433]

Imaging

CT scan of a person with COVID‑19 shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungs.

Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[434] The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[435] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[434] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[429]

Prevention

Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.[436][437] Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[438][439] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.[440]

Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak.[441] The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.[442]

Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.[443] There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.[444]

Hand washing

Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[20] CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[436] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[437][445] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.[446]

Surface cleaning

Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.[447] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[448]

Face masks and respiratory hygiene

Recommendations for wearing cloth masks have been a subject of debate.[450] The WHO originally recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19.[451] China and the United States, among other countries, have encouraged the use of face masks or cloth face coverings more generally by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus by asymptomatic individuals as a precautionary principle.[452][453] Several national and local governments have made wearing masks mandatory.[454]

Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing this type of mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.[451]

In June 2020, the WHO changed its policy on wearing face masks, saying they should be worn in public places to help to prevent the spread of COVID-19.[455]

Social distancing

Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[437][456][457] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[458][459] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[460]

The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.[461] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.[462] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.[457]

Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[463][464]

In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term ""social distancing"" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.[465][466] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.[467][468]

Self-isolation

[469] This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population. Without pandemic containment measures—such as social distancing, vaccination, and use of face masks—pathogens can spread exponentially.This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population.

Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[470][471]

Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.[472][473] The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.[474] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[9][17][475]

Management

Screening, containment and mitigation

flattening the curve) and lessening overall cases and health impact.[476][477] Moreover, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity (raising the line) such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand.[478] Goals of mitigation include delaying and reducing peak burden on healthcare () and lessening overall cases and health impact.Moreover, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity () such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand.

[476][479] Mitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or duration—such as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home orders—can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation.

Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression) and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.[480] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[481] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[404]

Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[476] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[476] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[482]

More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.[483] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.[484]

Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.[404]

Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.[485] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.[486]

Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.[486] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)[486]

On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.[487][488] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.[489] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.[490]

Health care

Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.[491] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.[491][492] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.[493][494][495]

Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.[496][497] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.[498][499][500] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.[501][502]

Treatment

Antiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19[503] None has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials.[503] However, remdesivir may affect the time it takes to recover from the virus.[504] Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19.[505] The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.[505][506]

Taking over-the-counter cold medications,[507] drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.[436] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.[508]

Other trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it.[503][509] On 16 June, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support,[510] though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes.[511] Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint.[512]

History

There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[513] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.[514] There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were ""patient zero"".[514] Starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[515] and at least 266 by 31 December.[516]

According to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[339] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.[517]

On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[518] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[519]

On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January),[520] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[521] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about ""the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause"".[522] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases[333][523][524]—enough to trigger an investigation.[335]

During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[525] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[426] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[526] A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later)[527] and more may have been infected.[528] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its ""pandemic potential"".[349][529] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.[528] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times[clarification needed].[530]

On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[531] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[532] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.[533] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[534] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[535] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[536][537] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[538]

On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being reported,[539] the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[540] As for 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed.[541] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[539][542]

As of 3 July 2020, more than 10.8 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 521,000 people have died and more than 5.76 million have recovered.[543][544]

National responses

A total of 188[5] countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.[545] National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).[546]

By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown,[547] which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.[548][549]

By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.[550] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,[551] around 100 million people in the Philippines,[550] about 59 million people in South Africa,[552] and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.[553][554] On 21 May 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5 million cases were surpassed.[555]

Asia

As of 19 May 2020 , cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.[556][557] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly South Korea,[558] Taiwan,[559] and Vietnam,[560] has allowed them to fare comparatively well.

China

Hubei Province: 114.40 cases per 100,000 1.5–2.5 cases per 100,000 1–1.5 cases per 100,000 0.5–1 cases per 100,000 >0–0.5 cases per 100,000 Confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants by province, as of 13 April, showing Hubei with around 40 times more cases than any other province

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan;[347] one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.[352] Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December, upon which her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[561][562] Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.[561] A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December, confirming 27 cases and suggesting wearing face masks.[524] The WHO was informed on the same day.[333] As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for ""spreading rumours"" about the outbreak.[563] The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission.[564] In a 14 January conference call, Chinese officials said privately that human-to-human transmission was a possibility, and pandemic preparations were needed.[565] In a briefing posted during the night of 14–15 January, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out.[566]

On 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus.[567] That same day, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang issued their first public comments about the virus, telling people in infected areas to practice social distancing and avoid travel.[568][569] During the Chinese New Year travel period, authorities instigated a City of Wuhan lockdown.[570] On 10 February the Chinese government launched a radical campaign described by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi as a ""people's war"" to contain the viral spread.[571] In ""the largest quarantine in human history"",[572] a cordon sanitaire on 23 January stopped travel in and out of Wuhan,[573][574] then extended to fifteen Hubei cities affecting about 57 million people.[575] Private vehicle use was banned in the city.[576] Several Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were also cancelled.[577] Authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, completed in ten days.[578] Leishenshan Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.[579] China also converted other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.[580]

On 26 January, the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.[582] Universities and schools around the country were also closed.[583][584][585] The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities.[586] Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.[587] Travel restrictions were enacted in and outside of Hubei.[587][588] Public transport was modified,[589] and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.[587][590][591] Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.[592] In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs.[593] Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.[594][595]

After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus re-entering China from other countries. For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.[596] At the same time, a strong anti-foreigner sentiment quickly took hold,[597] and foreigners experienced harassment by the general public[598] and forced evictions from apartments and hotels.[599][600]

On 24 March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.[601] The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.[602] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end. Those wishing to enter China must to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.[603][604] The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms.[605]

The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 4 April, coinciding with Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing to avoid a renewed COVID-19 outbreak.[606] On 25 April the last patients were discharged in Wuhan.[607] On 13 May the city of Jilin was put on lockdown, sparking fear of a second wave of infection.[608]

Iran

[609] Disinfection of Tehran Metro trains against coronavirus. Similar measures have also been taken in other countries.

Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS‑CoV‑2 infections on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day.[610][611] Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events,[612] sporting events,[613] Friday prayers,[614] and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.[615] Iran allocated 5 trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus.[616] President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.[617] Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March,[618] although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.[619] Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.[620][621]

Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February.[622][623] More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.[623][624] The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March.[625] On 15 March, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.[626] At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March.[627] By 23 March, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.[628] According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.[629] The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.[630] On 20 April it was reported that Iran had reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country, though there is a fear of the second wave of infection due to this move.[631] After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June, raising fear of a second wave.[632]

South Korea

COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February,[633] largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.[633][634] Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.[635][636] By 22 February , among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.[637]

South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.[638] On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported,[639] rising to 3,150 on 29 February.[640] All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.[635] Airline schedules were also changed.[641][642]

A banner in Seoul displays coronavirus infection prevention tips.

South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.[558][643] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,[644] drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,[645] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.[646] South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.[558][647][648]

South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis, many signing petitions either praising it or calling for impeachment.[649] On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.[646] On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.[650] Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.[651] On 15 May it was reported that about two thousand businesses were told to close again when a cluster of a hundred infected individuals was discovered; contact tracing is being done on 11,000 people.[652]

Europe

Cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents in Europe. The numbers are not comparable, as the testing strategy differs among countries and time periods.

As of 13 March 2020, when the number of new cases became greater than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[653][654] Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days.[655] As of 17 March, all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case.[656] At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City. As of 18 March, more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe.[657] As of 24 May, 68 days since its first recorded case, [658][659] but this situation lasted only 44 days before a newly imported case was identified there.[660] As of 24 May, 68 days since its first recorded case, Montenegro became the first COVID-19-free country in Europe,but this situation lasted only 44 days before a newly imported case was identified there.

Italy

The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 in Rome.[531] Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.[661] An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.[662]

On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.[663] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, ""In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas.""[664][665]

On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April,[666] but on 9 March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.[667] On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.[668][669]

On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.[670][671][672] On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.[673][674] On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.[675] As of 12 June , there were 236,305 confirmed cases, 34,223 deaths, and 173,085 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.[676] A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.[677] On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.[678]

Prior to 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.[697][698] As a result, the government received criticism for the perceived lack of pace and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.[699][700]

On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising against all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.[701][702] On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible,[703] and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.[704]

On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through the issuing of fines and the dispersal of gatherings. Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed ""essential"", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages.[705]

On 24 April it was reported that one of the more promising vaccine trials had begun in England; the government has pledged, in total, more than 50 million pounds towards research.[706]

VE Day celebrations took place under lockdown in the United Kingdom as in this socially-distanced street party in Wetherby , West Yorkshire.

To ensure the UK health services had sufficient capacity to treat people with COVID-19, a number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.[707] The first to be operational was the 4000-bed capacity NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed within the ExCeL convention centre over nine days.[708] On 4 May, it was announced that the Nightingale Hospital in London would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities.[709] This followed reports that NHS Nightingale in London ""treated 51 patients"" within the first three weeks of opening.[710] On 5 May, official figures revealed that Britain had the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The death toll in the United Kingdom was nearly 29,427 for those tested positive for the virus. Later, it was calculated at 32,313, after taking the official death count for Scotland and Northern Ireland into account.[711] On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.[712]

France

Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.[536][537] A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.[713][714]

On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places,[715] and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May.[716][717][718] As of 23 April , France has reported more than 120,804 confirmed cases, 21,856 deaths, and 42,088 recoveries,[719] ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.[720] In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.[721] On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.[722]

Sweden

Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.[723] Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favored forgoing a lockdown in an attempt to reach herd immunity.[724] The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.[723][725] On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.[726]

North America

United States

Cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents by county

On 20 January 2020, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 15 January.[727] On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency,[728] and restricted entry for travellers from China who were not U.S. citizens.[729]

On 28 January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they had developed their own testing kit.[730] Despite this, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the extent of the outbreak.[731][732] Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test.[731][732]

By 2 March there were 80 confirmed cases, half of them in California. Florida and New York had declared their first two cases and the state of Washington reported many suspected cases and the first death. Vice President Pence maintained that the threat of the virus spreading throughout the U.S. was small.[733][734][735]

On 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.[736][737] Corporations encouraged employees to work from home.[738] Sports events and seasons were cancelled.[23]

On 13 March, Trump declared a national emergency, which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis.[739] Beginning on 15 March, many businesses closed or reduced hours[740] and schools across the country were shutting down.[741][742] By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia.[743] On 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than any other country.[534] U.S. federal health inspectors surveyed 323 hospitals in late March; reporting ""severe shortages"" of test supplies, ""widespread shortages"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results.[744]

On 22 April, it was reported that two Californians had died from the virus (not, as previously thought, influenza) on 6 and 17 February, three weeks before the first official COVID-19 death in the U.S. had been acknowledged.[538] By 24 April, 889,309 cases had been confirmed and 50,256 people had died.[745] As of 17 May, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,474,600 people had been infected and at least 88,600 had died in the United States. The Times said that prior to 29 April only deaths confirmed through testing were reported, but new criteria include probable cases and deaths. As of 17 May, the U.S., which accounts for about 4.25 percent of the world's population, had about 29 percent of the confirmed coronavirus deaths.[746]

The White House has been criticised for downplaying the threat and controlling the messaging, directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence.[747] On 14 April, President Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying they mismanaged the pandemic. He also said the U.S. would not participate in a global effort with the WHO to develop a vaccine and drugs to combat the virus.[748] On 1 May the CDC presented a 17-page report titled ""Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework"" to the administration, written to provide advice for faith leaders, places of business and other public places, educators, and state and local officials as they reopened. The White House refused to use the report, and Trump said he felt the guidelines were too restrictive, commenting ""I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was.""[749][750]

By mid-May reports of new cases began to level off and most states began to open restaurants and other places of business, placing limits to the numbers of people allowed in the establishment at the same time. The head of the NIAID, Anthony Fauci, warned that if caution was not used the rate of infections could rebound and he was particularly concerned about opening the schools in the fall. President Trump expressed disapproval of Fauci's statements, saying ""To me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.""[751] By mid-June, new cases began to rise once again, with increases in the percent of positive tests and number of hospitalizations occurring in states such as Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona.[752]

South America

[753] By 3 April, all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case.[754] The pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on 26 February 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo By 3 April, all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case. On April 17, the highest number of cases and deaths was registered in Brazil,[755] followed by Peru and Chile in the number of confirmed cases.[756] On May 13, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of infection with 23,091 deaths. On May 22, citing especially the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared that South America is presently the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.[757][758] As of June 26, South America has more than 2 million confirmed cases and more than 81,000 deaths. However, due to a dearth of testing and medical facilities it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show.[759] As of June 26, South America has more than 2 million confirmed cases and more than 81,000 deaths. However, due to a dearth of testing and medical facilities it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show.

Brazil

On 20 May it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.[760] On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a ""little flu"" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of U.S. president Donald Trump he has been called the ""Trump of the Tropics"".[761]

In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.[762] On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.[763]

Africa

Oceania

On 19 May 2020, Australia filed a motion with the UN for an inquiry into the origins of the virus, and the response of the UN and governments. More than 100 countries supported this motion, and it was passed unanimously.[772][773]

International responses

Travel restrictions

As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,[774] or for all travellers.[775] Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.[776] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.[777] Researchers concluded that ""travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic"" and ""restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late"".[778]

The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy,[779][780] a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.[781][782]

Evacuation of foreign citizens

Ukraine evacuates Ukrainian and foreign citizens from Wuhan , China.

Owing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India,[783] Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.[784] Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.[785][786] On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.[787] Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.[788]

On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess,[789] and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.[790] In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.[791][792] On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.[793]

International aid

Aid to China

Some Chinese students at American universities sent aid, including 50,000 N95 masks on 30 January.[794] The humanitarian aid organisation Direct Relief sent 200,000 face masks and other personal protective equipment to the Wuhan Union Hospital the same day.[795] On 5 February, the Chinese foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China,[796] and Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts and protect ""at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia"".[797] Interaksyon said the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 February after Philippine senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.[798] On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 million worth of aid to China.[799]

Several countries donated masks, medical equipment or money to China, including Japan,[800] Turkey, Russia,[801] Malaysia,[802] Germany,[803] and Canada.[804][805] The U.S. State Department said on 7 February it had facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China.[806] The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to aid their fights against the virus,[807] though on 21 March China said it had not received epidemic funding from the U.S. government and reiterated that on 3 April.[citation needed] Several corporations have also donated money or medical equipment to China.[808]

Aid to the world

Medical supplies donated by China being received at Villamor Air Base in the Philippines

After cases in China stabilised, the country began sending aid to other nations.[809] In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak;[810][811] China sent three medical teams and donated more than forty tons of medical supplies to Italy.[812] Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.[813][814] He later sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators to Panama.[815]

The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concerns over Chinese-made masks and test kits.[816] For instance, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of 30 percent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks which were said to be defective,[817] but China said this was due to misuse.[818] Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China but were in fact from Colombia.[819] The Philippines stopped using test kits donated by China due to their 40 percent accuracy.[820] The Chinese government said product instructions might not have been followed, and that some products were not purchased directly from certified companies.[821] Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.[822][823] On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.[824] According to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey provides the largest amount of humanitarian aid in the world while ranking third worldwide in supplying medical aid.[825][826]

WHO response measures

Taiwan posted an inquiry to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[827][828] The WHO has commended the Chinese authorities for providing ""regular updates"", contrasting it to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when they were accused of secrecy.[829] The WHO said on 5 January that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported,[830] and issued technical briefings on 10 and 11 January warning of risks of human-to-human transmission and urging precautions due to the similarity to earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks.[831] though in public announcements it said there was ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" as late as 14 January.[832] On 20 January, the WHO said it was ""now very clear"" human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had occurred, given that healthcare workers had been infected.[833] On 27 January, the WHO assessed the risk of the outbreak to be ""high at the global level"".[834]

On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), warning that ""all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread"" of the virus,[7][835] following an increase in cases outside China. This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was due to ""the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems"" but that the WHO did not ""recommend limiting trade and movement"".[7][836][837]

WHO representatives with Tehran city managers

On 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide the ""power of the entire UN system in the response"". A UN Crisis Management Team was activated, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations, which the WHO said will allow them to ""focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak"".[838] On 25 February, the WHO declared ""the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic,"" stating that while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be ""in a phase of preparedness"".[839] On 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from ""high"" to ""very high"", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.[840] On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.[841] The Director-General said the WHO was ""deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction"".[8] Critics have said the WHO handled the pandemic inadequately and that the PHEIC and pandemic classification came too late.[842] The third meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee on 30 April renewed the declaration of PHEIC for the second time.[843]

Impact

Economics

""Those who can, put something in; those who can't, help yourself."" Bologna , April 2020.

The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[844] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.[845][846] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08)[847] and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent.[848] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.[849] Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.[850] Many consider an economic recession likely.[851][852]

Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season and 9/11, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.[853]

A highway sign on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto discouraging non-essential travel

Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.[854] The cruise line industry was hard hit,[855] and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.[856] International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.[857]

The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.[858] Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop.[859] This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.[860]

Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.[861][862] More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.[863] According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.[864]

Supply shortages

Coronavirus fears have led to panic buying of essentials across the world, including toilet paper, dried and/or instant noodles, bread, rice, vegetables, disinfectant, and rubbing alcohol.

The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.[865] The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust).[866] The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.[867] According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.[868][869] It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.[870]

The impact of the coronavirus outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine. The Yuancheng Group, headquartered in Wuhan, China, is one of the leading suppliers.[871] Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the street of the UK.[872] U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.[873]

The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.[874][875] David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said ""we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.""[876]

Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.[877][876][878]

Oil and other energy markets

In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ""scrambled"" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[879] On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.[880] June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.[880]

Culture

The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.[881] In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.[882][883][884]

Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.[883] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.[885][886][883] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims,[883] other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.[883] Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed,[614][621] while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.[887][888]

The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,[889] 2019–20 Premier League,[890] UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season,[891] and 2019–20 NHL season.[892] The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that they will be ""rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021"".[893][894]

The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.[895][896] The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in the Netherlands in May, was cancelled, however the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.[897][898] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.[899] Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts[900] or creating web-based ""festivals"" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.[901] Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.[902]

Politics

The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities,[903] isolations or deaths of multiple politicians,[904] and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.[905]

Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus.[906]

China

The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States government,[907] UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove,[908] and others[909] for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.[910] The U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases.[911] The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.[912][913]

Italy

In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy[914][915]—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said ""only China responded bilaterally"", not the EU.[916] On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.[917] President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.[918] Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.[919] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary.""[920] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant,[921] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.[922]

United States

The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.[924][925][926] Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election.[927][928] Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.[929]

Other countries

The planned NATO ""Defender 2020"" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.[930][931] The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying ""it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating.""[932]

The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.[624][933] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.[934] Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.[935]

Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.[936] South Korea criticised Japan's ""ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts"" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.[937] South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.[649]

Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.[938][939] In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.[940] In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.[941] In some countries, including Egypt,[942] Turkey,[943] and Thailand,[940] opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.[944]

Xenophobia and racism

Since the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent.[992][993][994] Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people deserving the virus.[995][996][997] Citizens in countries including Malaysia,[998] New Zealand,[999] Singapore,[1000] Japan,[1001] Vietnam,[1002] and South Korea lobbied to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.[1003] Chinese people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.[1004][1005][1006] U.S. president Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"", which critics say is racist and anti-Chinese.[1007][1008][1009]

[1010] Houston's Chinatown experienced a reduction in business early during the outbreak when there were still only a few cases.

Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[1011][1012] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.[1013] Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown.[1014] Racism and xenophobia towards South Asians and Southeast Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[1015][1016][1017] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.[1018][1019]

In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been inflamed by the pandemic; a comic posted on Weibo described foreigners as ""foreign garbage"" targeted for ""disposal"".[1020] Some black people were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.[1021] Other harassment, discrimination and evictions of Africans in China were alleged.[1022] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.[1023] A McDonald's branch in Guangzhou barring black sparked anger in China and overseas, and McDonald's closed the location.[1024]

Information dissemination

Many newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts,[1025] while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.[1026] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.[1027]

Misinformation

April that [1028] (1:05 min) U.S. president Donald Trump suggested at a press briefing on 23April that disinfectant injections or exposure to ultraviolet light might help treat COVID-19. There is no evidence that either could be a viable method.

[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan , China, in December 2019. [4] [6] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March. [7] [8] As of 3 July 2020, more than 10.8  million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories , resulting in more than 521,000 deaths ; more than 5.76  million people have recovered. [5]   The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, [c] most often via small droplets produced by coughing, [d] sneezing, and talking. [9] [10] [12] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances . [9] However, research as of June 2020 [update] has shown that speech-generated droplets may remain airborne for tens of minutes. [13] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. [9] [10] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms. [9] [10]  Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue , shortness of breath , and loss of sense of smell . [9] [14] [15] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . [16] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days. [17] [18] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment . [9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy . [19]  Recommended preventive measures include hand washing , covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people , wearing a face mask in public settings, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected. [9] [20] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions , lockdowns , workplace hazard controls , and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons. The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption, [21] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression . [22] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting , religious , political , and cultural events, [23]  widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying , [24] [25] [26] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases . [27] [28]  Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population. [29]  Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media. [30] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.

Background  On 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan , Hubei, [333] [334] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. [335] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions. [336] [337]  Several early infected had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market ; [338] the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin. [339] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, [340]  pangolin coronaviruses, [341] [342] and SARS-CoV . [343] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin. [344] [345] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines . [346]  The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1  December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. [347] [348] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market. [349] [350] [351] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected. [352] [353]  The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [354] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly passed China's. [355]   Cases  Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory and COVID-19 pandemic cases  Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 , and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols. [356] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population. [357] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms. [358] [359] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases. [360] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases. [361] [362]  On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt , the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies. [363] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported. [364] [365] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review. [366]  Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20. [367] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested. [368] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults. [369] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population. [370]  Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5, [371] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9). [372] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity . By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.

For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from  6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days. [379] As of 3 July 2020, approximately 521,000 [5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June [update] , about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes . [380]  The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020. [381] The first death outside of China occurred on 1  February in the Philippines, [382] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February. [383]  Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without testing, e.g. at home or in nursing homes . [384] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting. [385] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries. [386] [387] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City , deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal. [386] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery . [388]  Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality. [389] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, [390] [391] [392] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health. [393] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases. [394]  The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.8 percent (521,355 deaths for 10,874,146 cases) as of 3 July 2020. [5] The number varies by region. [395]  Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known. [396] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China. [397] [398] The University of Oxford 's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2  May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics. [399] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4 percent (0.2 to 1.0 percent) and that 35 percent of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26 percent (as of 20 May).

[8] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, ""Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be."" [403] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required ""until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)"". [404] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is ""so readily transmissible"", it ""might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year"". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation. [405]   Signs and symptoms  Further information: Coronavirus disease 2019 § Signs and symptoms   Symptoms of COVID-19 [406]  The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days. [9] [407] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers ; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible. [408] As at 6  April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5  to 80 percent. [409]  Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific ; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production ( phlegm ), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood , diarrhea, and rash. [410] [411] [412]  Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing. [9] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. [15] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome , sepsis , septic shock , and kidney failure . [411]   Cause  Transmission  Further information: Coronavirus disease 2019    Respiratory droplets produced when a man sneezes , visualised using Tyndall scattering  COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing. [12] [413] The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance; [9] the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 metres (6 ft). [10] People can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, but it is unclear how often this happens. [9] [10] [12] A June 2020 review found the likelihood of those infected that are asymptomatic to be 40-45%. [414]  People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission). [12] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases. [12]  When the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. [9] On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection, [12] and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads. [10] It is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic ( polypropylene ) and stainless steel ( AISI 304 ). [12] [415] [416] Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands. [9] Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body. [417]  Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus. [9] [10] [12] [418] Although COVID‑19 is not a sexually transmitted infection , kissing, intimate contact, and faecal-oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus. [419] [420] Some medical procedures are aerosol-generating , [421] and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal. [9] [12]  COVID‑19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its spread are still under investigation. [9] [10] [12] It spreads easily between people—easier than influenza but not as easily as measles . [10] Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID-19 (the R0) have varied widely. The WHO's initial estimates of the R0 were 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however a more recent [ when? ] review found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79. [422]  The virus may occur in breast milk, but it's unknown whether it's infectious and transmittable to the baby. [423] [424]  Virology  Main article: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2   Illustration of SARSr‑CoV virion  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a novel virus , first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. [343] All features of the novel SARS‑CoV‑2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature. [425]  SARS‑CoV‑2 is closely related to SARS‑CoV , and is thought to have a zoonotic origin. [340] SARS‑CoV‑2 genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus , and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples [426] and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus. [427]   Diagnosis  Main article: COVID-19 testing   Demonstration of a swab for COVID-19 testing  COVID-19 can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest. [428] [429]   Viral testing  The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab , though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. [430]  A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests , which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. [431] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK. [432]  On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new ""spit test"" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton , having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University , with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs, and could enable people to conduct it at home. [433]   Imaging   A CT scan of a person with COVID‑19 shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungs.  Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions . [434] The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. [435] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus , imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19. [434] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive . [429]   Prevention  Further information: Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 , Pandemic prevention , preparations prior to COVID-19 , COVID-19 surveillance , and COVID-19 apps   Infographic by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), describing how to stop the spread of germs  Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public. [436] [437]  Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. [438] [439] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions , contact precautions, and eye protection. [440]  Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak. [441] The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected. [442]  Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective. [443] There is no COVID-19 vaccine , though many organisations are working to develop one. [444]   Hand washing  Main article: Hand washing  Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. [20] CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available. [436] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. [437] [445] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections. [446]   Surface cleaning  Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol , 50–100 percent isopropanol , 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite , 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide , and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine . Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate , are less effective. [447] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected. [448]   Face masks and respiratory hygiene  Main article: Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic  Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen wearing a surgical mask Slovakia was among the first countries in the world to make the wearing of masks mandatory in public. [449]  Recommendations for wearing cloth masks have been a subject of debate. [450] The WHO originally recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19. [451] China and the United States, among other countries, have encouraged the use of face masks or cloth face coverings more generally by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus by asymptomatic individuals as a precautionary principle . [452] [453] Several national and local governments have made wearing masks mandatory. [454]  Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing this type of mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing. [451]  In June 2020, the WHO changed its policy on wearing face masks, saying they should be worn in public places to help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. [455]   Social distancing  Main article: Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic   Physical distancing in Toronto , with a limited number of customers allowed inside a store  Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others. [437] [456] [457] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak. [458] [459] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic. [460]  The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10. [461] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. [462] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary. [457]  Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension , and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak. [463] [464]  In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term ""social distancing"" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation , rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means. [465] [466] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus. [467] [468]   Self-isolation   Without pandemic containment measures—such as social distancing, vaccination, and use of face masks—pathogens can spread exponentially. [469] This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population.  Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. [470] [471]  Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. [472] [473] The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups. [474] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. [9] [17] [475]   Management  Further information: Coronavirus disease 2019 § Management , and Pandemic § Management  Screening, containment and mitigation  Further information: Flatten the curve   Goals of mitigation include delaying and reducing peak burden on healthcare ( flattening the curve ) and lessening overall cases and health impact. [476] [477] Moreover, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity ( raising the line ) such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand. [478]   Mitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or duration—such as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home orders—can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation. [476] [479]  Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression) and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus. [480] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time. [481] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1. [404]  Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve. [476] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed. [476] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning. [482]  More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans. [483] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies. [484]  Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs. [404]   Contact tracing  See also: Management of COVID-19 § Information technology , and Government by algorithm  Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission. [485] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance. [486]  Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7  April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones. [486] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.) [486]  On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography . [487] [488] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms. [489] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services. [490]   Health care  Further information: Flatten the curve , list of countries by hospital beds , and Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic   An army-constructed field hospital outside Östra sjukhuset ( Eastern hospital ) in Gothenburg , Sweden, contains temporary intensive care units for COVID-19 patients.  Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure. [491] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds. [491] [492] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually. [493] [494] [495]  Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains , some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts. [496] [497] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight. [498] [499] [500] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval. [501] [502]   Treatment  Main articles: COVID-19 drug development and COVID-19 vaccine   An exhausted anesthesiologist physician in Pesaro , Italy, March 2020  Antiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19 [503] None has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials. [503] However, remdesivir may affect the time it takes to recover from the virus. [504]  Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1  May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19. [505] The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks. [505] [506]  Taking over-the-counter cold medications, [507] drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms. [436] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy , intravenous fluids , and breathing support may be required. [508]  Other trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it. [503] [509] On 16 June, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support, [510] though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes. [511] Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint. [512]   History  Main article: Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic   Cumulative per capita confirmed COVID-19 cases ►  Interactive timeline map of confirmed cases per million people (drag circle to adjust; may not work on mobile)  There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero ) originated. [513] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province. [514] There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were ""patient zero"". [514] Starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December [515] and at least 266 by 31 December. [516]  According to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market , which also sold live animals. [339] In May 2020, George Gao , the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak. [517]  On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. [518] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. [519]  On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS , causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3  January), [520] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Fen , was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm. [521] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about ""the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause"". [522] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases [333] [523] [524] —enough to trigger an investigation. [335]  During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. [525] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces , helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange. [426] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen . [526] A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later) [527] and more may have been infected. [528] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its ""pandemic potential"". [349] [529] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern . [528] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times [ clarification needed ] . [530]  On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China. [531] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic. [532] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths. [533] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. [534] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. [535] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019 [536] [537] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6  February 2020. [538]  On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being reported, [539] the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June. [540] As for 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed. [541] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market . [539] [542]  As of 3 July 2020, more than 10.8  million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 521,000 people have died and more than 5.76  million have recovered. [543] [544]   National responses  Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns , COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory , and National responses to the COVID-19 pandemic  A total of 188 [5] countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe , many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls. [545] National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders , shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns). [546]  By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, [547] which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population . [548] [549]  By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy , Spain , France , and the United Kingdom , while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America. [550] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, [551] around 100 million people in the Philippines, [550] about 59 million people in South Africa , [552] and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India . [553] [554] On 21 May 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5  million cases were surpassed. [555]   Asia  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Asia  As of 19 May 2020 [update] , cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea , although these countries likely also have cases. [556] [557] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly South Korea , [558]  Taiwan , [559] and Vietnam , [560] has allowed them to fare comparatively well.  China  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China   Confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants by province, as of 13 April, showing Hubei with around 40 times more cases than any other province  Hubei Province: 114.40 cases per 100,000   1.5–2.5 cases per 100,000   1–1.5 cases per 100,000   0.5–1 cases per 100,000   >0–0.5 cases per 100,000   Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during the COVID-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting  The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1  December 2019 in Wuhan; [347] one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November. [352] Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December, upon which her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan  CDC on 27 December. [561] [562] Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus. [561] A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December, confirming 27 cases and suggesting wearing face masks. [524] The WHO was informed on the same day. [333] As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for ""spreading rumours"" about the outbreak. [563] The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission. [564] In a 14 January conference call, Chinese officials said privately that human-to-human transmission was a possibility, and pandemic preparations were needed. [565] In a briefing posted during the night of 14–15 January, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out. [566]  On 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus. [567] That same day, Chinese Communist Party  general secretary  Xi Jinping and State Council  premier  Li Keqiang issued their first public comments about the virus, telling people in infected areas to practice social distancing and avoid travel. [568] [569] During the Chinese New Year travel period, authorities instigated a City of Wuhan lockdown. [570] On 10 February the Chinese government launched a radical campaign described by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi as a "" people's war "" to contain the viral spread. [571] In ""the largest quarantine in human history"", [572] a cordon sanitaire on 23 January stopped travel in and out of Wuhan, [573] [574] then extended to fifteen Hubei cities affecting about 57 million people. [575] Private vehicle use was banned in the city. [576] Several Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were also cancelled. [577] Authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital , completed in ten days. [578]  Leishenshan Hospital , was later built to handle additional patients. [579] China also converted other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. [580]   Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital , an emergency speciality field hospital built in response to the pandemic A temporary hospital for treating mild cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan , one of more than ten such hospitals in the city [581]  On 26 January, the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday. [582] Universities and schools around the country were also closed. [583] [584] [585] The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities. [586]  Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions. [587] Travel restrictions were enacted in and outside of Hubei. [587] [588] Public transport was modified, [589] and museums throughout China were temporarily closed. [587] [590] [591] Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction. [592] In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs . [593] Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. [594] [595]  After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus re-entering China from other countries. For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. [596] At the same time, a strong anti-foreigner sentiment quickly took hold, [597] and foreigners experienced harassment by the general public [598] and forced evictions from apartments and hotels. [599] [600]  On 24 March, Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China. [601] The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. [602] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end. Those wishing to enter China must to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates. [603] [604] The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms. [605]  The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 4  April, coinciding with Qingming Festival , although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing to avoid a renewed COVID-19 outbreak. [606] On 25 April the last patients were discharged in Wuhan. [607] On 13 May the city of Jilin was put on lockdown, sparking fear of a second wave of infection. [608]   Iran  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Iran   Disinfection of Tehran Metro trains against coronavirus. Similar measures have also been taken in other countries. [609]  Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS‑CoV‑2 infections on 19 February in Qom , where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education , two people had died that day. [610] [611] Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, [612] sporting events, [613] Friday prayers, [614] and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools. [615] Iran allocated 5  trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000 ) to combat the virus. [616] President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined. [617] Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, [618] although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued. [619]  Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March. [620] [621]  Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February. [622] [623] More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date. [623] [624] The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3  March. [625] On 15 March, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began. [626] At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March. [627] By 23 March, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus. [628] According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak. [629] The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran. [630] On 20 April it was reported that Iran had reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country, though there is a fear of the second wave of infection due to this move. [631] After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4  June, raising fear of a second wave. [632]   South Korea  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea   A drive-through test centre at the Gyeongju Public Health Centre  COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, [633] largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus . [633] [634] Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak. [635] [636] By 22 February [update] , among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms. [637]  South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020. [638] On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, [639] rising to 3,150 on 29 February. [640] All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus. [635] Airline schedules were also changed. [641] [642]    A banner in Seoul displays coronavirus infection prevention tips.  South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them. [558] [643] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, [644]  drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day, [645] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day. [646] South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities. [558] [647] [648]  South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in 's response to the crisis, many signing petitions either praising it or calling for impeachment. [649] On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks. [646] On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1  April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks. [650] Per media reports on 1  April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries. [651] On 15 May it was reported that about two thousand businesses were told to close again when a cluster of a hundred infected individuals was discovered; contact tracing is being done on 11,000 people. [652]   Europe   Cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents in Europe. The numbers are not comparable, as the testing strategy differs among countries and time periods.  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Europe   As of 13 March 2020, [update] when the number of new cases became greater  than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the pandemic . [653] [654] Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days. [655]  As of 17 March, [update] all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19 , with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case. [656] At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City . As of 18 March, [update] more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe. [657]  As of 24 May, 68 days since its first recorded case, Montenegro became the first COVID-19-free country in Europe, [658] [659] but this situation lasted only 44 days before a newly imported case was identified there. [660]  Italy  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy  The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 in Rome. [531] Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency. [661] An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. [662]    Civil Protection volunteers conduct health checks at the Guglielmo Marconi Airport in Bologna on 5  February.  On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy. [663] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, ""In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."" [664] [665]  On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April, [666] but on 9  March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month. [667] On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies. [668] [669]  On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols. [670] [671] [672] On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic. [673] [674] On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy. [675] As of 12 June [update] , there were 236,305 confirmed cases, 34,223 deaths, and 173,085 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region. [676] A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate. [677] On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown. [678]   Spain  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Spain   Residents of Valencia , Spain, maintaining social distancing while queueing   The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera , Canary Islands . [679] Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February. [680] By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country. The lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020. [681] On 29 March, it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days. [682] By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates. [683] On 25 March, the death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China , and only that of Italy was higher. [684] On 2  April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day. [685] On 17 May, the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time, [686] and 1 June was the first day without deaths by coronavirus. [687] The state of alarm ended on 21 June. [688]  As of 21 June 2020 [update] , there have been 248,770 confirmed cases and 28,343 deaths. [689] The actual number of cases was considered to be much higher, as many people with only mild or no symptoms were unlikely to have been tested. [690] [691] On 4 June, the results of the second wave of a Spanish Government nation-wide seroprevalence study showed that the percentage of population which could have been infected during the pandemic would be around 5,2% [692] , approximately 2 million people, [693] a figure ten times higher than the number of confirmed cases on that date. According to this study based on sample of more than 63,000 people, Madrid and several provinces of Castilla–La Mancha and Castilla y León would be the most affected areas with a percentage of infection greater than 10%. [694] [695] The number of deaths is also believed to be an underestimate due to lack of testing and reporting, perhaps by as much as 15,815 according to the Spanish Ministry of Health monitoring system on daily excess mortality (Sistema de Monitorización de la Mortalidad Diaria - MoMo). [696]  United Kingdom  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom   The ""Wee Annie"" statue in Gourock , Scotland, was given a face mask during the pandemic.  Prior to 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens. [697] [698] As a result, the government received criticism for the perceived lack of pace and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public. [699] [700]  On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising against all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres. [701] [702] On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible, [703] and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. [704]  On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through the issuing of fines and the dispersal of gatherings. Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed ""essential"", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages. [705]  On 24 April it was reported that one of the more promising vaccine trials had begun in England; the government has pledged, in total, more than 50 million pounds towards research. [706]    VE Day celebrations took place under lockdown in the United Kingdom as in this socially-distanced street party in Wetherby , West Yorkshire.  To ensure the UK health services had sufficient capacity to treat people with COVID-19, a number of temporary critical care hospitals were built. [707] The first to be operational was the 4000-bed capacity NHS Nightingale Hospital London , constructed within the ExCeL convention centre over nine days. [708] On 4  May, it was announced that the Nightingale Hospital in London would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities. [709] This followed reports that NHS Nightingale in London ""treated 51 patients"" within the first three weeks of opening. [710] On 5  May, official figures revealed that Britain had the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The death toll in the United Kingdom was nearly 29,427 for those tested positive for the virus. Later, it was calculated at 32,313, after taking the official death count for Scotland and Northern Ireland into account. [711] On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available. [712]   France  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in France   France has been transferring COVID-19 patients from overloaded hospitals to hospitals in other regions via military helicopters, as seen here at Strasbourg Airport .  Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux , it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples. [536] [537] A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse , which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus. [713] [714]  On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places, [715] and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May. [716] [717] [718] As of 23 April [update] , France has reported more than 120,804 confirmed cases, 21,856 deaths, and 42,088 recoveries, [719] ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases. [720] In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs . [721] On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups. [722]   Sweden  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden  Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open. [723] Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favored forgoing a lockdown in an attempt to reach herd immunity . [724]  The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping. [723] [725] On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day. [726]   North America  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in North America  United States  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in the United States   Cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents by county  On 20 January 2020, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 15 January. [727] On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency , [728] and restricted entry for travellers from China who were not U.S. citizens. [729]  On 28 January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they had developed their own testing kit. [730] Despite this, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the extent of the outbreak. [731] [732] Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test. [731] [732]  By 2 March there were 80 confirmed cases, half of them in California . Florida and New York had declared their first two cases and the state of Washington reported many suspected cases and the first death. Vice President Pence maintained that the threat of the virus spreading throughout the U.S. was small. [733] [734] [735]    Donald Trump signs the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law with Alex Azar on 6  March 2020.  On 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act , which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. [736] [737] Corporations encouraged employees to work from home. [738] Sports events and seasons were cancelled. [23]  On 13 March, Trump declared a national emergency , which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis. [739] Beginning on 15 March, many businesses closed or reduced hours [740] and schools across the country were shutting down. [741] [742] By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia. [743] On 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than any other country. [534]  U.S. federal health inspectors surveyed 323 hospitals in late March; reporting ""severe shortages"" of test supplies, ""widespread shortages"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results. [744]    The hospital ship USNS Comfort arrives in Manhattan .  On 22 April, it was reported that two Californians had died from the virus (not, as previously thought, influenza) on 6  and 17 February, three weeks before the first official COVID-19 death in the U.S. had been acknowledged. [538] By 24 April, 889,309 cases had been confirmed and 50,256 people had died. [745] As of 17 May, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,474,600 people had been infected and at least 88,600 had died in the United States. The Times said that prior to 29 April only deaths confirmed through testing were reported, but new criteria include probable cases and deaths. As of 17 May, the U.S., which accounts for about 4.25 percent of the world's population, had about 29 percent of the confirmed coronavirus deaths. [746]  The White House has been criticised for downplaying the threat and controlling the messaging, directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence . [747] On 14 April, President Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying they mismanaged the pandemic. He also said the U.S. would not participate in a global effort with the WHO to develop a vaccine and drugs to combat the virus. [748] On 1  May the CDC presented a 17-page report titled ""Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework"" to the administration, written to provide advice for faith leaders, places of business and other public places, educators, and state and local officials as they reopened. The White House refused to use the report, and Trump said he felt the guidelines were too restrictive, commenting ""I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was."" [749] [750]  By mid-May reports of new cases began to level off and most states began to open restaurants and other places of business, placing limits to the numbers of people allowed in the establishment at the same time. The head of the NIAID , Anthony Fauci , warned that if caution was not used the rate of infections could rebound and he was particularly concerned about opening the schools in the fall. President Trump expressed disapproval of Fauci's statements, saying ""To me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools."" [751] By mid-June, new cases began to rise once again, with increases in the percent of positive tests and number of hospitalizations occurring in states such as Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona. [752]   South America  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in South America   Workers being trained to disinfect buses in Olinda , Pernambuco, Brazil, 16 March 2020  The pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on 26 February 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo . [753] By 3 April, all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case. [754]  On April 17, the highest number of cases and deaths was registered in Brazil , [755] followed by Peru and Chile in the number of confirmed cases. [756]  On May 13, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of infection with 23,091 deaths. On May 22, citing especially the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared that South America is presently the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic. [757] [758]  As of June 26, South America has more than 2 million confirmed cases and more than 81,000 deaths. However, due to a dearth of testing and medical facilities it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show. [759]  Brazil  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil  On 20 May it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States. [760] On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a ""little flu"" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of U.S. president Donald Trump he has been called the ""Trump of the Tropics"". [761]  In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5  June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6  June, with only the number of infections of previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths. [762] On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases. [763]   Africa   Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Africa   U.S. Air Force airmen unload a C-17 aircraft carrying approximately 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) of medical supplies in Niamey, Niger 23 April 2020.  According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems ""are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks"". [764] [765] Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimise lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned day by day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent's 1.3 billion people in 2020. [766] Most of the reported cases are from six countries: South Africa , Nigeria , Ghana , Morocco , Egypt and Algeria , but it is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in other African countries with poorer health care systems. [767] Cases have been confirmed in all African countries, with Lesotho the last country to report its first coronavirus case on 13 May 2020. [768] There have been no reported cases in the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha . [769]    Oceania  Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Oceania  The pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne , Australia . [770] It has since spread elsewhere in the region, [771] although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 1 July, ten Oceania sovereign states have yet to report a case - Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Federated State of Micronesia , Nauru , Palau , Samoa , Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  On 19 May 2020, Australia filed a motion with the UN for an inquiry into the origins of the virus, and the response of the UN and governments. More than 100 countries supported this motion, and it was passed unanimously. [772] [773]   International responses  Further information: Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic  Travel restrictions  Main article: Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic  As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas, [774] or for all travellers. [775] Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 . [776] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions. [777] Researchers concluded that ""travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic"" and ""restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late"". [778]  The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy, [779] [780] a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians. [781] [782]   Evacuation of foreign citizens  Main article: Evacuations related to the COVID-19 pandemic   Ukraine evacuates Ukrainian and foreign citizens from Wuhan , China.  Owing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India, [783] Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens. [784] Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people. [785] [786] On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk. [787] Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China. [788]  On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess , [789] and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship. [790] In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. [791] [792] On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic. [793]   International aid  Aid to China  Some Chinese students at American universities sent aid, including 50,000 N95 masks on 30 January. [794] The humanitarian aid organisation Direct Relief sent 200,000 face masks and other personal protective equipment to the Wuhan Union Hospital the same day. [795] On 5  February, the Chinese foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China, [796] and Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts and protect ""at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia"". [797]  Interaksyon said the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6  February after Philippine senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan. [798] On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 million worth of aid to China. [799]  Several countries donated masks, medical equipment or money to China, including Japan, [800] Turkey, Russia, [801] Malaysia, [802] Germany, [803] and Canada. [804] [805] The U.S. State Department said on 7  February it had facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China. [806] The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to aid their fights against the virus, [807] though on 21 March China said it had not received epidemic funding from the U.S. government and reiterated that on 3  April. [ citation needed ] Several corporations have also donated money or medical equipment to China. [808]   Aid to the world   Medical supplies donated by China being received at Villamor Air Base in the Philippines  After cases in China stabilised, the country began sending aid to other nations. [809] In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak; [810] [811] China sent three medical teams and donated more than forty tons of medical supplies to Italy. [812] Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union. [813] [814] He later sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5  ventilators to Panama. [815]  The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concerns over Chinese-made masks and test kits. [816] For instance, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of 30 percent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks which were said to be defective, [817] but China said this was due to misuse. [818] Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China but were in fact from Colombia. [819] The Philippines stopped using test kits donated by China due to their 40 percent accuracy. [820] The Chinese government said product instructions might not have been followed, and that some products were not purchased directly from certified companies. [821] Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. [822] [823] On 2  April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries. [824] According to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey provides the largest amount of humanitarian aid in the world while ranking third worldwide in supplying medical aid. [825] [826]   WHO response measures  Main article: World Health Organization's response to the COVID-19 pandemic   WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom  Taiwan posted an inquiry to the WHO on 31 December 2019. [827] [828] The WHO has commended the Chinese authorities for providing ""regular updates"", contrasting it to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when they were accused of secrecy. [829] The WHO said on 5  January that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported, [830] and issued technical briefings on 10 and 11 January warning of risks of human-to-human transmission and urging precautions due to the similarity to earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks. [831] though in public announcements it said there was ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" as late as 14 January. [832] On 20 January, the WHO said it was ""now very clear"" human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had occurred, given that healthcare workers had been infected. [833] On 27 January, the WHO assessed the risk of the outbreak to be ""high at the global level"". [834]  On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), warning that ""all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread"" of the virus, [7] [835] following an increase in cases outside China. This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic . WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was due to ""the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems"" but that the WHO did not ""recommend limiting trade and movement"". [7] [836] [837]    WHO representatives with Tehran city managers  On 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide the ""power of the entire UN system in the response"". A UN Crisis Management Team was activated, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations, which the WHO said will allow them to ""focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak"". [838] On 25 February, the WHO declared ""the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic,"" stating that while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be ""in a phase of preparedness"". [839] On 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from ""high"" to ""very high"", its highest level of alert and risk assessment. [840] On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. [841] The Director-General said the WHO was ""deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction"". [8] Critics have said the WHO handled the pandemic inadequately and that the PHEIC and pandemic classification came too late. [842] The third meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee on 30 April renewed the declaration of PHEIC for the second time. [843]   Impact  Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  Further information: Social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  Economics  Main article: Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  See also: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation , on science and technology , on financial markets , 2020 stock market crash , and Coronavirus recession   ""Those who can, put something in; those who can't, help yourself."" Bologna , April 2020.  The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+  billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years. [844] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China. [845] [846] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08 ) [847] and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent. [848] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook. [849] Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March. [850] Many consider an economic recession likely. [851] [852]  Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season and 9/11, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history. [853]    A highway sign on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto discouraging non-essential travel  Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed. [854] The cruise line industry was hard hit, [855] and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed. [856] International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service. [857]  The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures. [858] Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop. [859] This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. [860]  Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally. [861] [862] More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims. [863] According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic. [864]   Supply shortages  Main article: Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic   Coronavirus fears have led to panic buying of essentials across the world, including toilet paper, dried and/or instant noodles, bread, rice, vegetables, disinfectant, and rubbing alcohol.  The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages , stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations. [865] The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust). [866] The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods. [867] According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom , demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months. [868] [869] It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers. [870]  The impact of the coronavirus outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine . The Yuancheng Group , headquartered in Wuhan, China, is one of the leading suppliers. [871] Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the street of the UK. [872] U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors. [873]  The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis . [874] [875] David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said ""we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."" [876]  Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve , for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020. [877] [876] [878]   Oil and other energy markets  In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ""scrambled"" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China. [879] On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs. [880] June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20. [880]   Culture  Main article: List of events affected by the COVID-19 pandemic  Further information: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage , on cinema , on religion , on sports , on television , on video games , on performing arts , and on music   Closed entrance to the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine in Ray, Iran  The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. [881] In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. [882] [883] [884]    An American Catholic military chaplain prepares for a live-streamed Mass in an empty chapel at Offutt Air Force Base in March 2020.  Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent , were cancelled. [883] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays ; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship. [885] [886] [883] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims , [883] other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras . [883] Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed, [614] [621] while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina. [887] [888]  The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War . Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League , [889]  2019–20 Premier League , [890]  UEFA Euro 2020 , 2019–20 NBA season , [891] and 2019–20 NHL season . [892] The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics , which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that they will be ""rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021"". [893] [894]  The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours. [895] [896] The Eurovision Song Contest , which was due to be held in the Netherlands in May, was cancelled, however the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021. [897] [898] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances. [899] Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts [900] or creating web-based ""festivals"" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work. [901] Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty. [902]   Politics  Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on politics  The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities, [903] isolations or deaths of multiple politicians, [904] and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus. [905]  Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus . [906]   China  Further information: China–United States relations § COVID-19   Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping (left) with State Council Premier Li Keqiang  The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States government , [907] UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove , [908] and others [909] for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party  general secretary  Xi Jinping from the controversy. [910] The U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases. [911] The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently. [912] [913]   Italy  In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union 's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy [914] [915] —Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said ""only China responded bilaterally"", not the EU. [916] On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy. [917]  President of Lombardy  Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid. [918] Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States. [919] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."" [920] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant, [921] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country. [922]   United States   Several hundred anti-lockdown protesters rallied at the Ohio Statehouse 20 April. [923]  The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care , universal child care , paid sick leave , and higher levels of funding for public health. [924] [925] [926] Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election . [927] [928] Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association. [929]   Other countries  The planned NATO "" Defender 2020 "" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War , will be held on a reduced scale. [930] [931] The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament 's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying ""it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating."" [932]  The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected. [624] [933] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran . [934]  Saudi Arabia , which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire. [935]  Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic. [936] South Korea criticised Japan's ""ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts"" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites. [937] South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in 's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response. [649]  Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power. [938] [939] In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic. [940] In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán , to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis. [941] In some countries, including Egypt , [942]  Turkey , [943] and Thailand , [940] opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic. [944]   Education  Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education   Learners affected by school closures caused by COVID-19 as of 7 June 2020 [update]   Country-wide school closures   Localized school closures   No school closures   No data  The pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges. [945]  Most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 . [946] As of 7 June 2020, approximately 1.725  billion learners are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 134 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 38 are implementing local closures, impacting about 98.5 percent of the world's student population. 39 countries' schools are currently open. [947]  On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS & A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries. [948]  International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled. [949] In addition, Advanced Placement Exams, SAT administrations, and ACT administrations have been moved online and cancelled. School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families. [950] but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences. [951] [952] School closures in response to the pandemic have shed light on various social and economic issues , including student debt , [953]  digital learning , [954] [955]  food insecurity , [956] and homelessness , [957] [958] as well as access to childcare , [959]  health care , [960]  housing , [961]  internet , [962] and disability services . [963] The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work. [29] [964]  In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programs and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education. [965]  Other health issues  Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other health issues   The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38 per cent fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40 per cent fewer in Spain. [966] The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, ""My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."" [967] There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment. [967]  Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions. [968]  In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections , including HIV , attributable to COVID-19 quarantines, social distancing measures, and recommendations to not engage in casual sex. [969] [970] Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic. [971] [972] [973]  The pandemic has also negatively impacted mental health globally, including increased loneliness resulting from social distancing. [974]  Environment and climate  Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment  Impact of coronavirus outbreak on environmental issues     Images from the NASA Earth Observatory show a stark drop in pollution in Wuhan, China, when comparing NO 2 levels in early 2019 (top) and early 2020 (bottom). [975]  The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate . The considerable decline in planned travel [976] has caused many regions to experience a large drop in air pollution . In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25  per cent reduction in carbon emissions [977] and  50 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions, [978] which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months. [979] [980] Other positive impacts on the environment include governance -system-controlled investments towards a sustainable energy transition and other goals related to environmental protection such as the European Union 's seven-year €1 trillion budget proposal and €750 billion recovery plan "" Next Generation EU "" which seeks to reserve 25% of EU spending for climate-friendly expenditure. [981] [982] [983] [984] [985]  However, the outbreak has also provided cover for illegal activities such as deforestation of the Amazon rainforest [986] [987] and poaching in Africa, [988] [989] hindered environmental diplomacy efforts, [990] and created economic fallout that some predict will slow investment in green energy technologies. [991]    Xenophobia and racism  Main article: List of incidents of xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic  Since the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent. [992] [993] [994] Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people deserving the virus. [995] [996] [997] Citizens in countries including Malaysia, [998] New Zealand, [999] Singapore, [1000] Japan, [1001] Vietnam, [1002] and South Korea lobbied to ban Chinese people from entering their countries. [1003] Chinese people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults. [1004] [1005] [1006] U.S. president Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"", which critics say is racist and anti-Chinese. [1007] [1008] [1009]    Houston's Chinatown experienced a reduction in business early during the outbreak when there were still only a few cases. [1010]  Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19 ) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia, [1011] [1012] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread. [1013] Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown. [1014] Racism and xenophobia towards South Asians and Southeast Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf . [1015] [1016] [1017] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul. [1018] [1019]  In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been inflamed by the pandemic; a comic posted on Weibo described foreigners as ""foreign garbage"" targeted for ""disposal"". [1020] Some black people were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus. [1021] Other harassment, discrimination and evictions of Africans in China were alleged. [1022] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe. [1023] A McDonald's branch in Guangzhou barring black sparked anger in China and overseas, and McDonald's closed the location. [1024]   Information dissemination  Further information: Media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic , COVID-19 pandemic on social media , and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on journalism  Many newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts, [1025] while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access . [1026] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv . [1027]   Misinformation  Main article: Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic  Play media  U.S. president Donald Trump suggested at a press briefing on 23  April that disinfectant injections or exposure to ultraviolet light might help treat COVID-19. There is no evidence that either could be a viable method. [1028]  (1:05  min)   The pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease . [1029] [1030] [1031] False information, including intentional disinformation , has been spread through social media , [1030] [1032] text messaging, [1033] and mass media , [1034] including the tabloid media , [1035] conservative media, [1036] [1037] and state media of countries such as China, [1038] [1039] Russia, [1040] [1041] Iran, [1042] and Turkmenistan. [1030] [1043] It has also been reportedly spread by covert operations backed by states such as Saudi Arabia, [1044] Russia and China to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries. [1045] [1046] [1047] [1048] In some countries, such as India, [1049] Bangladesh, [1050] and Ethiopia, [1051]  journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic. [1052]  Misinformation has been propagated by celebrities, politicians [1053] [1054] (including heads of state in countries such as the United States, [1055] [1056] Iran, [1057] and Brazil [1058] [1059] ), and other prominent public figures. [1060] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and ""miracle"" cures . [1061] [1062] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus. [1063] [1064] [1065] Some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory, [1066] [1067] a population-control scheme, the result of a spy operation , [1031] [1032] [1068] or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks. [1069]  The World Health Organization has declared an ""infodemic"" of incorrect information about the virus, which poses risks to global health.

Some locations, including North Korea , have yet to report cases.   ^  United States Figures include cases identified on the Grand Princess . Figures do not include the unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands, all of which are listed separately. Not all states or overseas territories report recovery data. Cases include clinically diagnosed cases as per CDC guidelines. [33] Recoveries and deaths include probable deaths and people released from quarantine as per CDC guidelines. [34] [35] [36] Figures from the United States Department of Defense are only released on a branch-by branch basis since April 2020, without distinction between domestic and foreign deployment, and cases may be reported to local health authorities. [37] Cases for the USS Theodore Roosevelt , currently docked at Guam, are reported separate from national figures but included in the Navy's totals. There is also one case reported from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base not included in any other nation or territory's counts. [38] Since April 2020, the United States Department of Defense has directed all bases, including Guantanamo Bay, to not publicize case statistics. [37]   ^  Brazil Since 6 June, the Brazilian government has ordered the Ministry of Health to stop reporting the total number of deaths and active cases. [40] [41] After this, the National Council of Health Secretaries assumed the function of reporting the total number of deaths and active cases. [42]   ^  Russia Including cases from the disputed  Crimea and Sevastopol . Excluding the cases from Diamond Princess cruise ship which are classified as ""on an international conveyance"".   ^  Chile  Including the special territory of Easter Island . The Chilean Ministry of Health considered all cases as a ""recovered"" after 14 days since the initial symptoms of the virus, no matter the health situation of the infected or if following tests indicate the continuing presence of the virus. The only exception were casualties, which are not included as recovered. [49] Deaths only include cases with positive PCR tests and catalogued as ""COVID-19 related death"" by the Civil Registry and Identification Service . This number is informed on the daily reports of the Ministry of Health. A report with the total number of deaths, including suspected cases without PCR test, is released weekly since 20 June 2020. [50] In the latest report (28 June 2020), the number of total deaths is 8,935. [51]   ^  United Kingdom Excluding all British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies .

The MS Rotterdam rendezvoused with the Zaandam on 26 March off the coast of Panama City to provide support and evacuate healthy passengers. Both have since docked in Florida. [309] [310] MS Zaandam and Rotterdam 's numbers are currently not counted in any national figures.   ^  Coral Princess The cruise ship Coral Princess has tested positive cases since early April 2020 and has since docked in Miami. [313] Coral Princess 's numbers are currently not counted in any national figures.   ^  HNLMS Dolfijn  All 8 cases currently associated with Dolfijn were reported while the submarine was at sea in the waters between Scotland and the Netherlands. [319] It is unclear whether the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is including these cases in their total count, but neither their daily update details nor their daily epidemiological situation reports appear to have mentioned the ship, with a breakdown of cases listing the twelve provinces of the country of the Netherlands (as opposed to the kingdom ) accounting for all the cases in the total count. [320] [321]   ^  Figures for Tanzania are for 29 April as the country stopped publishing figures on coronavirus cases on that date. [328] Figures as of that date were 509 cases, 21 deaths, and 183 recoveries. [329] [330]    References    ^ a  b  ""Naming the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus that causes it"" .

Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs

Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.

Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic.[80]

Finance of business

Business finance measures include:[81]

Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.

Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]

Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.

Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe, PPK)

Healthcare

Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.

Enhancing financial market soundness

Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee.[83]

Public investment plan

Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.

The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas. [79]   Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs  Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.  One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.  The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.  Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]  Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.  Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe , PPK)  Healthcare  Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.  Enhancing financial market soundness  Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee. [83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[14]  According to the NBP , 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016. [15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013). [5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months. [16]  The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period. [4]  About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka , [17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018. [18]   Refugees [ edit ]  Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine , including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""), [19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme. [20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation, [21] [22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power. [21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.

City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Place in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland

Zielona Góra [ʑeˈlɔna ˈɡura] () (German: Grünberg in Schlesien) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 141,222 inhabitants (2019).[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski. Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe[2] and Warsaw with Berlin.[3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest.[4]

History [ edit ]

The city's history began when Polish Duke Henry the Bearded brought first settlers to the area in 1222.[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945.[4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles, most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands.

The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I.[5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce.[5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded.[5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302.[6]

Panorama of city in mid-18th century

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung.[7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.[6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.[8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG, an early form of the German name Grünberg.[8]

In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze, is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron.[9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.[9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506,[10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508.[11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland.[12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights.[11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking.[13]

Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.[14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.[14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.[9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.[5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.[5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.[11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.[11]

The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration,[14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747;[14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city.[11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.[14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English.[11]

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages,[5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.[5] A Polish church remained functional[5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;[15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established.[15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.[15]

Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.[14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.[16] The city was first connected to the Glogau-Grünberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911.[14]

Local museum

In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.[11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań, intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war.[10]

The Soviet Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II.[14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide.[17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled, and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945,[18] before the historic Polish[19] name Zielona Góra was restored.[20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak,[11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland, remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.[21]

From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.[11]

The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów.

Geography [ edit ]

Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills and the adjacent woodland alone makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German.[2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"".[24]

Wineries [ edit ]

The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż (Paradise) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).

Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.

Climate [ edit ]

The climate is oceanic (Köppen: Cfb) with some humid continental characteristics (Dfb) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.[25]

[1] Zielona Góra has been in Lubusz Voivodeship since 1999, prior to which it was the capital of Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1950 to 1998. It is the seat of the province's elected assembly , while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is located in the city of Gorzów Wielkopolski . Zielona Góra has a favourable geographical position, being located not far from the Polish-German border and on several international road and rail routes connecting Scandinavia with Southern Europe [2] and Warsaw with Berlin . [3] The region is also closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest .

[4] In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted town privileges . The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506. As part of Bohemia, in 1526 it became part of the Habsburg Empire and experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War , the city was annexed by Prussia and, in 1871, became part of Germany, until the end of World War II in 1945. [4] In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , the province was handed over to Poland and resettled with Poles , most of whom came from Central Poland, but some also had been expelled from the Eastern Borderlands . The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I . [5] The oldest settlement was agricultural and later developed into a trading point along routes from Poznań to Żagań and further to Łużyce . [5] The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded . [5] Other documents date the settlement to 1302. [6]    Panorama of city in mid-18th century   Timber-framed Catholic church  The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung . [7] The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht , a variation of Magdeburg rights , in 1323. [6] The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. [8] A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toruń) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name GRVNINBERG , an early form of the German name Grünberg . [8]  In 1294, Duke Henryk III of Głogów , founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig , patron saint of Silesia. This building, today called the konkatedra św. Jadwigi w Zielonej Górze , is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of Ścinawa from 1358 to 1365; Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron . [9] In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke John II of Żagań , destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it. [9] The deposition of Duke John II of Żagań in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old , before it was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, [10] although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city only in 1508. [11] The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout Poland . [12] In 1641, King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. [11] Another important branch of the city's economy was winemaking . [13]    The original marketplace with historical tenement houses spared from destruction during World War II  Grünberg converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. [14] The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. [14] In 1651 during the Counter Reformation , the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism . [9] The city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. [5] A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. [5] Also at that time, from 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665. [11] As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft. [11]  The city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War . The Prussians introduced religious toleration , [14] leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church Zum Garten Christ from 1746 to 1747; [14] Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War , POWs brought the plague epidemic to the city. [11] The city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 18th century, and by 1800 large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. [14] The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire . The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland . Among the 19th-century industrialists of Zielona Góra there were also the English . [11]    Concert Hall  During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, [5] although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. [5] A Polish church remained functional [5] until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association ( Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników ) was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; [15] it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo . In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. [15] In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school. [15]  Since 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars , Grünberg was administered within the district Landkreis Grünberg in the Province of Silesia . In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany . English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. [14] By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. [16] The city was first connected to the Glogau -Grünberg- Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt in 1904, Wollstein in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau in 1911. [14]    Local museum  In 1919, Grünberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany . On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city, but this status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany . During the Kristallnacht in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue. [11] During World War II the Germans established a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , 11 forced labour camps and 4 labour units of the POW camp in Żagań , intended for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war. [10]  The Soviet  Red Army occupied Grünberg with little fighting on February 14, 1945 during World War II. [14] In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. [17] The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement , the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union . The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled , and the town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . The city was briefly renamed Zielonogóra in 1945, [18] before the historic Polish [19] name Zielona Góra was restored. [20] The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church ( Kościół Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej ). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, [11] prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland , remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans. [21]  From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. [11]  The University of Zielona Góra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów .

The name of the city itself translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German . [2] Moreover, Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements , palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra a nickname ""The City of Wine"". [24]   Wineries [ edit ]  The city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia ). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Paradyż ( Paradise ) Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual Wine Festival has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s). Vodka Luksusowa (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra.   Panorama of the city from the vineyards  Climate [ edit ] The climate is oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) with some humid continental characteristics ( Dfb ) in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.

Division of Poland into powiats (counties)

A powiat (pronounced [ˈpɔvʲjat]; Polish plural: powiaty) is the second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1, formerly NUTS-4) in other countries. The term ""powiat"" is most often translated into English as ""county"" or ""district"".

A powiat is part of a larger unit, the voivodeship (Polish województwo) or province.

A powiat is usually subdivided into gminas (in English, often referred to as ""communes"" or ""municipalities""). Major towns and cities, however, function as separate counties in their own right, without subdivision into gminas. They are termed ""city counties"" (powiaty grodzkie or, more formally, miasta na prawach powiatu) and have roughly the same status as former county boroughs in the UK. The other type of powiats are termed ""land counties"" (powiaty ziemskie).

As of 2018, there were 380 powiat-level entities: 314 land counties, and 66 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see ""List of Polish counties"". For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the individual voivodeships (e.g., Greater Poland Voivodeship).

History [ edit ]

The history of Polish powiats goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic unit of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's partitioning in 1795.

In the 19th century, the powiats continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland"")—the equivalent of the Russian ""uyezd"" and the Ukrainian ""povit""—and, in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań, as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"".

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the powiats were again the second-level territorial units.

Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodeships, but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger voivodeships.

Functioning [ edit ]

Legislative power within a powiat is vested in an elected council (rada powiatu), while local executive power is vested in an executive board (zarząd powiatu) headed by the starosta, elected by the council. The administrative offices headed by the starosta are called the starostwo. However, in city counties these institutions do not exist separately – their powers and functions are exercised by the city council (rada miasta), the directly elected mayor (burmistrz or prezydent), and the city offices (urząd miasta).

In some cases a powiat has its seat outside its own territory. For example, Poznań County (powiat poznański) has its offices in Poznań, although Poznań is itself a city county, and is therefore not part of Poznań County.

Powiats have relatively limited powers, since many local and regional matters are dealt with either at gmina or voivodeship level. Some of the main areas in which the powiat authorities have decision-making powers and competences include:

education at high-school level (primary and middle schools are run by the gminas)

healthcare (at county level)

public transport

maintenance of certain designated roads

land surveying

issuing of work permits to foreigners

vehicle registration (see Polish car number plates).

Names and English equivalents [ edit ]

The Polish the name of a county, in the administrative sense, consists of the word powiat followed by a masculine-gender adjective (because powiat is a masculine noun). In most cases, this is the adjective formed from the name of the town or city where the county has its seat. Thus the county with its seat at the town of Kutno is named powiat kutnowski (Kutno County). (In modern Polish both parts of the name are written in lower case; however, names of powiats in the Grand Duchy of Poznań were written in upper case.) If the name of the seat comprises a noun followed by an adjective, as in Maków Mazowiecki (""Mazovian Maków""), the adjective will generally be formed from the noun only (powiat makowski). There are also a few counties whose names are derived from the names of two towns (such as powiat czarnkowsko-trzcianecki, Czarnków-Trzcianka County), from the name of a city and a geographical adjective (powiat łódzki wschodni, Łódź East County), or a mountain range (powiat tatrzański, Tatra County).

There is more than one way to render such names into English. A common method is to translate the names as ""(something County)"", as in the examples above. (This system is the standard used in Wikipedia.) Thus in most cases the English name for a powiat consists of the name of the city or town which is its seat, followed by the word County.

Note that different counties sometimes have the same name in Polish, since the names of different towns may have the same derived adjective. For example, the counties with their seats at Grodzisk Wielkopolski and Grodzisk Mazowiecki are both called powiat grodziski, and those with seats at Brzeg and Brzesko are both called powiat brzeski. In English this ambiguity either does not occur (Brzeg County and Brzesko County) or can be avoided by using the complete name of the seat (Grodzisk Wielkopolski County and Grodzisk Mazowiecki County).
