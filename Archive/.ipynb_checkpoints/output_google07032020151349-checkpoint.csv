Per capita map of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland

The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[11][12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[13][14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields, surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers.[16]

As of 25 June 2020 , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases,[4] 1,412 deaths,[6] and 18,654 recoveries.[5]

Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events,[17][18][19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel.[20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders.[21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (U07.1[22]).[23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 (U07.2)[22]) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH.[7] As of 28 March 2020 , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2.[8] As of 29 March 2020 , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing.[24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation, requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes.[25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.[26]

Background [ edit ]

Predictions of a pandemic were made repeatedly in the early twenty-first century, prior to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken.[28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks.[29][30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan.[31]

Preparations [ edit ]

Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).

During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China.[32]

Testing and monitoring [ edit ]

COVID-19 monitoring in Poland [33] ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures.

As of 29 February 2020 , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[34]

On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing.[35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[36]

New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]

A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[37] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[38] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[37] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[40]

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]

On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services.[41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services.[12] Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days.[12]

On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results,[42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.[43]

The first lab-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was announced on 4 March 2020, out of 584 tests in total.[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka. He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra, where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive.[35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy.[3]

On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases:[45] one hospitalised in Ostróda, linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK).[36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed.[46]

On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz (Silesian Voivodeship). Both were in good condition.[47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw, Wrocław and Racibórz: one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young.[48][49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław) was in serious condition.[50]

On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz, one in Kraków, one in Wrocław and one in Poznań, bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17.[51]

10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]

On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission.[13][14]

The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19.[52] Armed Forces General Commander gen. Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March.[53]

On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [pl].[54]

On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered.[55][56]

28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]

On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec, ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness.[57]

One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.[58]

On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw, were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.[59]

Epidemic controls [ edit ]

Lockdown type measures [ edit ]

Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings.[17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020.[18]

All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020.[19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura, the exam during the final year of secondary school (liceum or technikum), remained unchanged.[60]

Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes.[61]

An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki.[44]

On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church, funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive.[20][62]

As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland, to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation.[63][64]

On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) (Polish: rozporządzenie), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules.[65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government.[25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars.[66][65]

The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice.[25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14)[26][67] 1 person per 10 m2.[68][69]

On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places.[70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable.[71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April.[72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński[73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions.[74]

SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]

As of 20 March 2020 , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union, the EFTA and the European Economic Area, and above that of Croatia and Hungary.[75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection.[76]

Medical supplies [ edit ]

On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion.[16] OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination.[16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.[77]

Impact [ edit ]

Economy [ edit ]

The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries.[78]

Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]

The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" (Polish: Tarcza antykryzysowa). The program was launched on 1 April 2020.[78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.[79]

Financial safety of employees and protection of jobs

Government-paid social insurance contributions for three months, for companies employing up to nine people, self-employed individuals and freelancers.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.

Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic.[80]

Finance of business

Business finance measures include:[81]

Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

The taxpayers affected by pandemic are entitled to deduct their losses incurred in 2020 from income obtained in 2019 providing that revenue has diminished by more than 50%.

Non-repayable loans up to 5,000 PLN for companies employing up to 9 people, but there cannot be any lay-offs within the next 6 months. [82]

Enabling legally the company credit-worthiness assessing on the basis of former year financial statement in order to extend the repayment terms of business overdrafts.

Postponing the deadlines of withholding taxes, submitting the fiscal declarations and implementation of mandatory Employee Pension Plan (EPP, pol. Pracownicze Plany Kapitałowe, PPK)

Healthcare

Enabling the taxpayers to deduct their donations given for counteracting the pandemic from their income.

Enhancing financial market soundness

Reducing banks' capital buffers requirements by Financial Stability Committee.[83]

Public investment plan

Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.

The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.

Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]

Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations.[84][85][86]

The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino, produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin, and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020.[84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy.[87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals.[88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland.[89][90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid.[91]

A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management.[92][93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi, near the demarcation line with South Ossetia.[94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine.[95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast, including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine.[96]

The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren.[97][98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program, spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals.[99]

The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg, Breisgau, organized help and emergency counselling,[100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes,[86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes.[101]

The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU).[85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries.[102]

Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]

On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital[103] by Marek Wierzba. He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired.[104]

On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [pl], sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl]. Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community.[105]

A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL, described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"".[21]

On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy.[103]

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]

After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship, bordering Germany,[3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020,[106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships. On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie.[107][108]

On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days.[33]

Additional information [ edit ]

COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]

On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system.[23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2, which had been defined by WHO one day earlier[7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"",[22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions.[7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka, interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.[109][110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.[7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2. On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.[9]

Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]

On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse.[8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [pl] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests.[8] As of 6 April 2020 , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests.[9]

Unofficial deaths [ edit ]

There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.[111]

OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria[112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.[113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.[112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.[114]

Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.[115] Gazeta Pomorska [pl] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 , according to Gazeta Pomorska, the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.[116]

In February and March 2020, health authorities in Poland carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 , one of the seven known human coronaviruses , as well as home quarantining and monitoring. [11] [12] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra , with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020. [2] [3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March. [13] [14] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March. [15] Polish authorities did not participate in the 28 February 2020 European Union tender procedure for purchasing COVID-19 pandemic related medical equipment, in which 20 other member states participated. Poland applied on 6 March for the 17 March tender for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face shields , surgical masks and protective clothing; the European Commission stated that all requests in the tender were satisfied by offers. [16]  As of 25 June 2020 [update] , there were 33,119 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, [4] 1,412 deaths, [6] and 18,654 recoveries. [5]  Lockdown-type control measures started on 10–12 March, closing schools and university classes and cancelling mass events, [17] [18] [19] and were strengthened on 25 March, limiting non-family gatherings to two people and religious gatherings to six and forbidding non-essential travel. [20] On 20 March, the Ministry of Health tried to prevent medical personnel from commenting on the pandemic. The Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar defended medical personnel's right to speak publicly about the epidemic on constitutional grounds of freedom of speech and the right of the public to information. Doctors opposed the self-censorship orders. [21] Fatality counts initially only included deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( U07.1 [22] ). [23] Starting on 1 April 2020, fatalities that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 ( U07.2 ) [22] ) were also considered as COVID-19 deaths by NIPH–NIH . [7] As of 28 March 2020 [update] , people in Poland who died in quarantine from suspected COVID-19 were not tested post mortem for SARS-CoV-2. [8] As of 29 March 2020 [update] , there were 269,307 people under quarantine for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 42,783 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been made since the beginning of testing. [24] The lockdown restrictions were tightened starting on 31 March–1 April by a government regulation , requiring individuals walking in streets to be separated by two metres, closing parks, boulevards, beaches, hairdressers and beauty salons, and forbidding unaccompanied minors from exiting their homes. [25] A followup regulation on 10 April loosened the restrictions on public gatherings starting from 20 April, allowing religious gatherings and funerals to be held for up to a maximum of 50 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank warned about the risk of pandemics throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, especially after the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak . [27] The WHO coined the term Disease X in 2018, so that preparations for the next, at-the-time unknown, pandemic could be undertaken. [28] In 2005–2006, prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic , and during the decade following the pandemic, governments in the United States and France prepared stocks of pandemic protective items and then depleted these stocks. [29] [30] In late December 2019 and early January 2020, an outbreak of infections from a virus, which was found to be closely related to the SARS virus, rapidly expanded in Wuhan in China, prior to spreading elsewhere around the world, with the first COVID-19 death being officially reported on 11 January 2020 in Wuhan. [31]   Preparations [ edit ]   Medical tents in front of a hospital in Włocławek for examining patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (March 2020).  During January 2020, Warsaw Chopin Airport carried out special screening measures for passengers arriving from China. [32]   Testing and monitoring [ edit ]    COVID-19 monitoring in Poland     ""Suspected"" means hospitalised for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of updates, data from earlier dates are repeated without change. Early values of lab-tested counts are shown as ""1"" in the absence of data. Quarantine numbers from 17 March include people quarantined after entering Poland following border closures. [33]   As of 29 February 2020 [update] , four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw . Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories. [34]  On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing ( NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn , Wrocław , Poznań , Katowice , Rzeszów , Gdańsk and Kielce ), [3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories were carrying out the testing. [35] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin , Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day. [3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests. [36]   New law: ""specustawa"" [ edit ]  A new law (nicknamed Polish : specustawa , [37] lit. special law ) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm , on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading. [38]  Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure. [39] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [ pl ] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS . Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed. [37]  Ewa Łętowska [ pl ] , a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal , also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency , in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.

Pre-4 March 2020 [ edit ]  On 19 February, twelve people remained hospitalised ""in connection with the coronavirus"", 13 were under home quarantine and 1000 were being monitored by health services. [41] On 27 February 47 people remained hospitalised with suspicions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55 were under home quarantine and 1570 were being monitored by health services. [12] Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated on 27 February that he expected positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed cases in the following days. [12]  On 3 March, a total of 559 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been run for people in Poland suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with negative results, [42] while the numbers of people home quarantined and monitored increased and the number of hospitalised, suspected cases dropped.

[3] The patient, a 66-year-old man, returned from a visit to Westphalia in Germany by bus to Świecko and from there by private car to Cybinka . He telephoned a general practitioner. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Zielona Góra , where he arrived around midday 2 March. In the evening of 2 March, a sample from the patient was sent for analysis to Warsaw. The result was known to be positive during the night of 3 to 4 March, and announced by the Minister of Health at 8:00 local time on 4 March. OKO.press criticised the delay of 44 hours from the patient's arrival at the hospital to the announcement of the positive test result as excessive. [35] Close contacts of the patient were home quarantined. The Minister of Health requested the media to respect the patient's privacy. [3]  On 6 March, Polish Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of four new cases: [45] one hospitalised in Ostróda , linked to ""patient zero"" from Cybinka (the two had travelled in the same bus); two patients in Szczecin who had returned by car from Italy; and one patient in Wrocław who had returned from the United Kingdom (UK). [36] On 7 March, another SARS-CoV-2 case, of another person who had travelled in the bus together with ""patient-zero"", was announced by the Minister of Health as lab-confirmed. [46]  On 8 March, The Ministry of Health reported two new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One person was hospitalised in Warsaw and another in Racibórz ( Silesian Voivodeship ). Both were in good condition. [47] In the evening, the Ministry confirmed another three positive test results, increasing the daily case count to five new cases. The patients were hospitalised in Warsaw , Wrocław and Racibórz : one elderly person, one middle-aged and one young. [48] [49] The elderly person (hospitalised in Wrocław ) was in serious condition. [50]  On 9 March, in the morning, Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski announced the confirmation of five new cases. Three cases were confirmed in Racibórz , one in Kraków , one in Wrocław and one in Poznań , bringing the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Poland to 17. [51]   10 March–27 March: local transmission [ edit ]  On 10 March, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Poland was officially declared to the World Health Organization as having shifted from imported cases only to local transmission . [13] [14]  The eighteenth confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced in the Masovian Voivodeship on 10 March. The two SARS-CoV-2 patients earlier announced in Warsaw were both seriously ill with COVID-19. [52]  Armed Forces General Commander  gen.  Jarosław Mika was diagnosed with the virus on 10 March. [53]  On 16 March, the number of confirmed cases increased to 177 and the death toll to 4. One of those infected was Minister of the Environment Michał Woś [ pl ] . [54]  On 17 March, ""patient zero"", at Zielona Góra hospital, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the second time, and was considered to have recovered. [55] [56]   28 March–1 April: nursing home and hospital clusters [ edit ]  On 17 March, a doctor at a hospital in Grójec , ""Z."", had a dry cough and fever and had a sample taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing. While several members of staff did not want to work with him, the head of their group disagreed but decided after a long debate to isolate Z. The hospital continued to function for the rest of the day without disinfection of the places where Z. had been present. On 18 March Z. was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and the hospital took samples from close contacts of Z. from the previous five days. Some of the nurses were ordered back to work at the hospital while waiting for their test results. As of 24 March, 11 of the 59 patients of the hospital and seven medical personnel were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Onet.pl and Gazeta Wyborcza described the situation as contagion by carelessness. [57]  One of the Grójec hospital personnel also worked at a Niedabyl nursing home. On 28 March, 52 of the 66 residents and eight employees were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. [58]  On 1 April, 38 hospitals and hospital sections around Poland, including twelve in the Masovian Voivodeship that includes the Polish capital of Warsaw , were temporarily closed due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination from a confirmed or likely SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. [59]   Epidemic controls [ edit ]   Hand sanitiser distributor in an almost empty shopping centre in Tomaszów Mazowiecki , 3 March 2020  Lockdown type measures [ edit ]  Polish authorities' initial COVID-19 limitation strategy of laboratory testing, contact tracing, quarantining and monitoring intensified in mid-March with ""lockdown"" type measures. On 10 March, authorities cancelled all mass events, defined as those allowing 1000 or more participants in the case of stadiums or other events outside of buildings, and those allowing 500 or more participants in the case of events in buildings. [17] Cultural institutions, such as philharmonic orchestras, operas, theatres, museums, and cinemas, had their activities suspended beginning on 12 March 2020. [18]  All schools in Poland were closed starting on 12 March, with a reopening initially scheduled for 25 March 2020. [19] The closure was extended to 10 April, with schools being required to carry out online classes with their students. As of 20 March, the dates of final exams for eighth (final) year of primary school and matura , the exam during the final year of secondary school ( liceum or technikum ), remained unchanged. [60]  Universities cancelled classes for the same period, while typically keeping research and administrative staff at work and allowing exceptions for research purposes. [61]  An official epidemic was declared in Poland on 20 March 2020 by the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki . [44]  On 24 March, Poland's government announced further restrictions on people leaving their homes and on public gatherings to further limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The new limits constrained gatherings by default to a maximum of two people (with an exception for families); an exception for religious gatherings, such as mass in the Catholic Church , funerals and marriages in which five participants and the person conducting the ceremony were allowed to gather; and an exception for work places. Non-essential travel was prohibited, with the exception of travelling to work or home, SARS-CoV-2 control related activities, or ""necessary everyday activities"". Everyday activities qualifying as ""necessary"" included shopping, buying medicines, visiting doctors, walking dogs, jogging, cycling and walking, provided that no more than two people participate and contact with others was avoided. The restrictions were initially defined for the period from 25 March to 11 April inclusive. [20] [62]  As of 12 March 2020, the National Bank of Poland , to which commercial banks in Poland send their bank notes to, carried out a two-week quarantine procedure and heating at 150 °C (302 °F) for all bank notes, prior to returning the notes for circulation. [63] [64]  On 31 March, the prime minister announced that Poland would strengthen the restrictions starting from 31 March–1 April. Lawyers contacted by OKO.press expected the restrictions to be issued as a regulation (secondary legislation) ( Polish : rozporządzenie ), which they considered would be an unconstitutional method of introducing the rules. [65] The regulation was published in Dziennik Ustaw on 31 March 2020 as a regulation issued by the government. [25] According to the regulation, minors (aged under 18) were prohibited from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Parks, boulevards and beaches were closed, as well as all hairdressers, beauty parlours and tattoo and piercing salons. Hotels were allowed to operate only if they had residents in quarantine, in another form of isolation, on an obligatory work delegation for services such as building construction or medical purposes. Individuals walking in public were obliged to be separated by at least two metres, with the exception of guardians of children under 13 and disabled persons. No restrictions were applied to people travelling in private cars. [66] [65]  The 31 March regulation allowed religious (Article 9.3a) and other (Article 15.1, 15.2) gatherings of only five people plus a religious personnel or funeral employees from 1 to 11 April. The gatherings were allowed to be bigger, up to 50 people, inclusive of religious personnel, to start from 12 April 2020 until further notice. [25] An updated regulation on 10 April retained the authorisation of religious/funeral gatherings of up to 50 people but shifted the start date to 20 April (Article 9.2) while other gatherings remained banned (Article 14) [26] [67] 1 person per 10 m 2 . [68] [69]  On 9 April, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the closure of educational institutions and international transport would continue to 26 April, the borders would remain ""closed"" until 3 May, and people entering Poland would still be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Szumowski stated that the closure of cultural institutions and limits implemented in shops would continue to 19 April. A new control measure was planned to start from 16 April, making it obligatory to cover one's nose and mouth in public places. [70] After being asked where people could obtain masks from, Szumowski clarified that any form of face covering, such as scarves, would be acceptable. [71] A government website differed from the 31 March regulation, stating that religious gatherings were to be limited to at most five people until 19 April. [72] Police stated that the 10 April gathering of the de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński [73] and nine other people, standing close together, commemorating the Smolensk air disaster by laying a wreath, did not constitute a gathering in the sense of big gatherings forbidden in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former prime minister of Poland Leszek Miller described the gathering as showing contempt for ordinary people respecting the COVID-19 restrictions. [74]   SARS-CoV-2 tests [ edit ]  As of 20 March 2020 [update] , the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per capita in Poland was lower than that of 22 other members of the European Union , the EFTA and the European Economic Area , and above that of Croatia and Hungary. [75] Among 19 mostly European countries analysed by OKO.press using data from 20 March, the number of tests per positive detection was 30.8 tests per positive detection in Poland, higher than for any of the other European countries listed, including Germany (28.7) and Norway (28.1), and lower than in South Korea at 36.6 and Russia at 721 tests per positive detection. [76]   Medical supplies [ edit ]  On 26 March, the Minister of Health Łukasz Szumowski claimed that European solidarity in the provision of medical equipment to Poland had failed. OKO.press qualified the claim as ""false"" and accused the minister of deliberately misleading public opinion. [16]  OKO.press referred to the European Union (EU) tender process for masks and other protective equipment as a ""success"" that Poland applied for very late, and commented as context that the EU does not have the legal powers to impose health management policy, such as quarantine measures or closing schools, on member states. The EU tender process was announced on 28 February 2020, to which 20 member states, without Poland, responded. Poland joined the mechanism on 6 March, qualifying for a procedure opened on 17 March for the purchase of gloves, goggles, face protectors, surgical masks and clothing. The European Commission claimed that all the purchases were satisfied by offers, and should arrive within two weeks. Commissioner Thierry Breton described the procedure as illustrating the power of EU coordination. [16] On 19 March, the EU announced the creation of the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment, to be financed at the level of 90% by the Commission, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. [77]   Impact [ edit ]  Economy [ edit ]  The pandemic and the isolation measures in response to it had a serious influence on the Polish economy, especially commerce, tourism and the hospitality industries . [78]   Anti-crisis Shield [ edit ]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose . You can help by converting this section , if appropriate. Editing help is available.  ( April 2020 )  The government prepared a plan of public assistance to businesses, called the ""Anti-crisis Shield"" ( Polish : Tarcza antykryzysowa ). The program was launched on 1 April 2020. [78] The program consists primarily of the following five areas.

One-off benefits of circa 2,000 PLN gross (80% of the monthly minimal wage) for self-employed and freelancers. Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be eligible for these benefits.  Working permits for non-citizens are to be prolonged to 30 days after the official revoking of the state of epidemic (as of early April 2020, a formal state of emergency or state of natural disaster had not been declared), if they expire during the state of epidemic . [80]  Finance of business  Business finance measures include: [81]   Public co-financing of employees' salaries up to 40% of the average monthly wage, if working time has been reduced up to 20%, but no less than working time for a part-time position.

[83]  Public investment plan  Elongated deadlines of public projects and cancellation of deadlines penalties in public tenders.  The public purchases for equipment needed in counteracting the pandemic no longer has to conform the public procurement law.  Solidarity with other countries [ edit ]  Polish authorities and citizens took several solidarity actions to support people in other countries affected by the pandemic and to help in repatriations. [84] [85] [86]  The Polish government sent medical supplies to Italy and San Marino, including 20,000 litres of disinfectants to Veneto and San Marino , produced by the state-owned Polfa Tarchomin , and a load of medical supplies on 7 April 2020. [84] The Polish Centre for International Aid sent a team of 15 Polish doctors and paramedics to a field hospital in Brescia, Lombardy . [87] Doctors from WIM Warszawa share their Italian COVID-19 experience with Armenian, Azeri and Moldovan colleagues. Polish farmers allocated some of their production to Italian doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. [88] The Italian flag was shown as an illumination on many buildings in Poland. [89] [90] Polish authorities sent Spain 20,000 litres of Trisept Complex disinfectant liquid. [91]  A medical mission from Warsaw's Military Institute of Medicine went to Chicago on 23 April 2020 to help in COVID-19 management. [92] [93] On 13 April 2020, the Representation of Solidarity Fund PL in Georgia provided spraying equipment, 500 visors and 800 reusable face masks to municipal authorities in Rustavi and Marneuli (Lower Kartli), Gori (Inner Kartli) and to a clinic in Nikozi , near the demarcation line with South Ossetia . [94] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated 1.2 million PLN to projects aimed at supporting emergency services in Georgia and Ukraine. [95] A convoy of the Polish State Fire Service carrying humanitarian cargo for the National Medical Response Center arrived in Minsk in Belarus on 24 April, for medical institutions in Grodno Oblast , including 50,000 litres of disinfectant, 30,000 litres of antiseptic, 100,000 surgical masks and chloroquine . [96]  The Polish company Wipasz donated 100,000 reusable protective masks to Kazakhstan, laptops for Kazakhstani schoolchildren. [97] [98] A team of Polish eight doctors, nurses and paramedics from Polish Center of International Aid participated in the World Health Organization support program , spending a ten-day mission training staff in Kyrgyz hospitals . [99]  The Polish community participated in grassroots solidarity actions around the world. Volunteers of the Polish Catholic Mission in Freiburg , Breisgau , organized help and emergency counselling, [100] teachers from Polish schools in the Czech Republic sewed masks and provided them to senior peoples' homes, [86] the Polish community in Canada printed 3D protective materials and helped in shopping, the Polish Medical Association from Berdyansk in Ukraine organized telephone consultations, the Association of Poles in Spain nasz Dom – Nuetra casa provided legal and psychological support and sewed protective clothing for nursing homes. [101]  The Polish airline LOT used Twitter to organise a ""#LOTdoDomu"" (""#aFLIGHTHome"") return program of 2,000 people to their countries of origin, including 18 other member states of the European Union (EU). [85] The programme was completed on 5 April 2020. LOT also organised 388 special charter flights over 22 days which brought 55,000 Polish citizens and workers to Poland. Polish authorities offered ferry and dedicated train services, and 18 convoys of 800 vehicles, escorted by police, to help Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to return to their countries. [102]   Censorship of medical personnel [ edit ]  On 18 March 2020, an experienced midwife in a Lesser Poland Voivodeship hospital published a report on Facebook on the conditions of medical personnel and the situation of the hospital in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 March, she was fired from the hospital [103] by Marek Wierzba . He stated that medical staff should be responsible, reliable and should publish true information. He also stated that the dismissed midwife had been spreading panic. Polish Minister of Health  Łukasz Szumowski stated that she shouldn't have been fired. [104]  On 20 March, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, Józefa Szczurek-Żelazko [ pl ] , sent a written statement ordering voivodeship medical consultants to not make statements about SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological situation, the risks for medical staff or methods of protection from infection, unless they had first consulted with the Ministry of Health or Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] . Szczurek-Żelazko motivated the order by the need to provide correct, unified information and to avoid unjustified unrest in the medical community. [105]  A surgeons group, Porozumienie Chirurgów SKALPEL , described the order as blackmail and said that it risked catastrophe. The group stated that the COVID-19 pandemic showed Poland as ""not at all prepared for crisis situations"" with a ""lack of equipment, basic personal protective gear and disinfectant materials and a lack of standards and procedures"". [21]  On 25 March 2020, the Polish Ombudsman  Adam Bodnar sent a letter to the Minister of Health, Szumowski, stating that medical staff's freedom of speech and is guaranteed under Articles 2 and 54 of the Polish Constitution and the right of the public to information is guaranteed under Article 61 of the constitution. Bodnar stated that firing or punishing doctors for informing the public during the pandemic could be a violation of the ""obligatory standards"". Bodnar asked if Szumowski was aware of the situation and requested a clarification of policy. [103]   Spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and around Poland [ edit ]  This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  ( April 2020 )   Temporary German–Polish border control at Lubieszyn (Western Pomerania) [ pl ] , 15 March 2020.    SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: cumulative     Cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 lab-confirmed cases in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU ( DE  CZ  SK  LT ): shades of green; non-EU ( RU  BY  UA ): shades of blue.     SARS-CoV-2 spread in Poland and its neighbours: daily     Daily spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland compared with that of Poland's seven terrestrial neighbours. Poland: red; EU : shades of green; non-EU: shades of blue. Values of zero are shown as ""1"".   After the first laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case in Poland on 4 March 2020, in Lubusz Voivodeship , bordering Germany, [3] cases were confirmed in seven other voivodeships throughout Poland during 5–9 March 2020, [106] covering eight of the sixteen voivodeships . On 17 March, all sixteen voivodeships had recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, with the final two voivodeships being Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Podlaskie . [107] [108]  On 15 March, Poland closed its land borders for 10 days, and international airports for 14 days for passenger traffic, only allowing Polish residents, citizens and those with immediate Polish family to enter Poland. People entering Poland were required to be quarantined for 14 days. [33]    Additional information [ edit ]  See also: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland  COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 death classification [ edit ]  On 26 March 2020, the Polish health authorities' classification of COVID-19 deaths only included deaths of people with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, classified as U07.1 under the ICD-10 international disease classification system. [23] COVID-19 deaths under U07.2 , which had been defined by WHO one day earlier [7] to mean deaths when ""COVID-19 is diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available"", [22] were not yet included in the NIPH–NIH instructions. [7] Stefan Karczmarewicz, writing in Polityka , interpreted this as an attempt by authorities to lower the official COVID-19 death toll in Poland. He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category U07.2 implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll. [109] [110] NIPH–NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the U07.2 definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases. [7] NIPH–NIH stated that the WHO considered it ""irrelevant"" to distinguish between U07.1 and U07.2 . On 6 April, Bartosz Fiałek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH–NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that U07.2 was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine. [9]   Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine [ edit ]  On 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in Głogów after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police. As of 26 March 2020, the prosecutor investigating his death had not decided whether or not to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test on the corpse. [8] The dead body of a 50-year-old woman who returned from Germany to Konin and felt ill was found by her family on 24 March. Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny [ pl ] (GIS, the national health agency) refused to test the corpse for SARS-CoV-2. As of 27 March 2020 [update] , GIS had not stated what procedures were in place for post mortem tests. [8] As of 6 April 2020 [update] , it was not known if any laboratories in Poland were qualified to carry out post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 tests. [9]   Unofficial deaths [ edit ]  There were several claims of COVID-19 deaths unreported by the Ministry of Health. In early April, Warsaw City Council stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski , stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight. [111]  OKO.press claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a Ministry of Interior and Administration hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria [112] and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health. [113] On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced. [112] On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw. [114]  Disagreement between local media, the head of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship , and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a Grudziądz hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudziądz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive. [115]  Gazeta Pomorska [ pl ] stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper ""intervened"". As of 8 April 2020 [update] , according to Gazeta Pomorska , the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudziądz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudziądz in their reports.

Voivodeship in Poland

Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province[3] (Polish: województwo śląskie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ˈɕlɔ̃skʲɛ]; German: Woiwodschaft Schlesien; Czech: Slezské vojvodství) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia (Górny Śląsk), with Katowice serving as its capital.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.

The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants.[4] It is also the largest urbanised area in Central and Eastern Europe.[5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.[5][6][7]

History [ edit ]

For the first time Silesian Voivodeship was appointed in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which ended up in the Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

After aggression of Nazi Germany (Invasion of Poland), on 8 October 1939, Hitler published a decree ""About division and administration of Eastern Territories"". A Silesian Province (Gau Schlesien) was created, with a seat in Breslau (Wrocław). It consisted of four districts: Kattowitz, Oppeln, Breslau and Liegnitz.

The following counties were included in Kattowitz District: Kattowitz, Königshütte, Tarnowitz, Beuthen Hindenburg, Gleiwitz, Freistadt, Teschen, Biala, Bielitz, Saybusch, Pleß, Sosnowitz, Bendzin and parts of the following counties: Kranau, Olkusch, Riebnich and Wadowitz. However, according to Hitler's decree from 12 October 1939 about establishing General Government (Generalgouvernement), Tschenstochau (Częstochowa) belonged to GG.

In 1941 the Silesian Province (Provinz Schlesien) underwent new administrative division and as a result Upper Silesian Province was created (Provinz Oberschlesien):

Kattowitz District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz) – entire Silesian Voivodeship without Lubinitz county, Bendzin County, part of Olkusch county, Biala county, Saybusch and parts of Kranau and Wadowitz counties.

Oppeln District (Regierungsbezirk Oppeln) – Lubinitz county and parts of Tschenstochau and Warthenau counties.

After the War during 1945–1950 there existed a Silesian Voivodeship, commonly known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship, which included a major part of today's Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian Voivodeship.

The present Silesian Voivodeship was formed in 1999 from the following voivodeships of the previous administrative division:

Katowice Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Bielsk Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Częstochowa Voivodeship excluding some gminas and powiats

Geography [ edit ]

The Silesian Voivodeship borders both the Moravian-Silesian Region (Czech Republic), Žilina Region (Slovakia) to the south. It is also bordered by four other Polish voivodeships: those of Opole (to the west), Łódź (to the north), Świętokrzyskie (to the north-east), and Lesser Poland (to the east).

The region includes the Silesian Upland (Wyżyna Śląska) in the centre and north-west, and the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland (Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska) in the north-east. The southern border is formed by the Beskidy Mountains (Beskid Śląski and Beskid Żywiecki).

The current administrative unit of Silesian Voivodeship is just a fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz Voivodeship. On the other hand, a large part of the current administrative unit of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).

Demography [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship has the highest population density in the country (379 people per square kilometre, compared to the national average of 124). The region's considerable industrialisation gives it the lowest unemployment rate nationally (6.2%). The Silesian region is the most industrialized and the most urbanized region in Poland: 78% of its population live in towns and cities.

Tourism [ edit ]

Both northern and southern part of the voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa – the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Oder River are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.

With its more than two centuries of industrialisation history, region has a number of technical heritage memorials. These include narrow and standard gauge railways, coal and silver mines, shafts and its equipment from 19th and 20th century.

Cities and towns [ edit ]

Katowice is the capital of the Silesian Voivodeship

Bielsko-Biała is a major industrial, transport and touristic hub

Due to its industrial and urban nature, the voivodeship has many cities and large towns. Of Poland's 40 most-populous cities, 12 are in Silesian Voivodeship. 19 of the cities in the voivodeship have the legal status of city-county (see powiat). In all it has 71 cities and towns (with legal city rights), listed below in descending order of population (as of 2019):[1]

Economy [ edit ]

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 61 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland.[8]

The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) and the Rybnik Coal District (Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy) with its major cities Rybnik, Jastrzębie Zdrój, Żory and Wodzisław Śląski. Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom, Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa. The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.[9]

Transport [ edit ]

Katowice International Airport (in Tarnowskie Góry County) is used for domestic and international flights, Other Nearby Airports are John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice and Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. The Silesian agglomeration railway network has the largest concentration in the country. The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk (motorway A1) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków (motorway A4), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw. It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Wrocław, Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans. A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS, English: Broad gauge metallurgy line) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Education [ edit ]

There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice, with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University, The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, the University of Music in Katowice, the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned. Bielsko-Biała is home of the Technical-Humanistic Academy. In addition, 17 new private schools have been established in the region.

There are over 300,000 people currently studying in the Voivodeship.

Politics [ edit ]

Silesian Regional Assembly

The Silesian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.

The Sejmik of Silesia consists of 48 members.

2018 election [ edit ]

Administrative division [ edit ]

Silesian Voivodeship is divided into 36 counties (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far more than any other voivodeship) and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.

Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz , Lower Silesian , and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland . The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice , Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała  Voivodeships , pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It is the most densely populated voivodeship in Poland and within the area of 12,300 square kilometres, there are almost 5 million inhabitants. [4] It is also the  largest urbanised  area in Central and Eastern Europe . [5] In relation to economy, over 13% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated here, making the Silesian Voivodeship one of the wealthiest provinces in the country.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 € or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. Silesia Voivodship is the province with the fourth highest GDP per capita in Poland. [8]  The Silesian voivodship is predominantly an industrial region. Most of the
mining is derived from one of the world's largest bituminous coalfields of the Upper Silesian Industrial District ( Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy ) and the Rybnik Coal District ( Rybnicki Okręg Węglowy ) with its major cities Rybnik , Jastrzębie Zdrój , Żory and Wodzisław Śląski . Lead and zinc can be found near Bytom , Zawiercie and Tarnowskie Góry ; iron ore and raw materials for building – near Częstochowa . The most important regional industries are: mining, iron, lead and zinc metallurgy, power industry, engineering, automobile, chemical, building materials and textile. In the past, the Silesian economy was determined by coal mining. Now, considering the investment volume, car manufacturing is becoming more and more important. The most profitable company in the region is Fiat Auto-Poland S.A. in Bielsko-Biała with a revenue of PLN 6.2 billion in 1997. Recently a new car factory has been opened by GM  Opel in Gliwice. There are two Special Economic Zones in the area: Katowice and Częstochowa. The voivodship's economy consists of about 323,000, mostly small and medium-sized, enterprises employing over 3 million people. The biggest Polish steel-works ""Huta Katowice"" is situated in Dąbrowa Górnicza . The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.

The voivodship capital enjoys good railway and road connections with Gdańsk ( motorway A1 ) and Ostrava (motorway A1), Kraków ( motorway A4 ), Wrocław (motorway A4), Łódź (motorway A1) and Warsaw . It is also the crossing point for many international routes like E40 connecting Calais , Brussels , Cologne , Dresden , Wrocław , Kraków and Kiev and E75 from Scandinavia to the Balkans . A relatively short distance to Vienna facilitates cross-border co-operation and may positively influence the process of European integration. Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym LHS , English: Broad gauge metallurgy line ) in Sławków is the longest broad gauge  railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost 400 km from the Polish- Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów . It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Education [ edit ]  There are eleven public universities in the voivodship. The biggest university is the University of Silesia in Katowice , with 43,000 students. The region's capital boasts the Medical University , The Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice , the University of Music in Katowice , the Physical Education Academy and the Academy of Fine Arts. Częstochowa is the seat of the Częstochowa University of Technology and Pedagogic University. The Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice is nationally renowned.

History, and trends [ edit ]

Since World War II [ edit ]

After the quashing of a Ukrainian insurrection at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union, about 140,000 Ukrainians residing within the new Polish borders were forcibly moved to northern and western Poland during Operation Vistula, settling the former Recovered Territories ceded to Poland at the Tehran Conference of 1943.

The total of 27,172 people declared Ukrainian nationality in the Polish census of 2002. Most of them lived in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (11,881), followed by West Pomeranian (3,703), Podkarpackie (2,984) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (2,831).[7] Some Lemkos (recognized in Poland as distinct ethnic group) regard themselves as members of the Ukrainian nation, while others distance themselves from Ukrainians.[7]

Economic migration [ edit ]

Since 1989, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a new wave of Ukrainian immigration, mostly of job seekers, tradesmen, and vendors, concentrated in larger cities with established market. After the Poland's 2004 accession to the European Union, in order to meet the requirements of the Schengen zone (an area of free movement within the EU), the government was forced to make immigration to Poland more difficult for the people from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, Ukrainians consistently receive the most settlement permits and the most temporary residence permits in Poland (see table).[9] As a result of the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km of the border. Up to 1.5 million people would benefit from this agreement which took effect on July 1, 2009.[10] In 2017 the visa requirements were finally abolished for short stays of up to 90 days.[11]

After 2014, more Ukrainians from eastern Ukraine, more men, and more younger Ukrainians have been working in Poland.[12]

The overwhelming majority of applications for temporary residence are being accepted. Resulting from this, Ukrainians constituted 25% of the entire immigrant population of Poland in 2015.[13]

In January 2016 the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw informed that the number of Ukrainian residents in Poland was half a million, and probably around one million in total. Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, noted that Ukrainian professionals enjoy good reputation in Poland and in spite of their growing numbers Polish-Ukrainian relations remain very good.[14]

According to the NBP, 1.2 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2016.[15] 1.7 million short-term work registrations were issued to them in 2017 (an eightfold increase compared to 2013).[5] Ukrainian workers stay in Poland on average 3–4 months.[16]

The number of permanent residence permits increased from 5,375 in 2010 to 33,624 (14 September 2018), while the number of temporary residence permits increased from 7,415 to 132,099 over the same time period.[4]

About 102,000 Ukrainian citizens received Karta Polaka,[17] of whom some 15,500 obtained permanent residence permits in the period from 2014 to March 2018.[18]

Refugees [ edit ]

Following the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, including its illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea (""Helsinki Declaration""),[19] the situation changed dramatically. Poland began taking in large numbers of refugees from the Ukraine conflict as part of the EU's refugee programme.[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation,[21][22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power.[21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.[13]

[20] The policy of strategic partnership between Kyiv and Warsaw was extended to military and technical cooperation, [21] [22] but the more immediate task, informed Poland's State secretary Krzysztof Szczerski, was the Ukraine's constitutional reform leading to broad decentralization of power. [21] The number of applications for refugee status rose 50 times following the start of War in Donbass in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. However, most new applicants are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Poland, because Ukraine is a sovereign country with a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens. Resident visas in Poland are available in other immigration categories.

Ukraiński Świat jest ostatnią deską ratunku dla uciekających przed przemocą na Ukrainie do Polski, a także dla tych, którzy po powrocie do domu narażeni są na problemy gospodarcze. Raport, opublikowany 21 lipca przez Urząd do Spraw Cudzoziemców w Polsce pokazuje 50-krotny wzrost ukraińskich wniosków o status uchodźcy. Od 2013 do 2014 roku wnioski o pobyt czasowy wzrosły dwukrotnie, z 13,000 do 29,000. Wskaźnik ten cały czas rośnie: w ciągu pierwszych siedmiu miesięcy 2015 roku wyniósł ponad 32,000.
