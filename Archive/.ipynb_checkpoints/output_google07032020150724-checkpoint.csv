1,it is (more risky|riskier) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/how-risky-flying-during-coronavirus-pandemic,"WASHINGTON - How risky is flying during the coronavirus pandemic?



Flying can increase your risk of exposure to infection, but airlines are taking some precautions and you can too.



Air travel means spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which puts you into close contact with other people. As travel slowly recovers, planes are becoming more crowded, which means you will likely sit close to other people, often for hours, which raises your risk.



Once on a plane, most viruses and other germs don't spread easily because of the way air circulates, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Airlines also say they are focusing on sanitizing the hard surfaces that passengers commonly touch.



Some airlines like Alaska, Delta, JetBlue and Southwest are blocking middle seats or limiting capacity. But even if every middle seat is empty you will likely be closer than the recommended distance of 6 feet to another passenger now that planes are getting fuller.



American, United and Spirit are now booking flights to full capacity when they can. All leading U.S. airlines require passengers to wear masks. Lauren Ancel Meyers, an expert in disease outbreaks at the University of Texas, says that can help limit risk.



For air travel, and all other types of transportation, the CDC recommends washing your hands, maintaining social distancing and wearing face coverings.



Several airlines announced Monday that they will ask passengers about possible COVID-19 symptoms and whether they have been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus in the previous two weeks.



Still, Meyers said you still might consider whether you need to be on that plane. ""We should all be in the mindset of 'only if necessary' and always taking the most precautions we can to protect ourselves and others,"" she said.","        Skip to main content           Open main navigation           Live TV            Full Schedule   All Programs          Live Radio                 Full Schedule   All Programs          United States      US Politics    Immigration    All About America      Science & Health    Silicon Valley & Technology        World      Africa    The Americas    East Asia Pacific    Europe      Extremism Watch    Middle East    South & Central Asia    VOA News on Iran        Sections      Arts & Culture    Day in Photos    Economy & Business    Press Freedom      Plugged in with Greta Van Susteren    VOA StudentU    VOA Connect    Refugees              FEATURED  US News  Press Freedom  VOA News on Iran  COVID-19 Pandemic  Editorials          Search       Search VOA News     Search         Lang     Live TV           Live TV            Full Schedule   All Programs          Live Radio          Live Radio                 Full Schedule   All Programs                  English   English  voanews.com    Learning English  learningenglish.voanews.com     Eastern & Central Europe   Shqip  zeriamerikes.com    Bosanski  ba.voanews.com    Ελληνικά  gr.voanews.com    Македонски  mk.voanews.com    Srpski  glasamerike.net    Українська  ukrainian.voanews.com     Eurasia   Հայերեն  amerikayidzayn.com    Azerbaijani  amerikaninsesi.org    ქართული  amerikiskhma.com    Русский  golos-ameriki.ru     Central Asia   O‘zbek‎  amerikaovozi.com     South Asia   বাংলা  voabangla.com    دری  darivoa.com    پښتو  pashtovoa.com    وی او اې ډيوه ريډیو  voadeewanews.com    ارد  urduvoa.com     East & Southeast Asia   ျမန္မာ  burmese.voanews.com    粤语  voacantonese.com    中文  voachinese.com    Bahasa Indonesia  voaindonesia.com    ខ្មែរ  khmer.voanews.com    Khmer  voacambodia.com    한국어  voakorea.com    ລາວ  lao.voanews.com    ไทย  voathai.com    བོད་ཡིག  voatibetan.com    Tiếng Việt  voatiengviet.com     Africa   Afaan Oromoo  voaafaanoromoo.com    አማርኛ  amharic.voanews.com    Bambara  voabambara.com    Français  voaafrique.com    Hausa  voahausa.com    Kinyarwanda / Kirundi  radiyoyacuvoa.com    Ndebele  voandebele.com    Português  voaportugues.com    Shona  voashona.com    Soomaaliga  voasomali.com    Kiswahili  voaswahili.com    ትግርኛ  tigrigna.voanews.com    Zimbabwe  voazimbabwe.com     Middle East/North Africa   فارسی  ir.voanews.com    كوردی  dengiamerika.com    Kurdi  dengeamerika.com    Türkçe  amerikaninsesi.com     Latin America   Creole  voanouvel.com    Español  voanoticias.com                Share on Facebook    Share on Twitter    Share via Email    Print this page       COVID-19 Pandemic  How Risky Is Flying During Coronavirus Pandemic?

We spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky and which you should try to avoid.

Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said.

Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said.

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.

While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly.

Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly. Here&apos;s what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country.               High risk: Gatherings of family or friends           People at a pool party.  Shutterstock/Jacob Lund    Getting together with family or friends who don&apos;t live in your household comes with a high risk of infection, Hassig said. ""If you haven&apos;t been living with them, then there&apos;s a potential risk,"" she said. Family and friends are unlikely to wear masks or social distance at these gatherings, and asymptomatic people could spread the virus there. If you do decide to get together with family or friends, you should consider the age and underlying conditions of the people there and those you live with. You should also consider who your friends could have come into contact with. Are they mostly staying at home? Are they visiting different friends every day? ""It&apos;s not just your friend"" you&apos;re seeing, Hassig said — ""it&apos;s everybody they&apos;ve spent time with.""           High risk: Bars           People toast the reopening of the Friends and Neighbors bar in Appleton, Wisconsin, following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Gov. Tony Evers' safer-at-home order on May 13.  William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS    Bars ""should not be allowed to open,"" Hassig said. The nature of bars — mingling, crowded bartops, and the inability to wear a mask while you&apos;re drinking — make them a high-risk place for getting a coronavirus infection, Hassig said. And alcohol can hinder decision-making, which could make those factors even worse.           High risk: Religious functions           People wearing face masks attend a service at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea, on May 10.  Associated Press    Rituals like shaking hands and taking communion in the Catholic Church, as well as dense crowds and the prevalence of older people, make religious services a high-risk place for coronavirus infections. The risk could be lowered by social distancing, wearing masks, and abstaining from rituals that involve touching, eating, or drinking.           High risk: Movie theaters and sporting events           A Regency Theatre.  Kevork Djansezian/Reuters    Movie theaters or large events like sporting games have a high risk especially because of the crowding at entries and exits. Even if attendees can enter and exit while social distancing — which would likely be complicated and take longer — getting infected while sitting in a contained area is still a risk.           Medium to high risk: Gyms           A person exercising at a Gold's Gym that reopened in Georgia.  Maranie Staab/Reuters    Gymgoers should wear a mask when possible, Hassig said. Equipment should be sanitized before and after each use, and social distancing should be enforced rigorously.           Medium risk: Restaurants (indoors)           Servers wearing gloves and masks get takeout orders from the kitchen at a restaurant in Houston, Texas, on May 1.  MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images    Indoor dining at restaurants is risky because of airflow and people being in an enclosed space for hours at a time. To help mitigate the risks of eating in a restaurant, people should wear masks until their food is delivered. Disposable materials, especially for things like menus, can also help.           Medium risk: Hair and nail salons           A man washes a customer's hair at a hair salon in Atlanta on April 27.  Jessica McGowan/Getty Images    Hair and nail salons, which have opened in several states, have a medium risk of infection, Hassig said. Wearing masks is critical, as it helps block particles from spreading as easily when you&apos;re speaking or coughing. It also discourages employees and customers from touching their faces. Salon employees should be sure to wash their hands frequently, Hassig said.           Medium risk: Dates or gatherings with a couple of friends           Two people eating.  David Mercado/Reuters    When it comes to dates or gatherings with a very small group, the same questions apply as with larger group gatherings. Geography also matters: In an area with a lot of cases, like New York, the risk that your date could be contagious is higher than in a suburb with only a handful of cases.           Low to medium risk: Beaches           A man rides his bike on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu in April.  Caleb Jones/AP Photo    Social distancing on beaches can help lower the risk of catching the coronavirus while you&apos;re enjoying a day in the sun. But it can also be hard to enforce because of the size of many beaches — they usually have many points of entry, so it would be difficult to limit capacity.           Low risk: Outdoor dining           A restaurant's outdoor dining area.  Sam Greenwood/Getty Images    Dining outdoors at a restaurant is a relatively low-risk activity as long as tables are kept at least 6 feet apart. Being outside allows air to flow more freely. You should still wear a mask as often as you can and be cautious of high-touch items like menus and condiments.           Low risk: Outdoor activities           A person hiking in Glacier National Park.  Galyna Andrushko/Shutterstock    When you&apos;re on a hike or a walk in the park, you shouldn&apos;t worry too much about quickly walking past another person on a path or trail. While you should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all times, encounters of more than 15 minutes are riskier than walking past someone. Outdoor activities are low risk if you stay with people from your household. If you meet up with other friends or family, that still counts as a gathering, and proper precautions should be taken.           Low risk: Shopping           A worker adjusting a sign at a Walmart.   Joe Raedle/Getty Images)     Shopping in a grocery store or a clothing store can be low risk if you keep a distance from others and wear a mask. Fitting rooms should be closed, or if people are allowed to try on clothes, anything that isn&apos;t purchased should be quarantined for a couple of days, Hassig said. The place in stores with the most risk is the checkout, where interactions with cashiers or other customers could help spread the virus.           Low risk: Touching mail or groceries           A United States Postal Service worker delivering mail in Philadelphia on April 2.  Associated Press    There&apos;s a low risk of catching the coronavirus from touching your mail or other items like groceries. Hassig said she doesn&apos;t wipe down her groceries — but if you&apos;re worried about it, you can keep nonperishable items in the grocery bag for a few days before using them. You should still be cautious about touching things like doorknobs and elevator buttons.           Something is loading.

Since 31 December 2019 and as of 9 June 2020, 7 069 278 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including 405 587 deaths. EU/EEA countries and the UK reported 1 444 710 cases (20% of all cases), including 169 207 deaths (42% of all deaths).

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to EU/EEA countries and the UK and to countries worldwide, many of which have been experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several months. While decreasing trends in disease incidence are being observed in the EU/EEA and the UK overall, some Member States are still reporting community transmission. In addition, the information available from sero-epidemiological studies suggests that the adaptive immunity of populations remains low.

The absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, combined with an exponential growth in infections from late February, led many countries to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as ‘stay-at-home’ policies, alongside other community and physical distancing measures, such as the cancellation of mass gatherings, and the closure of educational institutions, work places and public spaces. This approach has collectively reduced transmission and, as of 9 June 2020, the 14-day incidence in the EU/EEA and the UK overall has declined by 80% since the peak on 9 April. The initial wave of transmission has passed its peak in all countries apart from Poland and Sweden.

Although these stringent physical distancing measures have reduced transmission, they are highly disruptive to society, both economically and socially. All countries that had implemented enforced ‘stay-at-home’ orders for the general population have initiated full or partial relaxation of these measures, and several have begun a full or partial re-opening of small retail shops and other public spaces. At the present time, just before the summer holiday period, as Member States relax limitations, there is a risk that people will not adhere firmly to the recommended measures still in place due to ‘isolation fatigue’. Therefore, continuous efforts are needed to ensure that the remaining physical distancing and infection prevention control measures continue be observed to limit the spread of the disease. The pandemic is not over, and hypothetical forecasting indicates a rise in cases is likely in the coming weeks.

At this stage, the following measures are essential to maintain a reduced level of transmission and avoid resurgence:

A robust monitoring framework to closely monitor the epidemiological situation, rapidly detect increased transmission, assess the impact of the interventions in place and avoid a resurgence of COVID-19

An expanded testing strategy aiming for comprehensive testing of all individuals displaying symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In particular, a systematic or more comprehensive testing approach is suggested in high-risk populations or settings. It is suggested that testing should be ramped up and tests made easily and quickly available to all individuals displaying symptoms compatible with COVID-19, including those with mild symptoms. Member States should also consider implementing PCR-based prevalence studies and sero-epidemiological studies to monitor the spread of disease.

A framework for contact tracing, based on extensive testing, active case finding, early detection of cases, isolation of cases, quarantine and follow-up of contacts, possibly supported by electronic tools and applications.

Long-term sustainable implementation of essential non-pharmaceutical interventions, irrespective of transmission rates, and the ability to amend strategies rapidly in response to indications of increased transmission. Reinstatement or introduction of further measures could be considered at local or regional level, or for specific population groups, depending on transmission patterns. Protection of the most vulnerable and at-risk populations is of paramount importance as they have suffered most of the burden from this pandemic in terms of morbidity, mortality and need for healthcare.

A strong risk communication strategy should remind citizens that the pandemic is far from over. People need to be aware that the public health measures to limit the spread of the virus will continue to impact the way we move, work and travel, and our leisure activities for the foreseeable future. This is especially important as Europe moves towards the summer holidays, when changes in people’s behaviour, activities and movements may cause people to switch back to pre-pandemic and potentially risky behaviour patterns. Four key risk communication messages are proposed: This is a marathon, not a sprint. We must not drop our guard. We all need to adjust to a ‘new normal’. Together, our actions give us the power to control the spread of the virus.

1,it is (more risky|riskier) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52849691,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People sunbathing on the beach by Bournemouth pier as lockdown eases

Relaxing lockdown is a risk because levels of the coronavirus are still ""very high"", one of the government's top science advisers says.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait.

The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings.

One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.

'Little time for stringent measures'

""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.

Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases.

They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase.

Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus.

But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.

The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports.

Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over.

However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"".

The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick.

This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Behavioural scientists advising government ""strongly recommend"" monitoring how well people were keeping to the rules.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours.

The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective.

'Taking a risk'

However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster.

Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here.""

And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day.

Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate.

The documents also showed:

On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""

The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.

Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts

In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""

The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings

Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""

The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk

Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""

Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms

Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1

Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.

""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence.""
