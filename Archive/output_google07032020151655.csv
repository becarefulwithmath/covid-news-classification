1,it is (more risky|riskier) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/how-risky-flying-during-coronavirus-pandemic,"WASHINGTON - How risky is flying during the coronavirus pandemic?



Flying can increase your risk of exposure to infection, but airlines are taking some precautions and you can too.



Air travel means spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which puts you into close contact with other people. As travel slowly recovers, planes are becoming more crowded, which means you will likely sit close to other people, often for hours, which raises your risk.



Once on a plane, most viruses and other germs don't spread easily because of the way air circulates, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Airlines also say they are focusing on sanitizing the hard surfaces that passengers commonly touch.



Some airlines like Alaska, Delta, JetBlue and Southwest are blocking middle seats or limiting capacity. But even if every middle seat is empty you will likely be closer than the recommended distance of 6 feet to another passenger now that planes are getting fuller.



American, United and Spirit are now booking flights to full capacity when they can. All leading U.S. airlines require passengers to wear masks. Lauren Ancel Meyers, an expert in disease outbreaks at the University of Texas, says that can help limit risk.



For air travel, and all other types of transportation, the CDC recommends washing your hands, maintaining social distancing and wearing face coverings.



Several airlines announced Monday that they will ask passengers about possible COVID-19 symptoms and whether they have been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus in the previous two weeks.



Still, Meyers said you still might consider whether you need to be on that plane. ""We should all be in the mindset of 'only if necessary' and always taking the most precautions we can to protect ourselves and others,"" she said.","        Skip to main content           Open main navigation           Live TV            Full Schedule   All Programs          Live Radio                 Full Schedule   All Programs          United States      US Politics    Immigration    All About America      Science & Health    Silicon Valley & Technology        World      Africa    The Americas    East Asia Pacific    Europe      Extremism Watch    Middle East    South & Central Asia    VOA News on Iran        Sections      Arts & Culture    Day in Photos    Economy & Business    Press Freedom      Plugged in with Greta Van Susteren    VOA StudentU    VOA Connect    Refugees              FEATURED  US News  Press Freedom  VOA News on Iran  COVID-19 Pandemic  Editorials          Search       Search VOA News     Search         Lang     Live TV           Live TV            Full Schedule   All Programs          Live Radio          Live Radio                 Full Schedule   All Programs                  English   English  voanews.com    Learning English  learningenglish.voanews.com     Eastern & Central Europe   Shqip  zeriamerikes.com    Bosanski  ba.voanews.com    Ελληνικά  gr.voanews.com    Македонски  mk.voanews.com    Srpski  glasamerike.net    Українська  ukrainian.voanews.com     Eurasia   Հայերեն  amerikayidzayn.com    Azerbaijani  amerikaninsesi.org    ქართული  amerikiskhma.com    Русский  golos-ameriki.ru     Central Asia   O‘zbek‎  amerikaovozi.com     South Asia   বাংলা  voabangla.com    دری  darivoa.com    پښتو  pashtovoa.com    وی او اې ډيوه ريډیو  voadeewanews.com    ارد  urduvoa.com     East & Southeast Asia   ျမန္မာ  burmese.voanews.com    粤语  voacantonese.com    中文  voachinese.com    Bahasa Indonesia  voaindonesia.com    ខ្មែរ  khmer.voanews.com    Khmer  voacambodia.com    한국어  voakorea.com    ລາວ  lao.voanews.com    ไทย  voathai.com    བོད་ཡིག  voatibetan.com    Tiếng Việt  voatiengviet.com     Africa   Afaan Oromoo  voaafaanoromoo.com    አማርኛ  amharic.voanews.com    Bambara  voabambara.com    Français  voaafrique.com    Hausa  voahausa.com    Kinyarwanda / Kirundi  radiyoyacuvoa.com    Ndebele  voandebele.com    Português  voaportugues.com    Shona  voashona.com    Soomaaliga  voasomali.com    Kiswahili  voaswahili.com    ትግርኛ  tigrigna.voanews.com    Zimbabwe  voazimbabwe.com     Middle East/North Africa   فارسی  ir.voanews.com    كوردی  dengiamerika.com    Kurdi  dengeamerika.com    Türkçe  amerikaninsesi.com     Latin America   Creole  voanouvel.com    Español  voanoticias.com                Share on Facebook    Share on Twitter    Share via Email    Print this page       COVID-19 Pandemic  How Risky Is Flying During Coronavirus Pandemic?

We spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky and which you should try to avoid.

Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said.

Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said.

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School professor, recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence-only approach won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

So we spoke with Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risks of going out to eat, gathering with friends, and opening mail.

While different activities are, by nature, riskier than others, you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others. Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly.

Things like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly. Here&apos;s what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country.               High risk: Gatherings of family or friends           People at a pool party.  Shutterstock/Jacob Lund    Getting together with family or friends who don&apos;t live in your household comes with a high risk of infection, Hassig said. ""If you haven&apos;t been living with them, then there&apos;s a potential risk,"" she said. Family and friends are unlikely to wear masks or social distance at these gatherings, and asymptomatic people could spread the virus there. If you do decide to get together with family or friends, you should consider the age and underlying conditions of the people there and those you live with. You should also consider who your friends could have come into contact with. Are they mostly staying at home? Are they visiting different friends every day? ""It&apos;s not just your friend"" you&apos;re seeing, Hassig said — ""it&apos;s everybody they&apos;ve spent time with.""           High risk: Bars           People toast the reopening of the Friends and Neighbors bar in Appleton, Wisconsin, following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Gov. Tony Evers' safer-at-home order on May 13.  William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS    Bars ""should not be allowed to open,"" Hassig said. The nature of bars — mingling, crowded bartops, and the inability to wear a mask while you&apos;re drinking — make them a high-risk place for getting a coronavirus infection, Hassig said. And alcohol can hinder decision-making, which could make those factors even worse.           High risk: Religious functions           People wearing face masks attend a service at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea, on May 10.  Associated Press    Rituals like shaking hands and taking communion in the Catholic Church, as well as dense crowds and the prevalence of older people, make religious services a high-risk place for coronavirus infections. The risk could be lowered by social distancing, wearing masks, and abstaining from rituals that involve touching, eating, or drinking.           High risk: Movie theaters and sporting events           A Regency Theatre.  Kevork Djansezian/Reuters    Movie theaters or large events like sporting games have a high risk especially because of the crowding at entries and exits. Even if attendees can enter and exit while social distancing — which would likely be complicated and take longer — getting infected while sitting in a contained area is still a risk.           Medium to high risk: Gyms           A person exercising at a Gold's Gym that reopened in Georgia.  Maranie Staab/Reuters    Gymgoers should wear a mask when possible, Hassig said. Equipment should be sanitized before and after each use, and social distancing should be enforced rigorously.           Medium risk: Restaurants (indoors)           Servers wearing gloves and masks get takeout orders from the kitchen at a restaurant in Houston, Texas, on May 1.  MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images    Indoor dining at restaurants is risky because of airflow and people being in an enclosed space for hours at a time. To help mitigate the risks of eating in a restaurant, people should wear masks until their food is delivered. Disposable materials, especially for things like menus, can also help.           Medium risk: Hair and nail salons           A man washes a customer's hair at a hair salon in Atlanta on April 27.  Jessica McGowan/Getty Images    Hair and nail salons, which have opened in several states, have a medium risk of infection, Hassig said. Wearing masks is critical, as it helps block particles from spreading as easily when you&apos;re speaking or coughing. It also discourages employees and customers from touching their faces. Salon employees should be sure to wash their hands frequently, Hassig said.           Medium risk: Dates or gatherings with a couple of friends           Two people eating.  David Mercado/Reuters    When it comes to dates or gatherings with a very small group, the same questions apply as with larger group gatherings. Geography also matters: In an area with a lot of cases, like New York, the risk that your date could be contagious is higher than in a suburb with only a handful of cases.           Low to medium risk: Beaches           A man rides his bike on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu in April.  Caleb Jones/AP Photo    Social distancing on beaches can help lower the risk of catching the coronavirus while you&apos;re enjoying a day in the sun. But it can also be hard to enforce because of the size of many beaches — they usually have many points of entry, so it would be difficult to limit capacity.           Low risk: Outdoor dining           A restaurant's outdoor dining area.  Sam Greenwood/Getty Images    Dining outdoors at a restaurant is a relatively low-risk activity as long as tables are kept at least 6 feet apart. Being outside allows air to flow more freely. You should still wear a mask as often as you can and be cautious of high-touch items like menus and condiments.           Low risk: Outdoor activities           A person hiking in Glacier National Park.  Galyna Andrushko/Shutterstock    When you&apos;re on a hike or a walk in the park, you shouldn&apos;t worry too much about quickly walking past another person on a path or trail. While you should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all times, encounters of more than 15 minutes are riskier than walking past someone. Outdoor activities are low risk if you stay with people from your household. If you meet up with other friends or family, that still counts as a gathering, and proper precautions should be taken.           Low risk: Shopping           A worker adjusting a sign at a Walmart.   Joe Raedle/Getty Images)     Shopping in a grocery store or a clothing store can be low risk if you keep a distance from others and wear a mask. Fitting rooms should be closed, or if people are allowed to try on clothes, anything that isn&apos;t purchased should be quarantined for a couple of days, Hassig said. The place in stores with the most risk is the checkout, where interactions with cashiers or other customers could help spread the virus.           Low risk: Touching mail or groceries           A United States Postal Service worker delivering mail in Philadelphia on April 2.  Associated Press    There&apos;s a low risk of catching the coronavirus from touching your mail or other items like groceries. Hassig said she doesn&apos;t wipe down her groceries — but if you&apos;re worried about it, you can keep nonperishable items in the grocery bag for a few days before using them. You should still be cautious about touching things like doorknobs and elevator buttons.           Something is loading.

Since 31 December 2019 and as of 9 June 2020, 7 069 278 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including 405 587 deaths. EU/EEA countries and the UK reported 1 444 710 cases (20% of all cases), including 169 207 deaths (42% of all deaths).

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to EU/EEA countries and the UK and to countries worldwide, many of which have been experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several months. While decreasing trends in disease incidence are being observed in the EU/EEA and the UK overall, some Member States are still reporting community transmission. In addition, the information available from sero-epidemiological studies suggests that the adaptive immunity of populations remains low.

The absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, combined with an exponential growth in infections from late February, led many countries to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as ‘stay-at-home’ policies, alongside other community and physical distancing measures, such as the cancellation of mass gatherings, and the closure of educational institutions, work places and public spaces. This approach has collectively reduced transmission and, as of 9 June 2020, the 14-day incidence in the EU/EEA and the UK overall has declined by 80% since the peak on 9 April. The initial wave of transmission has passed its peak in all countries apart from Poland and Sweden.

Although these stringent physical distancing measures have reduced transmission, they are highly disruptive to society, both economically and socially. All countries that had implemented enforced ‘stay-at-home’ orders for the general population have initiated full or partial relaxation of these measures, and several have begun a full or partial re-opening of small retail shops and other public spaces. At the present time, just before the summer holiday period, as Member States relax limitations, there is a risk that people will not adhere firmly to the recommended measures still in place due to ‘isolation fatigue’. Therefore, continuous efforts are needed to ensure that the remaining physical distancing and infection prevention control measures continue be observed to limit the spread of the disease. The pandemic is not over, and hypothetical forecasting indicates a rise in cases is likely in the coming weeks.

At this stage, the following measures are essential to maintain a reduced level of transmission and avoid resurgence:

A robust monitoring framework to closely monitor the epidemiological situation, rapidly detect increased transmission, assess the impact of the interventions in place and avoid a resurgence of COVID-19

An expanded testing strategy aiming for comprehensive testing of all individuals displaying symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In particular, a systematic or more comprehensive testing approach is suggested in high-risk populations or settings. It is suggested that testing should be ramped up and tests made easily and quickly available to all individuals displaying symptoms compatible with COVID-19, including those with mild symptoms. Member States should also consider implementing PCR-based prevalence studies and sero-epidemiological studies to monitor the spread of disease.

A framework for contact tracing, based on extensive testing, active case finding, early detection of cases, isolation of cases, quarantine and follow-up of contacts, possibly supported by electronic tools and applications.

Long-term sustainable implementation of essential non-pharmaceutical interventions, irrespective of transmission rates, and the ability to amend strategies rapidly in response to indications of increased transmission. Reinstatement or introduction of further measures could be considered at local or regional level, or for specific population groups, depending on transmission patterns. Protection of the most vulnerable and at-risk populations is of paramount importance as they have suffered most of the burden from this pandemic in terms of morbidity, mortality and need for healthcare.

A strong risk communication strategy should remind citizens that the pandemic is far from over. People need to be aware that the public health measures to limit the spread of the virus will continue to impact the way we move, work and travel, and our leisure activities for the foreseeable future. This is especially important as Europe moves towards the summer holidays, when changes in people’s behaviour, activities and movements may cause people to switch back to pre-pandemic and potentially risky behaviour patterns. Four key risk communication messages are proposed: This is a marathon, not a sprint. We must not drop our guard. We all need to adjust to a ‘new normal’. Together, our actions give us the power to control the spread of the virus.

1,it is (more risky|riskier) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52849691,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People sunbathing on the beach by Bournemouth pier as lockdown eases

Relaxing lockdown is a risk because levels of the coronavirus are still ""very high"", one of the government's top science advisers says.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait.

The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings.

One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.

'Little time for stringent measures'

""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.

Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases.

They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase.

Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus.

But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.

The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports.

Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over.

However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"".

The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick.

This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Behavioural scientists advising government ""strongly recommend"" monitoring how well people were keeping to the rules.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours.

The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective.

'Taking a risk'

However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster.

Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here.""

And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day.

Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate.

The documents also showed:

On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""

The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.

Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts

In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""

The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings

Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""

The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk

Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""

Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms

Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1

Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.

""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence.""

As we venture out again to enjoy summer activities, many of you have submitted questions asking about the risk of COVID-19 during various activities. You want to know: What types of situations should be avoided? Is it safe to take my child to dance class? What preventive measures can be taken?

We're happy to see these questions, because it's important to not let your guard down.

""Even if you are seeing more people out, you still need to be cautious and take the virus seriously,"" says Sara H. Bares, MD, Nebraska Medicine infectious diseases specialist. ""And remember that you do not have to have symptoms to transmit the virus.""

Those at higher risk should certainly be more cautious, but young and otherwise healthy individuals can get sick too. We should all act responsibly to avoid putting others in harm's way.

Here are seven ways to recognize risky situations:

1. You're finding it hard to stay 6 feet away from others.

A safe situation is one where you can maintain 6 feet of space between yourself and people you don't live with. Droplets produced by talking, coughing or sneezing generally carry approximately 6 feet.

2. People aren't wearing masks.

Masks serve two purposes:

They protect you from exposure

They also prevent you spreading the virus to others if you are asymptomatic or presymptomatic

Any two or three-ply cotton mask that covers the nose and mouth will work. Wash your hands before you put on your mask and after you take off your mask. If you wear a reusable mask, wash it regularly.

If you are returning to work in a shared office space, wearing a mask is a good idea. If you are working in a private office, it's okay to take off the mask when you're alone in your office. Just be sure to wear it when using common spaces like bathrooms, hallways and breakrooms.

If you are wearing a mask, but others around you aren't, you're still in a risky situation, so be extra cautious.

3. You're inside.

Outdoor activities are generally safer than indoor activities. A study of more than 7,300 cases in China show that just one case was linked to outdoor transmission.

For example, playing golf in a small group outside is less risky than practicing yoga with a small group in an enclosed room. And eating inside a restaurant is much riskier than eating outside. If you are going to a restaurant, pick one with outdoor seating.

4. You're having contact with people you don't live with.

Sustained contact (more than 15 minutes) is a higher risk situation than brief contact. For example, stopping to talk to someone while you're out walking your dog is much riskier than just walking by and waving hello.

5. There are a lot of people around.

We are all craving social interaction, but please avoid large social gatherings. Try to restrict your circle to a small group of people you trust.

If you absolutely must host a social gathering, take precautions to minimize risk:

Limit your guest list to 10 people or less

Hold gatherings outside

Place chairs or tables 6 feet apart

Ask guests to bring their own coolers with beverages and snacks

Reserve a designated bathroom for guests Put out disposable paper towels rather than a cloth towel Have disinfectant wipes available to wipe area after use



6. People are yelling, laughing or singing without masks on.

Talking, yelling, exercising and singing can spread infected respiratory droplets. Any time inhaling and exhaling occur there is potential to spread the virus.

Singing and yelling aerosolize respiratory droplets, or convert them into a fine spray. Follow that with deep breathing, and you can start to understand how easy it is for tiny viral droplets to invade your lungs.

7. Food is laid out on tables and counters or isn't individually served.

People sharing food utensils and congregating around areas where food is laid out can pose a risk. Try to avoid buffet-style serving situations. And if you plan to attend a gathering where this is happening, consider eating before you go or bring your own snacks and drinks.

What about herd immunity?

You may have heard talk about herd immunity. Herd immunity is the idea that when most of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, it gives indirect protection to people who aren't.

The problem is that we don't know if people generate long-term immunity after they've had COVID-19. Some viruses only cause temporary immunity, or none at all. If the virus that causes COVID-19 doesn't generate a durable immune response inside the body, the concept of herd immunity won't work.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 70% or more of the population needs to have immunity to the coronavirus before herd immunity is achieved. Currently, it is estimated that Nebraska is well below this threshold. Even in the hardest hit areas, like New York City, studies indicate that only about 20% of residents have immunity.

Unfortunately, herd immunity isn't a realistic solution to the current pandemic. So it's up to all of us to choose safer activities over riskier ones, and take precautions in public.","        Skip to main content                    menu                 UNMC  Nebraska Medicine      Call For an Appointment  800.922.0000    Find a Doctor  Find a Location  Find a Service    Patients & Visitors  About Us  For Providers  Giving  Careers  One Chart              COVID-19: How we're keeping you safe  Read our visitor policy    The coronavirus is still in our community.

2,it is (more safe|safer) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52804795,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought

As lockdowns are eased all over the world, what are the risks of getting infected as people come into closer contact with each other?

It's a question that scientists have been exploring in a variety of settings including restaurants and offices.

Frustratingly, the evidence for how the virus can be transmitted is often slim and if the answers seem vague it's because the science is uncertain.

It comes amid pressure from businesses, such as pubs, to be allowed to reopen.

But the influence is also coming from people wondering if the rules are too strict.

What are the key factors?

The most obvious is distance.

Research that began in the 1930s showed that when someone coughs, most of the droplets they release either evaporate or fall to the ground within about one metre.

That's why the World Health Organization (WHO) settled on its ""one metre"" rule for social distancing.

Some governments have opted for a safer limit of 1.5m with the UK and others preferring an even more cautious 2m.

The guidance essentially means that the further you're apart, the safer you ought to be but it's not distance alone that matters.

The second key factor is timing - how long you're close to someone.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The UK government has adopted a 2m rule for social distancing

The UK government's advice is that spending six seconds with an infected person 1m away carries the same risk as spending one minute with them if they're 2m away.

And where it's not possible to keep your distance from a colleague, the aim is to limit the time together to 15 minutes.

But as well as timing, there's another important issue: ventilation.

Being outside carries the least risk because any virus released by someone infected will be diluted in the breeze.

That doesn't mean the possibility of transmission is zero.

Even out of doors, the UK's official advice is to stay 2m apart and, if you're closer, try not to talk face-to-face.

But inside, where there isn't much fresh air and where people might be close together for longer, the chances of becoming infected are obviously greater.

What are the risks indoors in a restaurant?

A fascinating insight comes from a study in the Chinese city of Guangzhou which tracked how a cluster of infections occurred.

Sitting at tables that were one metre apart, people were having a meal last January.

One of the diners was infected with coronavirus but hadn't realised because they had no symptoms.

But in the following days, another nine people who'd been in the restaurant at the time came down with Covid-19 - including five who'd been sitting at other tables several metres away.

Scientists investigating the infections reached a conclusion about the most likely route of transmission: that droplets containing the virus - released by the infected person - were circulated by air conditioning.

""The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow,"" their study says, blaming two air conditioning units mounted high on a wall.

This is not proof that the virus can be spread this way but the research certainly suggests that it is a plausible route.

And, if confirmed, it would mean that in any room with a similar system of ventilation, even moving tables more than one metre apart would still not guarantee to keep people safe.

What do we know about the effect of ventilation?

To try to understand the risks, a team from the University of Oregon, specialising in the study of microbes in buildings, simulated different types of ventilation in a restaurant.

In one scenario, someone at a corner table coughs without covering their mouth and releases droplets and particles that are projected through the air.

The largest droplets land on their own table - that's what you'd expect with the WHO's 'one metre rule'.

Image copyright University of Oregon Image caption Computer modelling by the University of Oregon showing the potential spread of coronavirus in a restaurant with an air conditioning unit

But smaller ones reach beyond the immediate area and are caught in a current of air coming from an air conditioning unit at the other end of the room.

The result is similar to what's thought to have happened in the restaurant in Guangzhou: tiny droplets and particles are spread to people at other tables.

As with that study, this simulation doesn't prove that the coronavirus can be transmitted this way or, if it did, that it would make anyone ill.

That depends on whether the virus is still active after being blown across the room and on whether the person receiving it gets a large enough ""dose"" - but the possibility of infection can't be ruled out.

According Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg, professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, who led the study, the virus ""can be spread further than people might realise"".

What can be done to make restaurants safer?

The Oregon team simulated another scenario in the same restaurant in which there's an open window beside the person who coughs and an extractor vent on the opposite wall.

This time the cloud of droplets and particles is not pushed around the room but instead travels in a fairly direct line from window to vent with the result that fewer people are caught in it.

A flow of fresh air to dilute the virus is one of several techniques highlighted by the team as options for managing Covid-19.

Image copyright University of Oregon Image caption The simulations showed how fresh air from an open window could carry the virus to a vent

""It's really impossible to completely eliminate risk,"" says Prof Van Den Wymelenberg, ""but what we showed was a concept for how you could reduce transmission.""

""The good news is that there are things you can do to make safer spaces.""

In addition to bringing in fresh air through windows or mechanical ventilation, other options include improving the standard of filtration and also humidifying the air - moist conditions might encourage droplets to sink to the floor.

What does this mean on planes?

Social distancing isn't likely to be possible - unless the aircraft is half empty - and by definition you'll be in close contact with others for more than 15 minutes.

So on the basis of those two key factors, the risks may well be higher. The question of ventilation is more debatable.

On the one hand, the air in the cabin is constantly circulated so if someone coughs, even a few rows away, there is a chance the infection will be spread.

On the other hand, modern aircraft filter the cabin air every few minutes and to a high standard.

What about the risks at work?

In factories and offices, social distancing may be harder to follow.

Dr Julian Tang of the University of Leicester has come up an easy ""breath test"" to check if you're too close to colleagues.

A consultant virologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, he's studied how the air is moved when people speak and concludes that something as simple as a conversation could pass the virus.

""If you can smell your friend's breath - the garlic or curry or alcohol - you're inhaling what they're breathing out.

""And if you're inhaling enough of that air to smell it, then you're close enough to inhale any virus that's also carried in the air with it.""

So how can transmission take place?

So far the public advice has focused on what's called the ""droplet"" route, someone coughing or sneezing into the eyes, nose or mouth of a person nearby, which has led to the social distancing rules.

It's also highlighted a second route - surfaces - in which a person who's infected passes on the virus through contact either directly by shaking hands or by exhaling over surfaces like kitchen worktops.

Image copyright Hexagon/MSC Image caption Modelling by Hexagon/MSC Software showing how an infected person could pass the virus to a fellow passenger on a train.

Others then get the contamination on their hands, directly or by using the same space at work or at home - which is why handwashing is so important.

But there's a third possibility as well - tiny droplets or particles being carried in the air by speech, for example and that route might be the most important, according to Dr Tang.

""When you're talking to a colleague you don't touch them, you don't spit on them, most of the interaction is by voice and breathing.""

All of which reinforces the idea that there isn't one way to stay safe: it involves social distancing and keeping any close contacts brief and checking for healthy ventilation.

2,it is (more safe|safer) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53222356,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Passport control at Larnaca airport, Cyprus

The EU has decided that from Wednesday EU borders will be reopened to citizens from 15 non-EU countries, including Canada, Morocco and Australia, but not the US, Brazil and Russia.

China is on the list, but subject to a reciprocal agreement, still pending.

The unanimous decision by the European Council is not legally binding, so states can choose not to open up to all those countries.

Diplomats spent five days debating the list, amid varying pandemic concerns.

The so-called ""safe travel destinations"" are, besides China: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.

The UK and four other non-EU states - Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - are automatically included as ""safe"".

The BBC's Gavin Lee in Brussels says there was intense lobbying by representatives of the US, Russia and Turkey to get included on the list.

EU officials say the decision was based on a number of scientific factors:

Ensuring that the Covid-19 infection rate in the country was low enough (where nations had fewer than 16 in every 100,000 infected)

That there was a downward trend of cases

That social distancing measures were at ""a sufficient level""

One diplomat from a north European member state told the BBC that a ""certain amount of geopolitics influenced the decision too"" and that ""Balkan and Eastern European states had recommended"" that Georgia, a former Soviet state, be included.

The Hungarian government is understood to have lobbied for Serbia's inclusion. Spanish officials say they requested that Morocco be on the list, provided there was an agreement of reciprocity.

Denmark and Austria were among several member states arguing for the number of countries to be fewer than 15.

But in the end, it was adopted unanimously by member states.

Each state will have to announce when it intends to start readmitting citizens from some or all of those countries.

French officials say they expect to implement the decision in the ""coming days"".

The Czech Republic has published a list of eight countries that it considers safe for travel.

The EU list will be updated every two weeks.

UK covered by Brexit transition phase

Many border controls have been lifted for EU citizens travelling inside the bloc. Future rules for UK travellers are part of the current Brexit negotiations.

But UK nationals are still to be treated in the same way as EU citizens until the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, the EU Commission says.

So during this period UK nationals and their family members are exempt from the EU's temporary travel restriction.

EU nations in the 26-member Schengen zone normally allow passport-free border crossings for EU citizens, but national authorities have reimposed restrictions in this crisis.

The UK is currently negotiating temporary ""air bridges"" with several EU member states, so that the coronavirus pandemic does not totally block summer holidays - the busiest season in Europe for tourism, which employs millions of people.

In the EU discussions there were splits between those such as Spain - wanting the boost of tourism, but preferring to play safe because they have been hit so hard by Covid-19 - and others like Greece and Portugal, which depend on tourism but are less scarred by the virus.

You'd think it'd be quite straightforward, deciding which non-EU countries to consider ""safe"". But it's been a tortuous, divisive process, mixing politics and economics, as well as public health.

Countries like Germany and Spain, horrified by the devastation of Covid-19, wanted to play it safe.

They pushed to have a short list of countries with low infection rates, a good health service and reliable health data.

But Greece and Portugal had other ideas. Anxious to boost their post-lockdown, flagging economies with tourism, and less scarred by widespread infection at the height of the pandemic, they wanted as long a list as possible.

Then came France, insisting on reciprocity. If a non-EU country was barring flights from the bloc, argued Paris, they shouldn't appear on the list.

And finally: diplomatic considerations. How awkward for the EU to include some countries but not others. Thumbs up to visitors from Canada, Japan and China from 1 July - if Beijing allows EU visitors entry - but not travellers from the US.

After days of haggling, the final list is an attempted compromise. Much metaphorical sweat, blood and tears for a list that is advisory only, open to exceptions and will be regularly tweaked and updated.","        Homepage Accessibility links Skip to content Accessibility Help  BBC Account Notifications  Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Menu Search Search the BBC Search the BBC             News   BBC News Navigation     Sections           Home      Video      World   selected     UK      Business      Tech      Science      Stories      Entertainment & Arts      Health      World News TV      In Pictures      Reality Check      Newsbeat      Special Reports      Explainers      The Reporters      Have Your Say        World  selected     Africa      Asia      Australia      Europe   selected     Latin America      Middle East      US & Canada                 Europe               Europe              Coronavirus: EU to allow in visitors from 15 'safe' countries       30 June 2020              Share this with Facebook           Share this with Messenger           Share this with Twitter           Share this with Email           Share this with Facebook           Share this with WhatsApp           Share this with Messenger           Share this with Twitter      Share    Share this with  These are external links and will open in a new window      Email  Share this with Email       Facebook  Share this with Facebook       Messenger  Share this with Messenger       Messenger  Share this with Messenger       Twitter  Share this with Twitter       Pinterest  Share this with Pinterest       WhatsApp  Share this with WhatsApp       LinkedIn  Share this with LinkedIn     Copy this link   https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53222356   Read more about sharing.

Most of these changes would amount to an earthquake for corporate culture, making the office less social, interactive, and serendipitous, and more like the amalgamation of many private workstations. Until we have a vaccine, and perhaps even after, many workers may determine that if they’re going to feel as alone in the office as they do at home, there’s no point to commuting in the first place.

The future is uncertain, and alternative scenarios are possible, especially if offices adopt widespread tests and temperature checks for months or years before the broad administration of a vaccine. These tests, while strict, might make some people feel safer inside the office than in any other public venue that lacks similar health transparency. With the confidence that work is the safest place other than their own home, some employees might treat the office as a multipurpose isolation unit. Drinking at work, under the protective shield of temperature checks, would make for a safer coronavirus-era ritual than gathering colleagues at an actual bar.

2. COVID-PROOF THE RESTAURANTS

On January 24, a Chinese family of five sat down to lunch in a crowded restaurant in Guangzhou, the most populous city in southern China. They had arrived in the city the previous day from Wuhan. It was a balmy afternoon in Guangzhou, with mid-day temperatures rising into the high 70s, and the restaurant on the third floor of a five-story building was buzzing with more than 80 patrons and no windows. The family gathered around a table along the back wall, between two local families, as an air conditioner pumped cool air across the three tables.","    xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""   Skip to content     Sign in My Account Subscribe      Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest  Sections  Politics  Ideas  Photo  Science  Culture  Podcasts  Health  Education  Video  Technology  Family  Projects  Business  Global  Events  Books  Fiction  Newsletters   The Atlantic Crossword Play Crossword  The Print Edition Latest Issue  Past Issues Give a Gift      Search The Atlantic  Quick Links   Dear Therapist  Crossword Puzzle  Manage Subscription   Popular Latest Sign In My Account Subscribe      Ideas   Social Distancing Is Not Enough   We will need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the sort of interactions that can lead to more infections.   May 22, 2020  Derek Thompson Staff writer at The Atlantic       Piotr Malecki / Panos Pictures / R​edux     Link Copied    Updated at 12:08 a.m. ET on May 26, 2020. COVID-19 has mounted a sustained attack on public life, especially indoor life. Many of the largest super-spreader events took place inside—at a church in South Korea , an auditorium in France , a conference in Massachusetts . The danger of the indoors is more than anecdotal. A Hong Kong paper awaiting peer review found that of 7,324 documented cases in China, only one outbreak occurred outside—during a conversation among several men in a small village. The risk of infection indoors is almost 19 times higher than in open-air environments, according to another study from researchers in Japan . Appropriately, just about every public indoor space in America has been shut down or, in the case of essential businesses such as grocers, adapted for social-distancing restrictions. These closures have been economically ruinous, transforming large swaths of urban and suburban life into a morbid line of darkened windows . Today, states are emerging from the lockdown phase of the crisis and entering a queasy period of reopening. But offices, schools, stores, theaters, restaurants, bars, gyms, fitness centers, and museums will have no semblance of normalcy until we learn how to be safe—and feel safe—inside.        Read: A guide to staying safe as states reopen To open these spaces, we must be guided by science and expertise. Fortunately for us, researchers are discovering the secrets of how COVID-19 spreads with a combination of clever modeling and detective work. Before we review the relevant studies and draw out lessons for the future of the great indoors, a brief word of humility. Our understanding of this disease is dynamic. Today’s conventional wisdom could be tomorrow’s busted myth. Think of these studies not as gospels, but as clues in a gradually unraveling mystery. 1.  COVID-PROOF THE OFFICE On March 8, South Korean public-health officials learned of a COVID-19-positive patient working in a call center in downtown Seoul. The office was located in one of the densest parts of the city, on the 11th floor of a 19-story mixed-use building with hundreds of offices and apartments. More than 1,000 people worked or lived in the building, sharing several elevators and a lobby. The possibility of mass infection was high. But investigators found that the outbreak was surprisingly concentrated . Of the 97 people in the building who tested positive for the disease, 94 worked on one floor—in the call center. Of those 94, all but a handful worked in one densely packed phone bank. On one side of the floor, the disease was transmitted to two-thirds of employees. But less than 5 percent of the rest of the floor tested positive, as did less than 1 percent of the remainder of the building. A floor plan of the site of a coronavirus outbreak in Seoul, South Korea. The blue seats show where people with confirmed cases sat. ( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) In its conclusion, the Korean CDC writes that the spread of the virus was almost entirely limited to the one floor “despite considerable interaction between workers on different floors in the elevators and lobby.” This would suggest that the main facilitator wasn’t common touch points, such as doors and elevator buttons, but rather common airspace . When people talk—or sneeze or cough—they produce respiratory droplets that can come to rest in other people’s mouths, noses, and lungs. Talking for hours in close quarters, in an unventilated space, can create an ideal petri dish for COVID-19 transmission. It would be irresponsible to use the Korean study an an illustrative example if it were an outlier. But its main finding is fully in line with the emerging scientific consensus. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its summary of COVID-19 transmission to clarify that the virus “ does not spread easily ” from touching surfaces or objects—like, say, elevator buttons. Instead, they wrote, “the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person … through respiratory droplets.” [ Derek Thompson: What’s behind South Korea’s COVID-19 exceptionalism? ]        What does the science of indoor transmission mean for the future of the white-collar workplace? In a document shared with the World Bank , the South Korean government set out a 50-point plan for making offices safer. Masks are recommended for all employees. Desks and chairs are to be spread out or arranged in a “chess” or zigzag pattern so that no two individuals are sitting directly across from each other.

COVID-PROOF THE RESTAURANTS On January 24, a Chinese family of five sat down to lunch in a crowded restaurant in Guangzhou, the most populous city in southern China. They had arrived in the city the previous day from Wuhan. It was a balmy afternoon in Guangzhou, with mid-day temperatures rising into the high 70s, and the restaurant on the third floor of a five-story building was buzzing with more than 80 patrons and no windows. The family gathered around a table along the back wall, between two local families, as an air conditioner pumped cool air across the three tables.        Derek Thompson: The pandemic will change American retail forever When they left the restaurant, a member of the family felt a fever coming on and, after checking into the hospital, received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Within two weeks, multiple people from each of the three tables—and 10 lunch patrons from the Guangzhou restaurant in total—had been diagnosed with the disease. When the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the matter , it published a diagram that told a simple story: One asymptomatic person in a restaurant had infected nine others in the direct path of the air conditioner. None of the dozens of other patrons or servers got sick. A floor plan of restaurant tables and air-conditioning flow at the site of a coronavirus outbreak in Guangzhou, China. The yellow circle indicates an infected patient; red circles show future patients. ( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) It seemed to the researchers that the vector of transmission in the restaurant wasn’t a plate of food, an elevator button, or any matter of human touching, but air. Strong airflow from the AC unit had ferried coronavirus-poisoned droplets from table to table. “We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation,” the researchers wrote . Many of the necessary interventions for restaurants will adhere to the same philosophy that guides the reimagining of the office. Masks may become commonplace on servers, as might barriers between tables. In an interview with The Atlantic , the chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio suggested reducing interactions between patrons and waiters by asking diners to order their meals online before they arrive or on tablets at the table, like in an airport. Social distancing in the kitchen might mean fewer chefs, which could make complex dishes and extravagant plating impossible. “Until there’s a vaccine, I don’t think dine-in restaurants will get back to normal in this country,” Steve Salis, a restaurant owner in Washington, D.C., told me. “We could introduce things like finger bowls or hand wipes, like you have at some Japanese restaurants, but for every cuisine. We could add public sinks in the dining room, where people can get up and wash their hands at a counter. We might have to retrofit our restaurants to make them easier to clean. As for tables and bar stools, those will have to be socially distanced. At my diner, I might chop up booths to make them more private.” Read: Stanley Tucci on cooking your way through the pandemic Another idea: Put everything outside. Some American cities, including Berkeley, California, and Cincinnati , have done just that, by  announcing plans to close streets and free up outdoor dining space for restaurants. * But for many cities, wide-scale al fresco dining is unrealistic, not only because of necessary road use, but also because we can’t ask the weather to stop. There will be snow in Boston, wind in Chicago, and rain in Seattle. An open-air restaurant is a lovely thing, but ceilings were invented for a reason.        Restaurants will respond to the pandemic as they already have—by cobbling together a variety of businesses, including delivery and curbside pickup, and selling specialty groceries. Even so, their outlook is dire. Colicchio told me that more than half of American restaurants may not reopen. “In my case, for at least two of my restaurants, most of the business comes through private parties and conferences,” he said . “For the foreseeable future, that’s gone.” 3.  COVID-PROOF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT On the evening of Tuesday, March 10, 61 singers gathered for choir practice just north of Seattle. It was a standard rehearsal, as members sang in close quarters, shared snacks, and stacked chairs together at the end of the two-and-a-half-hour session. Five days later, the choir director sent an urgent email to the group. Several members had developed fevers, she said. The following Tuesday’s rehearsal was canceled. But by then, it was too late. Fifty-three of the 61 singers became ill, making for an “attack rate” of 87 percent. Three members of the choir were hospitalized. Two died. The Washington choir represents the most aggressive outbreak I have come across, with an attack rate almost twice as high as the Korean call center. It had many features we’ve already established to be dangerous: an intimate crowd gathered in a small room, sharing air, food, and surfaces. But what if singing accelerated the transmission of the disease? Read: How the pandemic will end In a study subsequently published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, ” researchers emphasized that “the act of singing, itself,” might have contributed to transmission, because choir members were belting out more of the virus. Some people—known as “superemitters”—release more particles into the air when they speak, because they are unusually loud or slobbery talkers. But even normal gabbers can release an exceptional number of droplets if they’re singing or theatrically projecting their voice. Many super-spreader events have been ceremonies that involve group prayers and exclamations, such as religious gatherings. On February 16, a 61-year-old Korean woman with COVID-19 triggered hundreds of infections when she prayed with 1,000 worshippers in a large windowless church in Daegu, South Korea. (To this day, more than 60 percent of Korea’s COVID-19 cases are in Daegu.) Two days later, in France, several hundred Christian worshippers from around the world packed into a dark auditorium in the small town of Mulhouse for an annual festival. French authorities have since linked more than 2,000 global cases to this one meeting, including cases in  French Guyana, Corsica, Burkina Faso, and Switzerland. These stories, combined with the science of large-droplet and airborne transmission, suggest that social distancing isn’t enough: We need saliva control too. Other countries are doing so, already. Germany has reportedly banned singing at religious services, and South Korea has prohibited spitting in its professional baseball league.        Spittle rules won’t be enough to make our public entertainment places safer, either. We will need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the sort of interactions that can lead to more infections. “When we go back to sports stadiums and theaters, people are going to have to adjust their expectations,” says Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure-assessment science at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health. First, he told me, full-capacity stadiums will be impossible in the social-distancing age, and most attendees will be advised to wear masks. Second, everything that can be made touchless should be, including ticketing and concessions. “To avoid clustering at the hot-dog stands, stadium food vendors should serve as much as possible directly to people’s seats,” Allen said. Third, public-entertainment venues will have to reimagine queuing. “Our theories about crowd control, which are dominated by concerns for physical security, typically squeeze large numbers of people into a scarce number of heavily guarded entrances,” he said. But in a pandemic, tightly packed queues are the very hazard we want to avoid. “It’ll be very important to reduce crowding at the entrance of stadiums and theaters by adding additional entrance points or staggering admissions by time to avoid overcrowding, Allen said. When you put all of these stories, studies, blueprints, and advice together, it amounts to a relatively straightforward pandemic playbook. For memory’s sake, let’s reduce the major takeaways to a convenient acronym: SAFE.  - Social distancing : This one you probably knew before you read this article. Keep a healthy distance between yourself and others—six feet is a good general rule—especially when you are near them for an extended period of time.  - Airflow awareness : Every noncontact activity—talking, eating, working out—becomes significantly safer when you take it outside. As the previously mentioned Japanese study and Hong Kong survey indicated, the odds of transmission in a closed, indoor space are several orders of magnitude higher than in open-air environments.  - Face masks : Wear them. They’re not just for you; they’re for everybody around you .  - Expectoration (sorry for using a fancy word for spit to make the acronym work): COVID-19 appears to spread both through large-droplet transmission, such as from sneezes, and through the airborne transmission of smaller, aerosolized droplets, such as those that spray out of the mouths of talkers. Beware especially of indoor environments and activities that naturally include lots of gabbing (such as a long office meeting), singing (such as a choir practice), shouting (such as a high-school gym), or heavy breathing (such as an intense indoor workout class ).  Read: America’s patchwork pandemic is fraying even further        As an indoor person myself—and a lover of theater, sports, and restaurants—it’s painful to think about the range of activities that will be pinched in the next year and the businesses and lives that will suffer for it. Toward the end of my reporting for this piece, I emailed a national-security worker who also teaches singing in the Washington, D.C., area. She’s heard that in-person singing may be off-limits until a vaccine is widely available, a possibility that would shutter musicals and vocal lessons for a year or longer. “Despite all the chaos and intense news, this has been the thing that has hit the hardest,” she said. So, she’s planning to offer singing lessons on Zoom. America’s public spaces will have to show a similar flexibility and resiliency to make it through the next year. Even as the United States reopens, some old rituals—such as going to bars, group workouts, and packed concerts—will have to remain paused. People will still drink and sweat and sing, just differently. Eventually, the old world will come back. The great indoors will return. But until then, Americans will have to balance their rituals and nostalgia with a humble respect for our unfolding understanding of COVID-19. *  This article previously misstated that Berkeley, California, had closed its streets to make space for outdoor dining.

2,it is (more safe|safer) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),5,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/2020/05/safety-tips-to-help-you-travel-again-during-covid-19-cvd/,"Although many restrictions are still in place, travel is slowly starting up again. People locked down for months want to stretch their legs, see something other than a screen, and boost the economy. Restaurants and some tourist attractions (Florida’s Universal Orlando Resort, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) are opening for local and domestic travel. A few countries (Greece, Italy) are starting to welcome international travelers.

But how can you safely explore a world of potentially deadly encounters with friendly people who might infect you (or who you might expose to the virus)? Is the airplane really a soaring petri dish? Is visiting a national park possible while social distancing? And if you choose a seemingly safer road trip, can you stop to use a public restroom?

A poll by National Geographic and Morning Consult finds that just 2 percent of 2,200 Americans said they’d jump on a plane now, and only another 8 percent would consider it later this summer. That’s wise with travel advisories still in place, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warnings against international travel and cautions about travel within the U.S., and with many countries and states (Maine, Hawaii) still requiring 14 days of post-travel self-isolation regardless of symptoms.

As we recently report, travel planning is good for your mental health. Knowing more about real and perceived COVID-19 risks might help you feel better about getting out as roadblocks lift. Here are best practices for travelers.

Should I get on an airplane?

Challenge: Being crammed next to strangers in a flying metal tube

Best practice: It’s reassuring to know that “data to date suggest only rare possible occurrences of in-flight transmission” of COVID-19, says Dr. Lin H. Chen, associate professor at Harvard Medical School and director of Cambridge’s Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn. She explains that if everyone follows the World Health Organization’s guidelines, the risk of transmission aboard planes, and anywhere else, is significantly reduced.

“Many people think they get sick on an airplane, but the reality is that the air quality on an airplane is actually really good—high amounts of clean outdoor air and all recirculated air passes through a HEPA filter,” says Joe Allen. An assistant professor and director of the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Allen explains that you’re more likely to pick up a bug standing in line at airport security, at the boarding gate, or on the subway.

Airports and airlines are trying to minimize the risks of contagions in their often-crowded environments. Intensive cleaning is now the norm; planes are now being fogged with electrostatic disinfectant that sticks to surfaces like seatbelts. Some airlines give you wipes and the Transportation Security Administration has upped the size of hand sanitizer bottles you can bring on board from 3.4 ounces to 12.

Face coverings are required to board most flights. Airlines are trying to seat people so they have more space. But that doesn’t necessarily mean middle seats are remaining empty, especially with reductions in numbers of flights. There’s no national U.S. policy yet, but several airlines are checking for fevers. They won’t let you fly with a temperature above 100.4℉ (though testing is far from foolproof).

Internationally, some destinations require proof of a negative COVID-19 test; other destinations test passengers on arrival. Many have mandatory 14-day quarantines, sometimes requiring you to submit a quarantine plan for approval, download an app, or get a tracking bracelet to ensure you follow the rules. Vaccination certification may eventually be needed for travel, but so far the science doesn’t support “immunity passports” or proof that a person has had COVID-19 and is, in theory, immune.

Should I head to a national park?

Challenge: Avoiding big crowds in the great outdoors

Best practice: “There are many health benefits to being outside in nature, and the risks are low and manageable,” says Allen. The key is keeping a six-foot distance. A good practice at a park is to pretend that other people are grizzly bears and stay away from them.

Check the National Park Service’s find-a-park website to see if the park is closed or partially closed (restrooms and food services, in particular), for limits on numbers of visitors, and other rules like mask-wearing. Avoid group activities that involve close contact and practice social distancing at camp sites. Joyce Sanchez, an infectious disease specialist and medical director of the Travel Health Clinic at Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, reminds us that “summer is tick and mosquito season,” so don’t forget your bug spray and sunscreen (though perhaps a face-mask tan will become a badge of honor that you’re doing your part to protect others).

Should I rent a cottage by the sea?

Challenge: Assessing the safety of beaches and vacation rentals

Best practice: Like park trips, seaside vacations are great if you can stay away from others and obey beach closure rules. There’s no evidence you can catch COVID-19 from the water (it’s other people you should be concerned about). Remember to bring your two best beach friends: reef-safe sunscreen free of oxybenzone and hand sanitizer.

Should I stay in a hotel?

Challenge: Distancing safely and trusting housekeeping

Best practice: Hotels that take better care of their employees (by providing them with personal protective equipment and paid sick leave) are more likely to take better care of you. Check the website of any hotel you’re considering to determine how they’re responding to COVID-19. Many U.S. hotels are following the American Hotel and Lodging Association’s new Safe Stay guidelines.

Choose properties that base their protocols on science, rather than things that sound good but have little effect or take focus away from areas that really matter. Look for hotels that have installed plexiglass at reception and that require staff to wear masks, or where you can check-in online and use your phone as your room key.

Avoid elevators and, if able, “take the opportunity to exercise and use the stairs,” advises Sanchez. Room service may be safer than the restaurant. Go for a swim if the pool isn’t crowded: Standard pool cleaning kills viruses, so the pool is probably safe; it’s the people you need to worry about. While clean rooms are important, what’s more important is staying six feet away from others. And, of course, wash your hands when you arrive in your room and again before you leave.

Should I use a public restroom?

Challenge: Taking care of business in busy bathrooms

Best practice: Assume public restrooms “are not properly disinfected and treat surfaces as if they have live virus on them,” says Sanchez. That said, it’s often necessary to use. When you do, choose single-stall and well-ventilated bathrooms if you can, and keep your distance from others.

Chen says that “good hand hygiene is key after using a public bathroom,” meaning wash and dry your hands; if there’s no soap, use hand sanitizer. She adds “I am unaware of any data to show that flushing aerosolizes SARS-CoV-2 and transmits the virus.” Regardless, it’s always good practice to put the lid down before you flush.

What about people who don’t wear masks?

Challenge: Staying safe while respecting others’ boundaries

Best practice: Following all the new COVID-19 protocols takes some getting used to. It’s easy to revert to pre-pandemic habits in new situations, when we’re stressed, and when we’re trying to relax and have fun. Being as kind and understanding as possible helps minimize stress.

Setting a good example is the best way to encourage others. Jonathon Day, associate professor and graduate program director at Purdue’s School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, says “safety when traveling (and when out and about in general) is a ‘co-creation.’”

“If it’s someone you know who is non-mask-wearing [or] non-social-distancing, it might be worth discussing the reasoning behind these measures,” says Chen. Remember that not everyone can wear a mask and that we’re all human and can forget the new norms. You could politely ask anyone who gets too close “would you mind giving us a bit more space, please?” but it might be easier just to move away from them. It’s likely not worth the risk, or the stress, to confront a stranger. If you can’t escape the situation, ask a store manager or flight attendant for help.

Remember that, with communicable diseases, “if everyone is responsible to themselves and community/society, then we would all be safer,” says Chen.

Know the safety basics

We’re still learning about COVID-19. But one consensus is that it seems to spread most easily by close contact between people. The CDC says that touching objects isn’t the main way of contracting it.

This means that whenever you’re away from home, the most important thing you can do is maintain a six-foot (or more) distance from people you don’t live with. Wearing a face covering also minimizes the chance you’ll pass a virus or other illness to others.

Other key prevention measures, outlined by the World Health Organization and other public health authorities: washing your hands well, avoiding touching your face, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, disinfecting frequently touched items like your phone, and staying home if you’re sick. Practicing these measures keeps you—and everyone else—safer, regardless of how far you roam. “COVID-19 has shown that we have shared responsibilities to reduce spread,” says Chen, who’s president of the International Society of Travel Medicine.

General considerations for travel

During a pandemic, going to the grocery store—let alone traveling to another city or country—requires new protocols. Follow policies about lockdown restrictions and mandatory quarantines, both at home and at your planned destination. The CDC provides links to the rules of each state’s and territory’s health departments. Many international borders remain closed to nonessential travel, and some countries also limit domestic travel between regions.

Examine your personal situation. Extra cautions are needed for anyone at elevated risk of contracting COVID-19. Check post-travel quarantine rules, including your employer’s. Just as important as protecting you and your loved ones is shielding other people. You don’t want to bring the virus from your community, especially to places with low case numbers, or bring it home (the CDC tracks cases and deaths by state and county). Consider whether the benefits of travel outweigh the risk that you might spread the virus.

When deciding where to go and how you’ll get there, scrutinize how easy it will be to stay away from other people. “Generally speaking, driving is going to be safer than flying commercially from an infection standpoint because you can control how you reach your destination—who is sharing the car with you, what measures are used for disinfecting surfaces, where you stop along the way, and when you return,” says Sanchez.","                        xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""? svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd""                                          https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/2020/05/safety-tips-to-help-you-travel-again-during-covid-19-cvd.html  © 1996-2015 National Geographic Society, © 2015-

Photograph by CLEMENT MAHOUDEA, AFP/Getty Images          Regarding rentals, ask whether properties are cleaned according to public health guidelines, such as the WHO’s accommodation sector advice . Airbnb’s Enhanced Cleaning Initiative includes a 24- to 72-hour vacancy period between guests (though cleaners may visit during that window), but it’s likely unnecessary given evidence that the coronavirus floats in the air only up to three hours . Since it’s possible for the virus to live on surfaces for two or three days , you could give high-touch surfaces an extra clean. As Chen says, “good hand washing should overcome potentially contaminated touching.” If anxiety outweighs the benefits of a vacation, it’s a sign you’re not ready to venture out yet.

3,(risk|taking any risk) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/assessing-risk-factors.html,"COVID-19 can affect anyone, and the disease can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe. For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors.” Examples include older age or having certain underlying medical conditions.

CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations.

CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners.

Why Risk Factors Matter

People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection.

It is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you:

Take precautions as you go about your daily life and attend events.

Better understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19.

Anticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick.

Reduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors.

How We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease

Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. Potential risk factors that have been identified to date include:

Age

Race/ethnicity

Gender

Some medical conditions

Use of certain medications

Poverty and crowding

Certain occupations

Pregnancy

Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person’s risk.

Investigations

CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below. These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations.

3,(risk|taking any risk) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on June 25, 2020 to reflect available data as of May 29, 2020. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.

People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.  People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:  People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:   Chronic kidney disease  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant  Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)  Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies  Sickle cell disease  Type 2 diabetes mellitus   Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.  COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:   Asthma (moderate-to-severe)  Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)  Cystic fibrosis  Hypertension or high blood pressure  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines  Neurologic conditions, such as dementia  Liver disease  Pregnancy  Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)  Smoking  Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)  Type 1 diabetes mellitus   Want to see the evidence behind these lists?  The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.  Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19  It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.  The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:   Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.  Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.   If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.  Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.  As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities , running errands, and attending events and gatherings . There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.  People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves . Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.  In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.   If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions .  Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.  If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.   Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:  When to delay or cancel a visit   Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:  If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:  Lowest risk : Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.  More risk : Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).  Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.  Highest risk : Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

3,(risk|taking any risk) (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/flu-sick-days.html,"These tips can help people with diabetes prepare for getting sick and take care of themselves if they do become ill.

Like everyone, people with diabetes can get sick even when trying their best to prevent it. So being prepared and knowing what to do if you get sick is very important. There are several things you can do now, but also talk to your doctor about the best way to handle being sick if it happens. Visit these pages for more information:

These tips can help you take care of yourself if you get sick.

Prepare Now Before Getting Sick

Make sure you have insulin, other diabetes medicines, and easy-to-fix foods in your home, enough for several weeks or longer:

Medicines and supplies

Milk of magnesia Medicine to control diarrhea Antacid Pain reliever Thermometer Suppositories to treat vomiting



Foods

Sports drinks Juice boxes Canned soup Regular gelatin Regular soft drinks Instant cooked cereals Crackers Instant pudding Unsweetened applesauce

If you can’t eat meals, you will need to eat or drink about 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours, such as 1½ cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1½ cup of fruit juice.

If You Get Sick

If you do get sick, your blood sugar can be hard to manage. You may not be able to eat or drink as much as usual, which can affect blood sugar levels.

Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar more often when you’re sick. That’s because when your body releases hormones to fight the illness, those hormones can also raise your blood sugar levels and increase how much insulin you need. This is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes since they depend on insulin to live.

When your body doesn’t have enough insulin, it starts breaking down fat as fuel, which produces ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can cause diabetic ketoacidosisexternal icon, or DKA. DKA is very serious and can cause a coma or even death.

If you think you may have DKA, use an over-the-counter kit to test your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, call your doctor right away. You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment.

Follow these additional steps when you’re sick even if your blood sugar is within your target range:

Continue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual .

. Test your blood sugar every 4 hours and keep track of the results.

Drink extra calorie-free liquids*, and try to eat as you normally would.

Weigh yourself every day. Losing weight without trying is a sign of high blood glucose.

Check your temperature every morning and evening. A fever may be a sign of infection.

*Drink plenty of fluids – 4 to 6 ounces every half-hour – to prevent dehydration. You may also need to drink beverages with sugar if you cannot get 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours from other food choices. Drink small portions of these sweet beverages to keep your blood sugar from getting too high.","                           Skip directly to site content  Skip directly to page options  Skip directly to A-Z link         Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

4,chance of (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/current-risk-assessment-novel-coronavirus-situation,"What is the risk of COVID-19 to the general population as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

The risk of COVID 19 in the general population of the EU/EEA and the UK is currently assessed as:

Low in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing showing very low detection rates.

Moderate in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.

This assessment is based on the information below:

Decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed and sustained in almost all Member States, but several are still reporting ongoing community transmission:

As of 10 June, 29 EU/EEA countries and the UK had a decreasing 14-day incidence, while the 14-day incidence was at the highest level yet observed in two countries (Poland and Sweden).

Twenty-eight countries are reporting a current 14-day incidence below 20 cases per 100 000 population. In two countries (Portugal and the United Kingdom) the current 14-day incidence remains at a rate between 20 and 100 cases per 100 000 population. In one country (Sweden) the current 14-day incidence is above 100 cases per 100 000 population.

There remains uncertainty as to the extent of viral circulation as there is limited information available on the proportion of community transmission that occurs outside of known transmission chains and/or due to importation across countries.

The implementation of robust response measures in the EU was temporarily associated with an observed decrease in incidence. Although the composition and intensity of implementation varied, all EU/EEA countries and the UK introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (recommended or enforced – refer to Annex 4). While uncertainty remains about the extent to which the combination and intensity of these measures had an impact on transmission, such measures appear to have been associated, at least temporarily, with decreases in the number of newly reported cases.

In summary, the probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2 for the general population ranges from low (in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing, showing very low detection rates) to very high (in areas where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place and where community transmission is still high).

While the majority of cases of COVID-19 have a mild course of illness, the analysis of data from TESSy shows that the risk of hospitalisation increases rapidly with age, from as early as 30 years, and that the risk of death increases from the age of 50 years, although the majority of hospitalisations and deaths are among the oldest age groups. Older males are particularly affected, being more likely than females of the same age to be hospitalised, require ICU/respiratory support, or die. All-cause excess mortality from EuroMOMO, particularly at this time when competing drivers (influenza and high/low temperatures) are largely absent, shows considerable excess mortality in multiple countries, affecting both the 15−64 and 65+ years age groups in the pooled analysis. Once infected, no specific treatment for COVID-19 exists, however early supportive therapy may improve outcomes. There are ongoing trials that have demonstrated some evidence for limited reduction of symptom duration. There is evidence that since the start of the pandemic, case management, supportive treatment and care has improved.

Overall, the impact of COVID-19 is assessed as moderate for the general population.

What is the risk of COVID-19 to the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

The risk of COVID 19 to the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome is currently assessed as:

Moderate in areas where community transmission has been reduced and/or maintained at low levels and where there is extensive testing showing very low detection rates.

Very high in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.

This assessment was based on the information below:

The probability of infection in the different areas has been assessed above and is the same for populations with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome: from low to very high.

Analysis of TESSy data shows that persons over 65 years of age and/or with underlying health conditions infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk of severe illness and death compared with younger individuals.

Long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which commonly house the elderly and the frail, have been heavily affected by COVID-19. The disease spreads rapidly on introduction, causing high morbidity in residents, commonly with a case fatality of over 25%. LTCFs were the focus of over half of the fatal COVID-19 cases in several EU/EEA countries and the UK. In summary, the impact of COVID-19 is assessed as very high in the population with defined factors associated with severe disease outcome.

What is the risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to levels that require stricter response measures, as a consequence of lifting/adjusting community level physical distancing measures?

The risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to a level that may require the re-introduction of stricter control measures is currently assessed as:

Moderate if measures are phased out gradually, when only sporadic or cluster transmission is reported, and when appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place.

High if measures are phased out when there is still ongoing community transmission, and no appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place.

This assessment was based on the information below:

The implementation of robust response measures in EU/EEA countries and the UK was temporarily associated with a decrease in incidence.

In the few weeks since the phase-out of some of the response measures, no rapid or major increase in incidence has been observed. Although the composition and intensity of implementation vary, all EU/EEA countries and the UK have introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission (recommended or enforced).

In addition to the implemented response measures, other factors may have contributed to the observed decrease in incidence including seasonality, self-awareness of the population in disease prevention and adherence to measures implemented by governments, a better application of infection prevention and control measures in the community and healthcare settings, and an increase in the offer of testing for exposed and/or symptomatic individuals.

The decrease in incidence at national level may hide a level of heterogeneity in disease incidence at subnational level.

While decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed, Member States are still reporting community transmission.

The information available from sero-epidemiological studies provides an indication that the population immunity is still low (<10%), therefore there is still a risk that susceptible individuals may become infected.

Even though no major increases in disease incidence have been observed in the weeks since the phase-out of non-pharmaceutical interventions began, an associated upsurge may still be anticipated. However, the reestablishment of transmission chains and larger clusters would take a few generations of infection.

The rate at which incidence of COVID-19 cases, and associated hospitalisations and deaths, could increase will depend on the effectiveness of the control measures that remain in place and on the extent to which people change their behaviour in comparison to the pre-COVID-19 era:

If people are more cautious, having learned about the risks of the disease or if they are instructed to change their behaviour (e.g. by wearing masks), the transmission rate would be lower than before measures were introduced.

However, the progressive lifting of the prohibition of mass gatherings may lead to some people meeting in larger numbers.

Furthermore, the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation or ICU care may be lower if older people and those who belong to risk groups restrict their contact rates to a greater extent than the general population following the phasing out of measures.

In summary, the probability of the risk of COVID-19 incidence rising to levels that require stricter response measures, as a consequence of lifting/adjusting community level physical distancing measures ranges from moderate (if measures are phased out gradually, when only sporadic or cluster transmission is reported, and when appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place) to very high (if measures are phased out when there is still ongoing community transmission, and no appropriate monitoring systems and capacities for extensive testing and contact tracing are in place).

An increase in COVID-19 incidence would be associated with increasing morbidity and mortality, with more severe morbidity and mortality likely if individuals at increased risk of severe outcome are not properly shielded. Such an increase, if not checked rapidly, may place healthcare systems under stress, as was seen in March and April 2020

in several EU/EEA countries and the UK. However, a set of control measures are now known to be effective in checking and reversing the trend towards increasing incidence within a period of about two-to-three weeks.

Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 incidence rising is assessed as moderate.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  All topics: A to Z  Coronavirus  Threats and outbreaks  COVID-19  Assessing the risk to the EU                   COVID-19            Situation updates on COVID-19    Assessing the risk to the EU    Facts    Latest evidence    Surveillance    Testing strategies    Laboratory support    Preparedness    Latest outputs    External resources               Risk assessment on COVID-19, 11 June 2020    Risk assessment      Twitter     Facebook     Linked In     Mail          What is the risk of COVID-19 to the general population as of 10 June 2020 in the EU/EEA and UK?

Moderate in areas where there is substantial ongoing community transmission and where appropriate physical distancing measures are not in place.  This assessment is based on the information below:  Decreasing trends in disease incidence are observed and sustained in almost all Member States, but several are still reporting ongoing community transmission:  As of 10 June, 29 EU/EEA countries and the UK had a decreasing 14-day incidence, while the 14-day incidence was at the highest level yet observed in two countries (Poland and Sweden).  Twenty-eight countries are reporting a current 14-day incidence below 20 cases per 100 000 population. In two countries (Portugal and the United Kingdom) the current 14-day incidence remains at a rate between 20 and 100 cases per 100 000 population. In one country (Sweden) the current 14-day incidence is above 100 cases per 100 000 population.  There remains uncertainty as to the extent of viral circulation as there is limited information available on the proportion of community transmission that occurs outside of known transmission chains and/or due to importation across countries.  The implementation of robust response measures in the EU was temporarily associated with an observed decrease in incidence. Although the composition and intensity of implementation varied, all EU/EEA countries and the UK introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (recommended or enforced – refer to Annex 4).

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak, which is phylogenetically in the SARS-CoV clade. The disease associated with the virus is referred to as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As of 11 March 2020, 118 598 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide by more than 100 countries. Since late February, the majority of cases reported are from outside China, with an increasing majority of these reported from EU/EEA countries and the UK.

The Director General of the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.

All EU/EEA countries and the UK are affected, reporting a total of 17 413 cases as of 11 March. Seven hundred and eleven cases reported by EU/EEA countries and the UK have died. Italy represents 58% of the cases (n=10 149) and 88% of the fatalities (n=631). The current pace of the increase in cases in the EU/EEA and the UK mirrors trends seen in China in January-early February and trends seen in Italy in mid-February.

Need for immediate targeted action

In the current situation where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading worldwide and the number of cases in Europe is rising with increasing pace in several affected areas, there is a need for immediate targeted action. The speed with which COVID-19 can cause nationally incapacitating epidemics once transmission within the community is established, indicates that in a few weeks or even days, it is likely that similar situations to those seen in China and Italy may be seen in other EU/EEA countries or the UK.

There are no vaccines available and there is little evidence on the effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents. In addition, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population against the new coronavirus and everyone in the population is assumed to be susceptible. Clinical presentations of COVID-19 range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia; severe disease can lead to death. While the majority of cases (80%) are milder respiratory infections and pneumonias, severe illness and death is more common among the elderly with other chronic underlying conditions, with these risk groups accounting for the majority of severe disease and fatalities to date.

Risk assessment

The risk of severe disease associated with COVID-19 infection for people in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered moderate for the general population and high for older adults and individuals with chronic underlying conditions, based on the probability of community transmission and the impact of the disease.

The risk of healthcare system capacity being exceeded in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is considered high. The impact and risk assessment on health system capacity can be mediated by the application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity measures.

The risk of transmission of COVID-19 in health and social institutions with large vulnerable populations is considered high. The impact of transmission in health and social institutions can be mediated by the application of effective infection prevention and control and surge capacity.

The EU/EEA and the UK are quickly moving toward a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19. The situation is evolving very quickly and a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential in order to delay transmission, as containing transmission to local epidemics is no longer considered feasible. A rapid shift from a containment to a mitigation approach is required, as the rapid increase in cases, that is anticipated in the coming days to few weeks may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to realise, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time. Measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems.

Necessary measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic

Given the current epidemiology and risk assessment, and the expected developments in the next days to few weeks, the following public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are necessary in EU/EEA countries:

Social distancing measures should be implemented early in order to mitigate the impact of the epidemic and to delay the epidemic peak. This can interrupt human-to-human transmission chains, prevent further spread, reduce the intensity of the epidemic and slow down the increase in cases, while allowing healthcare systems to prepare and cope with an increased influx of patients. Such measures should include: the immediate isolation of symptomatic persons suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19; the suspension of mass gatherings, taking into consideration the size of the event, the density of participants and if the event is in a confined indoor environment; social distancing measures at workplaces (for example teleworking, suspension of meetings, cancellation of non-essential travel); measures in and closure of schools, taking into consideration the uncertainty in the evidence of children in transmitting the disease, need for day care for children, impact on nursing staff, potential to increase transmission to vulnerable grandparents; cordon sanitaire of residential areas with high levels of community transmission.



Ensuring the public is aware of the seriousness of COVID-19. A high degree of population understanding, solidarity and discipline is required to apply strict personal hygiene, coughing etiquette, self-monitoring and social distancing measures. Community engagement and acceptance of stringent social distancing measures put in place are key in delaying and reducing further spread.

Prevention and control of COVID-19 in hospitals and long-term care facilities is an immediate priority in order to: (1) slow the demand for specialised healthcare, such as ICU beds; (2) safeguard populations vulnerable to severe outcomes of infection (3); protect healthcare workers that provide care; (4) minimise the export of cases to other healthcare facilities and the community.

Every healthcare facility should initiate training for all staff and those who may be required for healthcare provision during surge capacity. Countries should identify healthcare units that can be designated to care for COVID-19 cases, to minimise transmission to non-cases and to conserve PPE. Countries and healthcare institutions should identify additional facilities that can be used for the cohorting of cases with mild symptoms, in the event that surge capacity is exceeded by healthcare facilities. The highest priority for use of respirators (FFP2/3) are healthcare workers, in particular those performing aerosol-generating procedures, including swabbing.

If resources or capacity are limited, rational approaches should be implemented to prioritise high-yield actions, which include: rational use of confirmatory testing, reducing contact tracing to focus only on high-yield contacts, rational use of PPE and hospitalisation and implementing rational criteria for de-isolation. Testing approaches should prioritise vulnerable populations, protection of social and healthcare institutions, including staff.

National surveillance systems should initially aim at rapidly detecting cases and assessing community transmission. As the epidemic progresses, surveillance should monitor the intensity, geographical spread and the impact of the epidemic on the population and healthcare systems and assess the effectiveness of measures in place. In circumstances with capacity shortages and strict implementation of social distancing measures, surveillance should focus on severe acute respiratory infections, sentinel surveillance in outpatient clinics or collection of data through telephone helplines.

A strategic approach based on early and rigorous application of these measures will help reduce the burden and pressure on the healthcare system, and in particular on hospitals, and will allow more time for the testing of therapeutics and vaccine development.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  Publications & data  Rapid risk assessment: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK – sixth update                   Publications & data                Rapid risk assessment: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK – sixth update    Risk assessment   12 Mar 2020     Cite:    Citation Link     European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The EU/EEA and the UK are quickly moving toward a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19. The situation is evolving very quickly and a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential in order to delay transmission, as containing transmission to local epidemics is no longer considered feasible. A rapid shift from a containment to a mitigation approach is required, as the rapid increase in cases, that is anticipated in the coming days to few weeks may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to realise, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time. Measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems.  Necessary measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic  Given the current epidemiology and risk assessment, and the expected developments in the next days to few weeks, the following public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are necessary in EU/EEA countries:  Social distancing measures should be implemented early in order to mitigate the impact of the epidemic and to delay the epidemic peak. This can interrupt human-to-human transmission chains, prevent further spread, reduce the intensity of the epidemic and slow down the increase in cases, while allowing healthcare systems to prepare and cope with an increased influx of patients. Such measures should include: the immediate isolation of symptomatic persons suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19;  the suspension of mass gatherings, taking into consideration the size of the event, the density of participants and if the event is in a confined indoor environment;  social distancing measures at workplaces (for example teleworking, suspension of meetings, cancellation of non-essential travel);  measures in and closure of schools, taking into consideration the uncertainty in the evidence of children in transmitting the disease, need for day care for children, impact on nursing staff, potential to increase transmission to vulnerable grandparents;  cordon sanitaire of residential areas with high levels of community transmission.   Ensuring the public is aware of the seriousness of COVID-19. A high degree of population understanding, solidarity and discipline is required to apply strict personal hygiene, coughing etiquette, self-monitoring and social distancing measures. Community engagement and acceptance of stringent social distancing measures put in place are key in delaying and reducing further spread.  Prevention and control of COVID-19 in hospitals and long-term care facilities is an immediate priority in order to: (1) slow the demand for specialised healthcare, such as ICU beds; (2) safeguard populations vulnerable to severe outcomes of infection (3); protect healthcare workers that provide care; (4) minimise the export of cases to other healthcare facilities and the community.  Every healthcare facility should initiate training for all staff and those who may be required for healthcare provision during surge capacity. Countries should identify healthcare units that can be designated to care for COVID-19 cases, to minimise transmission to non-cases and to conserve PPE. Countries and healthcare institutions should identify additional facilities that can be used for the cohorting of cases with mild symptoms, in the event that surge capacity is exceeded by healthcare facilities. The highest priority for use of respirators (FFP2/3) are healthcare workers, in particular those performing aerosol-generating procedures, including swabbing.  If resources or capacity are limited, rational approaches should be implemented to prioritise high-yield actions, which include: rational use of confirmatory testing, reducing contact tracing to focus only on high-yield contacts, rational use of PPE and hospitalisation and implementing rational criteria for de-isolation. Testing approaches should prioritise vulnerable populations, protection of social and healthcare institutions, including staff.  National surveillance systems should initially aim at rapidly detecting cases and assessing community transmission. As the epidemic progresses, surveillance should monitor the intensity, geographical spread and the impact of the epidemic on the population and healthcare systems and assess the effectiveness of measures in place. In circumstances with capacity shortages and strict implementation of social distancing measures, surveillance should focus on severe acute respiratory infections, sentinel surveillance in outpatient clinics or collection of data through telephone helplines.  A strategic approach based on early and rigorous application of these measures will help reduce the burden and pressure on the healthcare system, and in particular on hospitals, and will allow more time for the testing of therapeutics and vaccine development.

4,chance of (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),3,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/outbreak-novel-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-situation-italy,"Publication Risk assessment

During the course of the day on 22 February, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy. Initial case identification was based on local laboratory confirmations in the affected Region. Further confirmatory testing is being undertaken by the Italian national reference laboratory and extensive contact tracing is being performed. On 22 February, COVID-19 cases were also reported from two other Regions, Piedmont and Veneto. On 23 February Emilia-Romagna also reported cases. Transmission appears to not be first generation transmission from people travelling or returning from an affected area, but seems to have occurred locally. Transmission events have been reported to have occurred in hospitals, with COVID-19 cases identified among healthcare workers and patients. Two deaths among elderly people have been observed. COVID-19 cases have been identified in multiple

municipalities.

The information currently available about the different COVID-19 clusters of cases in four Regions in Italy is limited. The situation is dynamically evolving, with more cases expected in the coming days. The risk assessment for the EU/EEA might change when more data become available. The clusters are currently limited to a few Regions in northern Italy. No close contacts or other related cases have been reported to be linked to other European countries.

The risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people from the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered to be low to moderate.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

All previously reported cases in the EU/EEA and UK have clearly established epidemiological links; contact tracing measures have been in place to contain further spread. Extraordinary public health measures have been implemented in northern Italy and strong efforts are being made to identify, isolate and test contacts in order to contain the outbreak. The probability of further transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded because a high level of uncertainties with several unpredictable factors and a situation that is still evolving.

The possibility of new introductions from other countries outside China in the EU/EEA appears to be increasing as the number of non EU/EEA countries reporting cases keeps going up. Among the increasing number of countries reporting COVID-19 cases are Israel, Lebanon, Iran, and Egypt, while the number of cases in countries outside of China (South Korea, Japan) has been increasing over the last few days. This also increases the possibility of cases being introduced from other countries outside China by travellers to the EU/EEA.

The impact of sustained transmission in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, given that the reported case severity is high among these groups.

The risk of the occurrence of similar clusters, similar to the ones in Italy, associated with COVID-19 in other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently considered to be moderate to high.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

The current event in Italy indicates that local transmission may have resulted in several clusters for which an epidemiological link to areas where ongoing transmission is presumed, was not apparent. The accumulated evidence from clusters reported in the EU/EEA and the UK indicates that once imported, the virus causing COVID19 can transmit rapidly. This may emanate from cases with mild symptoms that do not provoke healthcare-seeking behaviour. The increases in cases and the number of countries outside China reporting those cases increases the potential routes of importation of the infection into the EU/EEA and the UK.

The impact of such clusters in the EU/EEA would be moderate to high, especially if hospitals were affected and a large number of healthcare workers had to be isolated. The impact on vulnerable groups within affected hospitals or healthcare facilities is considered to be severe, in particular for the elderly.

The rigorous public health measures that were implemented immediately after identifying the Italian COVID-19 cases will reduce the impact of such outbreaks as well as the further spread.

The risk for people from the EU/EEA and the UK travelling/resident in areas with presumed community transmission is currently high.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

The overall number of reported cases in areas with community transmission is high or increasing. However, there are significant uncertainties regarding transmissibility and under-detection, particularly among mild or asymptomatic cases.

For travellers/residents, the impact of one or more infections is considered high, especially for elderly populations with comorbidities, because the reported case severity is high in these groups. The impact will also depend on the capacity and availability of healthcare during the epidemic.

The risk for healthcare systems capacity in the EU/EEA and the UK during the peak of the influenza season is low to moderate.

This assessment is based on the following factors:

As the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK remains low, the probability of widespread infection remains low during the peak of the 2019–2020 influenza season. The majority of countries reported widespread influenza activity for week 7/2020, but the proportion of specimens tested positive in sentinel surveillance is slightly decreasing; some EU/EEA countries might have already moved past the peak period of high influenza circulation: see https://flunewseurope.org.

If a significant increase in COVID-19 cases were to coincide with a high level of influenza activity, the potential impact on healthcare systems would be moderate to high. The increased number of cases would require additional resources for testing, case management, surveillance, and contact tracing. Increased transmission could result in further pressure on healthcare systems. This situation would be exacerbated should a substantial number of healthcare workers become infected.","   Skip to main content            Global Navigation   Other sites:   ECDC    European Antibiotic Awareness Day    ESCAIDE - Scientific conference    Eurosurveillance journal    EVIP - Vaccination portal                            European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   An agency of the European Union                          Main Navigation     Home     All topics: A to Z    Secondary Navigation    News & events    Publications & data    Tools    About us     Search    Search  Search    Search Search                    Home  Publications & data  Threat assessment brief: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation in Italy                   Publications & data                Threat assessment brief: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation in Italy    Publication Risk assessment   23 Feb 2020        Twitter     Facebook     Linked In     Mail      During the course of the day on 22 February, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy.

4,chance of (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/man-given-almost-zero-chance-of-covid-19-survival-due-to-return-home,"A woman allowed to see her husband to say goodbye when told he had “almost zero chance” of surviving coronavirus, said he could shortly be home after more than 11 weeks in intensive care, much of it on a ventilator.

Sue Martin, 49, from Cardiff, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that her husband, Mal, 58, had survived against all the odds, but the family was now preparing for the unknown ahead.

Mal, the chairman of a recruitment firm, was admitted to hospital on 29 March. In an interview in April, Sue, a civil servant, told of the emotional moment she and their children Hana, 16, and William, 14, all wearing personal protective equipment, were given 10 minutes to say their goodbyes.

He is now expected to be discharged within days, but the physical toll of the virus could mean that he will lose some fingers, and he may require long-term dialysis.

Doctors were “just completely astounded” at his determination and focus, she said. “Everybody in the hospital has been saying to him they did not expect him to survive. We were told he was slipping away, that he was as close to death as anybody they had seen that had then managed to survive.”

She and the children had discussed his potential funeral. “To think we were at that stage, and it was almost so hopeless, and to now talk about him coming home, well we just can’t believe it. We’re just so incredibly grateful,” she said.

Unable to see him in person, they initially saw him through FaceTime, but stopped because it was too depressing “to see him just lying there, lifeless, and obviously unresponsive”.

When he eventually came out of his coma, “it was a one-way conversation”.

“He was so weak, all he could do was blink, or perhaps raise an eyebrow, or nod. He couldn’t even move his arms, or hands, or legs, in the beginning. He had so much muscle wastage from being on a ventilator for so long.”

After a while, with a voice setting fitted to his tracheotomy, he was able to respond. “The day we were able to hear his voice was just incredible,” she said.

“Every time we see him now, it is more like him, he is just a very thinner, weaker version of himself. He’s just now realising how close he came, and what we went through as well, which is quite difficult I think for him to process.”

Several fingers and his thumbs are “all shrivelled up” as result of medication given to keep him alive. “It’s a small price to pay if he requires some amputations of fingers and thumbs,” she said. He might always suffer from breathlessness, and could require dialysis long term. She has been told his hallucinations may last for years.

“So we will continue to take each day as it comes. Him actually being here physically with us will make a massive difference. And we will just do whatever we need to do to get him to the best place we can get him to.

“But we will all be very different. But hopefully there will be some positives to come from it and we will just continue to be as positive as possible and support him in the best way we can.”","       Skip to main content            The Guardian - Back to home          Support The Guardian  Available for everyone, funded by readers   Contribute       Subscribe       Contribute           Search jobs           Sign in         My account     Account overview    Profile    Emails & marketing    Settings    Help     Comments & replies                 Sign out          Search            switch to the International edition     switch to the UK edition     switch to the US edition     switch to the Australia edition     current edition: International edition     News    Opinion    Sport    Culture    Lifestyle          Show More          News    Coronavirus    World news    UK news    Environment    Science    Global development    Football    Tech    Business    Obituaries       Opinion    The Guardian view    Columnists    Cartoons    Opinion videos    Letters       Sport    Football    Cricket    Rugby union    Tennis    Cycling    F1    Golf    US sports       Culture    Books    Music    TV & radio    Art & design    Film    Games    Classical    Stage       Lifestyle    Fashion    Food    Recipes    Love & sex    Health & fitness    Home & garden    Women    Men    Family    Travel    Money               What term do you want to search?

He had so much muscle wastage from being on a ventilator for so long.”  After a while, with a voice setting fitted to his tracheotomy, he was able to respond. “The day we were able to hear his voice was just incredible,” she said.  “Every time we see him now, it is more like him, he is just a very thinner, weaker version of himself. He’s just now realising how close he came, and what we went through as well, which is quite difficult I think for him to process.”  Several fingers and his thumbs are “all shrivelled up” as result of medication given to keep him alive. “It’s a small price to pay if he requires some amputations of fingers and thumbs,” she said. He might always suffer from breathlessness, and could require dialysis long term. She has been told his hallucinations may last for years.     “So we will continue to take each day as it comes. Him actually being here physically with us will make a massive difference. And we will just do whatever we need to do to get him to the best place we can get him to.  “But we will all be very different.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

None selected Select countries  Case fatality rate In this section How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time? The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.            Click to open interactive version             Click to open interactive version      Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Current data across countries suggests that the elderly are most at risk   It’s helpful to estimate the risk of death across a population – the average IFR, the chance of death if a random person in the country were to catch the disease, which we discussed above . It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.

The case fatality rate What does the data on deaths and cases tell us about the mortality risk of COVID-19? To understand the risks and respond appropriately we would also want to know the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who catches the disease will die from it. We look into this question in more detail here and explain that this requires us to know – or estimate – the number of total cases and the final number of deaths for a given infected population. Because these are not known, we discuss what the current data can and can not tell us about the risk of death ( here ). How did confirmed deaths and cases change over time?

Total confirmed deaths vs. cases [scatterplot]      The case fatality rate is simply the ratio of the two metrics shown in the chart above.  The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.  This chart here plots the CFR calculated in just that way.  During an outbreak – and especially when the total number of cases is not known – one has to be very careful in interpreting the CFR . We wrote a detailed explainer on what can and can not be said based on current CFR figures.    What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? In this section Interpreting the case fatality rate The current case fatality rate of COVID-19 Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases There is a straightforward question that most people would like answered. If someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is that person to die? This question is simple, but surprisingly hard to answer. Here we explain why that is. We’ll discuss the “case fatality rate”, the “crude mortality rate”, and the “infection fatality rate”, and why they’re all different. The key point is that the “case fatality rate”, the most commonly discussed measure of the risk of dying, is not the answer to the question, for two reasons. One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died. These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death. The case fatality rate (CFR) In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed. 1 This measure is sometimes called case fatality risk or case fatality ratio, or CFR. But this is not the same as the risk of death for an infected person – even though, unfortunately, journalists often suggest that it is. It is relevant and important, but far from the whole story. The CFR is very easy to calculate. You take the number of people who have died, and you divide it by the total number of people diagnosed with the disease. So if 10 people have died, and 100 people have been diagnosed with the disease, the CFR is [10 / 100], or 10%. But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure, which like the CFR gives something that might sound like the answer to the question that we asked earlier: if someone is infected, how likely are they to die? But, just as with CFR, it is actually very different. The crude mortality rate – sometimes called the crude death rate – measures the probability that any individual in the population will die from the disease; not just those who are infected, or are confirmed as being infected. It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population . For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%, even if only 100 people had been diagnosed with the disease. This difference is important: unfortunately, people sometimes confuse case fatality rates with crude death rates. A common example is the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. One estimate, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that that pandemic killed 50 million people. 2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. This means the crude mortality rate was 2.7%. But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with Spanish flu. If the crude mortality rate really was 2.7%, then the case fatality rate was much higher – it would be the percentage of people who died after being diagnosed with the disease. [We look at the global death count of this pandemic and others here .] What we want to know isn’t the case fatality rate : it’s the infection fatality rate Before we look at what the CFR does tell us about the mortality risk, it is helpful to see what it doesn’t. Remember the question we asked at the beginning: if someone is infected with COVID-19, how likely is it that they will die? The answer to that question is captured by the infection fatality rate , or IFR. The IFR is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases . If 10 people die of the disease, and 500 actually have it, then the IFR is [10 / 500], or 2%. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 To work out the IFR, we need two numbers: the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. However, as we explain here , the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. That’s partly because not everyone with COVID-19 is tested. 8 , 9  We may be able to estimate the total number of cases and use it to calculate the IFR – and researchers do this. But the total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be accurately calculated. And, despite what some media reports imply, the CFR is not the same as – or, probably, even similar to – the IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why. Interpreting the case fatality rate In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. The case fatality rate isn’t constant: it changes with the context Sometimes journalists talk about the CFR as if it’s a single, steady number, an unchanging fact about the disease. This is a particular bad example from the New York Times in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s not a biological constant; instead, it reflects the severity of the disease in a particular context, at a particular time, in a particular population.  The probability that someone dies from a disease doesn’t just depend on the disease itself, but also on the treatment they receive, and on the patient’s own ability to recover from it. This means that the CFR can decrease or increase over time, as responses change; and that it can vary by location and by the characteristics of the infected population, such as age, or sex. For instance, older populations would expect to see a higher CFR from COVID-19 than younger ones. The CFR of COVID-19 differs by location, and has changed during the early period of the outbreak The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. You can see that in the chart below, first published in the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , in February 2020. 10 It shows the CFR values for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. You can see that in the earliest stages of the outbreak the CFR was much higher: 17.3% across China as a whole (in yellow) and greater than 20% in the centre of the outbreak, in Wuhan (in blue). But in the weeks that followed, the CFR declined, reaching as low as 0.7% for patients who first showed symptoms after February 1st. The WHO says that that is because “the standard of care has evolved over the course of the outbreak”. You can also see that the CFR was different in different places. By 1st February, the CFR in Wuhan was still 5.8% while it was 0.7% across the rest of China. This shows that what we said about the CFR generally – that it changes from time to time and place to place – is true for the CFR of COVID-19 specifically. When we talk about the CFR of a disease, we need to talk about it in a specific time and place – the CFR in Wuhan on 23rd February, or in Italy on 4th March – rather than as a single unchanging value. Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020) 11 There are two reasons why the case fatality rate does not reflect the risk of death If the case fatality rate does not tell us the risk of death for someone infected with the disease, what does it tell us? And how does the CFR compare with the actual (unknown) probability? There are two reasons why we would expect the CFR not to represent the real risk. One of them would tend to make the CFR an overestimate – the other would tend to make it an underestimate. When there are people who have the disease but are not diagnosed, the CFR will overestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, we think there are many undiagnosed people. As we saw above, in our discussion on the difference between total and confirmed cases ( here ), we do not know the number of total cases. Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. And whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there are 500 real cases, then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases . This of course assumes that there is not also significant undercounting in the number of deaths; it’s plausible that some deaths are missed or go unreported, but we’d expect the magnitude of undercounting to be less than for cases. Importantly, this means that the number of tests carried out affects the CFR – you can only confirm a case by testing a patient. So when we compare the CFR between different countries, the differences do not only reflect rates of mortality, but also differences in the scale of testing efforts. When some people are currently sick and will die of the disease, but have not died yet, the CFR will underestimate the true risk of death. With COVID-19, there are many who are currently sick and will die, but have not yet died.  Or, they may die from the disease but be listed as having died from something else. In ongoing outbreaks, people who are currently sick will eventually die from the disease. This means that they are currently counted as a case, but will eventually be counted as a death too. This means the CFR right now is an underestimate of what it will be when the disease has run its course. With the COVID-19 outbreak, it can take between two to eight weeks for people to go from first symptoms to death, according to data from early cases (we discuss this here ). 12  This is not a problem once an outbreak has finished. Afterwards, the total number of deaths will be known, and we can use it to calculate the CFR. But during an outbreak, we need to be careful with how to interpret the CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) of a large number of cases is still unknown. This is a common source for misinterpretation of a rising CFR in the earlier stages of an outbreak. 13 This is what happened during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003: the CFR was initially reported to be 3-5% during the early stages of the outbreak, but had risen to around 10% by the end. 14 , 15 This is not just a problem for statisticians: it had real negative consequences for our understanding of the outbreak. The low numbers that were published initially resulted in an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak. And the rise of the CFR over time gave the wrong impression that SARS was becoming more deadly over time. These errors made it harder to come up with the right response. The current case fatality rate of COVID-19   We should stress again that there is no single figure of CFR for any particular disease. The CFR varies by location, and is typically changing over time.  As this paper shows 16 , CFRs vary widely between countries, from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy. But it says that this is not necessarily an accurate comparison of the true likelihood that someone with COVID-19 will die of it.  We do not know how many cases are asymptomatic versus symptomatic, or whether the same criteria for testing are being applied between countries. Without better and more standardised criteria for testing and for the recording of deaths, the real mortality rate is unknown. As the  paper says, to understand the differences in CFR and how they should guide decision-making, we need better data.  But if we’re careful to acknowledge its limitations, CFR can help us to better understand the severity of the disease and what we should do about it.  This chart shows how these early CFR values compare. You can see the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (on the x-axis, going across) versus the total number of deaths (on the y-axis, going up).  The grey lines show a range of CFR values – from 0.25% to 10%.  Where each country lies indicates its CFR – for instance, if a country lies along the 2% line, its current confirmed cases and death figures indicate it has a CFR of 2%.  The second chart shows how the CFR has changed over time in countries that have had over 100 confirmed cases.  We have excluded countries which still have a relatively small number of confirmed cases, because CFR is a particularly poor metric to understand mortality risk with a small sample size.  We see this if we look at the trajectory of cases and deaths in Iran: on February 24th it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths, an implausible CFR of 100%. With time its CFR begins to fall, as the number of confirmed cases increases. By the time it has seen hundreds of cases, the CFR drops to around the level seen in other countries.

It helps us know the severity of an outbreak.  But during an outbreak, it’s also crucial to know which groups within a population are most at risk. If we know which sections of society are most likely to die, or suffer other serious consequences, then that allows us to direct our resources towards the most vulnerable, who need them the most.  In the chart below, we see a breakdown of the CFR by age group across various countries who have made demographic data on confirmed cases and deaths available. It shows very large differences of the CFR by age.  This data is based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each age group as reported by national agencies. The figures come from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February; Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) as of 24th March; and the Italian National Institute of Health, as presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March. 17 , 18  Again it’s important to stress that the CFR simply represents the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. It does not tell us the true risk of death, which ( as we say above ) is much harder to estimate. The CFR changes over time, and differences between countries do not necessarily reflect real differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. Instead, they may reflect differences in the extent of testing, or the stage a country is in its trajectory through the outbreak.  For many infectious diseases young children are most at risk. For instance, in the case of malaria, the majority of deaths (57% globally) are in children under five. The same was true for the largest pandemic in recorded history: During the ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918, children and young adults were at the greatest risk from the pandemic (we write more about this in the article here ).  For COVID-19 cases the opposite seems to be true. The elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus.  It may not simply be that the older you get, the more at risk you are, though. As we show in the next section , the CFR for people with underlying health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases or diabetes – is higher than for those without. Elderly people are more likely to have those conditions, which is likely to be part of the reason why the elderly are most at risk from COVID-19.    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age group across countries. 19 , 20    Case fatality rate of COVID-19 by preexisting health conditions Early data from China suggests that those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk The chart here shows the case fatality rate for populations within China based on their health status or underlying health condition. This is based on the same data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as we discussed in the section on age . 21 This analysis was based on recorded deaths and cases in China in the period up to February 11th 2020. The researchers found that the CFR for those with an underlying health condition is much higher than for those without. For instance, more than 10% of people with a cardiovascular disease , and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, died. Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer were all risk factors as well, as we see in the chart. By comparison, the CFR was 0.9% – more than ten times lower – for those without a preexisting health condition. Above we saw that the elderly are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. As we said there, that might be partly explained by the fact that they are also most likely to have underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes; these health conditions make it more difficult to recover from the COVID-19 infection. Case fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to other diseases How does the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 compare to other virus outbreaks and diseases? Once again, we should stress what we discussed above. One has to understand the measurement challenges and the definitions to interpret estimates of the CFR for COVID-19, particularly those relating to an ongoing outbreak. As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively. 22 The US seasonal flu has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% – lower than the current CFR for COVID-19. 23 Sources of data shown in the table: SARS-CoV: Venkatesh, S. & Memish, Z.A.

Here we present an upper and lower estimate for the 2018-19 flu season. These two figures reflect whether we look at the percentage of deaths out of the number of symptomatic illnesses (giving us 0.1%), or the number of medical visits (giving us 0.2%). In the traditional calculation of CFR, we would tend to focus on the number of symptomatic illnesses . This is analogous to the number of confirmed cases, on which the COVID-19 figures are based. However, the US CDC derives these figures based on disease outbreak modelling which attempts to account for underreporting – you can read more about how it derives its annual flu figures here .  This means that some of the biases which tend to underestimate the actual number of cases have been corrected for. This is not the case for the COVID-19 figures, so it may be an unfair comparison.  Looking at estimates based on the number of medical visits may discount from the US seasonal flu data many of the kind of mild cases that may have been missed in the COVID-19 confirmed cases. However, this is likely to skew the comparison slightly in the other direction: we know that not all of the confirmed cases included in COVID-19 figures were of a severity such that they would have received a medical visit in the absence of the heightened surveillance of the outbreak.  So, here we present both figures of the US seasonal flu figures: the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, and those based on medical visits. It’s likely that the fairest comparison to COVID-19 lies somewhere between these two values.  You can find the data for the reported cases, medical visits and deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) here . The CDC reports 35,520,883 symptomatic cases of influenza in the US and 34,157 deaths from the flu. To calculate the CFR based on symptomatic illnesses, we divide the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases and find a case fatality rate of 0.1%.{ref}(0.1%=[34,157 / 35,520,883] * 100) Wordpress  Edit Page Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.
