Thanks to nimble collaboration, the team was able to culture the virus from two clinical specimens in a Level 3 containment facility.

“We need key tools to develop solutions to this pandemic. While the immediate response is crucial, longer-term solutions come from essential research into this novel virus,” said Dr. Samira Mubareka, microbiologist and infectious diseases physician at Sunnybrook.

The isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, evolution and clinical shedding.

“Researchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,” said Dr. Rob Kozak, clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook. “It demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate.”

Dr. Arinjay Banerjee, NSERC post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University, said he knows the collaboration won’t stop there.

“Now that we have isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we can share this with other researchers and continue this teamwork,” he said. “The more viruses that are made available in this way, the more we can learn, collaborate and share.”

Congratulations to the researchers from these three Canadian institutions: Dr. Samira Mubareka and Dr. Rob Kozak of Sunnybrook and University of Toronto; Dr. Arinjay Banerjee and Dr. Karen Mossman of McMaster University.

With gratitude to the CL3 team and Biosafety Officers.

https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-and-cancer-hijack-the-same-parts-in-human-cells-to-spread-and-our-team-identified-existing-cancer-drugs-that-could-fight-covid-19-139955,"Most antivirals in use today target parts of an invading virus itself. Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – has proven hard to kill. But viruses rely on cellular mechanisms in human cells to help them spread, so it should be possible to change an aspect of a person’s body to prevent that and slow down the virus enough to allow the immune system to fight the invader off.

I am a quantitative biologist, and my lab built a map of how the coronavirus uses human cells. We used that map to find already existing drugs that could be repurposed to fight COVID-19 and have been working with an international group of researchers called the QBI Coronavirus Research Group to see if the drugs we identified showed any promise. Many have.

For years, researchers have suspected that kinases – biological control switches that viruses use to take over cells – could be targeted to fight infections. Over the last few months, we built a second, more detailed map looking specifically for the kinases that the coronavirus is hijacking.

Using this map, we identified a few already existing cancer drugs which alter the function of the kinases that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks, and began testing them in coronavirus-infected cells. The results of these early tests are promising enough that we are working with some groups and have already begun human clinical trials.

Kinases in disease and as drug targets

Kinases are proteins found in every cell of our body. There are 518 human kinases, and they act as major control hubs for virtually all processes in the body. They are able to add a small marker – a process called phosphorylation – to other proteins and thus change how, if and when a phosphorylated protein can do its work.

For example, if a cell is preparing to grow – say to heal a cut on your finger – specific kinases will turn on and start telling proteins involved in cell growth what to do. Many cancers are caused by overactive kinases leading to uncontrolled cell growth, and drugs that slow kinases down can be highly effective at treating cancer.

Kinases are central players in cellular function as well as in most diseases, so researchers and pharmaceutical companies have studied them in great detail.

Kinases are also fairly easy to target with drugs because of how they add phosphorylation markers to proteins. Researchers have developed a huge number of drugs, particularly cancer drugs, that work by essentially throwing a wrench into the mechanics of specific kinases in order to stop cell growth.

So what does this have to do with the coronavirus? Well, viruses and cancer actually have more in common than you might think. Cancer is essentially a malfunctioning of cellular machinery that causes runaway cell growth.

Viruses also change the function of cellular machinery – albeit on purpose – but instead of causing cell growth, the machinery is repurposed to produce more viruses. Not surprisingly, viruses take control over many kinases to do this.

Coronavirus at the controls

This idea – that SARS-CoV-2 is using kinases to hijack cellular machinery – is why we wanted to build a map of every kinase that is taken over by the coronavirus. Any virus–kinase interaction could be a potential target for drugs.

To do this, we first infected green monkey cells – which are fairly good surrogates for human cells when it comes to virus infection – with SARS-CoV-2. We then ground up these infected cells and used a device called a mass spectrometer to see which proteins were phosphorylated in these infected cells. We then did the same thing with healthy cells.

It is impossible to actually see which kinases are activated at any time, but since each kinase can attach phosphorylation markers to only a few specific proteins, researchers can look at the phosphorylated proteins to determine what kinases are active at any time.

We made two lists: one list of phosphorylated proteins in healthy cells and one list of phosphorylated proteins in infected cells. We then compared the two, and by looking at the differences between the infected and uninfected lists, we were able to determine which kinases the coronavirus uses to reproduce.

Because researchers still don’t fully understand what all 518 human kinases do, we were able to look for effects in only 97 of the ones we know most about. But that turned out to be more than enough. Of those 97 kinases, we found 49 that the virus affects.

Some of the more interesting ones include Casein Kinase 2, which is involved in controlling how a cell is shaped. We also identified several kinases that work together in what is called the p38/MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway responds to and controls our body’s inflammation reaction. It is possible these kinases could be involved in the cytokine storm – a dangerous immune system overreaction – that some patients with severe COVID-19 experience.

While identifying the kinases involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication, we were also able to learn a lot about how the virus changes our bodies. For example, CK2 becomes much more active during the course of coronavirus infection and causes the growth of little tubes that extend from the surface of the cell. Under a microscope, it looks as if the cell has a full head of hair. We think SARS-CoV-2 might be using these long cell outgrowths – called filopodia – as viral highways to get new viruses closer to neighboring cells, thereby making infection easier.

Kinases inhibitors in the lab and clinical trials

Learning more about the virus’s function is interesting for a biologist like me and could be useful down the road, but the ultimate goal of our project was to find drugs to treat COVID-19.

Once we knew which kinases SARS-CoV-2 uses to replicate and the proteins they change, we looked through a database of around 250 kinase-inhibiting drugs to see if any of them targeted the kinases used by the virus. To increase our chances, we also looked for drugs that hit some of the proteins the kinases act on. And sure enough, we found some.

There are 87 existing drugs that change the kinase-controlled pathways used by the coronavirus. Most of these drugs are already approved for human use or are currently in clinical trials to treat cancer, and could be quickly repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients.

With these leads, our collaborators in New York and Paris tested the effect of 68 of those drugs on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several of these were effective in killing the virus in cells. A few that we are especially excited about – silmitasertib, gilteritinib, ralimetinib, apilimod and dinaciclib – are either approved for treatment, in clinical testing or under preclinical development for various diseases.

Silmitasertib stops Casein Kinase 2, the kinase that causes cells to grow the virus spreading filopodia tubes. As soon as the company that makes silmitasertib heard this news, they announced that they wanted to test the drug against COVID-19 in the clinic.

Drugs hitting kinase pathways have been on the radar of researchers as potential powerful antivirals for years, but none have come to fruition. By looking to this new area of drug applications and using our new mapping approach, our team has added dozens of drugs to the growing list of potential tools to help fight this pandemic.

It is still too early to say whether any of these will work to treat COVID-19 in patients, but the more chances we have, the better.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-28/world-records-ten-millionth-case-of-coronavirus-covid-19/12400746,"The world has now recorded its 10 millionth person infected with the novel coronavirus, 180 days after the first cases were reported in Wuhan, China.

As the virus spread throughout the world this year, it reached every continent apart from Antarctica, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic.

Infections have now been reported in more than 210 countries and territories.

And coronavirus has now been officially ruled responsible for close to half a million deaths worldwide.

The road to 10 million

From a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan reported to the World Health Organisation on December 31, the virus spread fast.

By January the virus began to spread throughout the country, eventually reaching all of China's 31 provinces.

The country peaked with almost 6,500 new infections reported in a day in mid-February.

The reproduction rate of the virus was severely curtailed by harsh lockdowns across the sprawling metropolis of Wuhan, alongside social distancing rules and increased testing.

On Sunday, China's active confirmed cases have dropped below 1,000.

And while the virus has officially caused the deaths of 4,641 people in the country, since late February the vast majority of global COVID-19 cases have been elsewhere.

The virus spreads outside China

The first case outside China was discovered in Thailand on January 15, before quickly spreading to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.

Remarkably, Thailand has only recorded 58 coronavirus deaths to date in the pandemic.

But in March, Europe emerged as the virus's global epicentre.

The continent reported half the world's new infections for the first time on March 5, and at its worst was detecting more than 80 per cent of the daily figures.

It forced hundreds of millions of people across the continent into lockdown as governments attempted to prevent the spread of the virus.

Two large clusters of the virus first overwhelmed the health system in northern Italy.

But as the virus spread to other parts of the country, the Italian Government instigated regional lockdowns, making life unrecognisable from just weeks earlier.

These were soon extended to a countrywide lockdown, and by the middle of March the country's new cases of coronavirus peaked.

For the last two months, the deaths and infection rates have slowed in Italy, and earlier this month the country reopened its borders and ended regional travel restrictions.

On Saturday, there were only eight COVID-19 deaths reported in Italy, the first time the country had reported a death toll in the single digits since March 1.

Although Russia has become a new hotspot, the virus seems to have reached its peak on the continent, with new confirmed cases and deaths falling in the UK, Italy, Spain and France.

SARS-CoV-2 doesn't respect country borders, and by April there was a new global epicentre: the United States, which remains one of the world's most serious outbreaks to this day.

By April, the virus had spread unchecked in the United States for so long that the number of confirmed cases in just that one country had eclipsed those of Europe.

For more than a month, the United States alone was reporting more than a third of the world's infections.

Hotspots across the developing world

While most of the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 outside China was in developed countries in Europe and North America, the developing world is now feeling the brunt of the virus.

Many countries in hotspots like Latin America, south Asia and Africa will be dealing with the virus for a long time to come.

The WHO declared South America a new epicentre in late May, and this month Brazil surpassed the United States to have the highest daily infection numbers of any country.

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for his handling of the pandemic as he shuns social distancing and described it as a job-killing measure.

Brazil has already recorded more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 50,000 deaths, while Peru and Chile have had more than 250,000 cases each.

SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading at a much slower rate in Africa, but the WHO has warned the virus is being found outside capital cities, and a lack of testing capacity and supplies are hampering the response.

Egypt, South Africa and Nigeria have reported the most infections in the continent, with South Africa alone accounting for a third of the more than 350,000 confirmed cases.

In South Asia, India has also been hard hit by the virus, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases in the country — the fourth-most worldwide.

Coronavirus isn't slowing down

The rate the virus is spreading is still increasing.

It took 45 days for the world to increase from two million cases to six million.

It took just 28 days to climb another four million.

If the virus doesn't slow down, the world will reach 20 million cases by September.

True death toll expected to be much higher

The true numbers of infections are likely to be far higher than the number of confirmed cases.

Similarly, the true death toll is well understood to be vastly underestimated by the reported figures from each country.

Globally, 5 per cent of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have died.

But that has been driven up by a handful of countries with poor survival rates.

In the chart below, the higher a country appears vertically, the higher the case fatality rate, and the more devastating the virus has been.

The virus has impacted different countries health systems in dramatically different ways.

Yemen, where the virus spread virtually undetected, has the highest case fatality rate in the world.

A bigger contribution to the global fatality rate, however, are the group European countries which were affected very early in the pandemic, including Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom.

In part, those countries' very high fatality rates reflect that their health systems were rapidly overwhelmed by patients and did not have the capacity to treat all the serious infections.

Case fatality rates also tend to be higher where a country has been unable to do enough testing to catch most infections.

Australia's fatality rate is currently 1.3 per cent.","     Skip to main content ABC News Homepage Search More from ABC More from ABC Close menu ABC ABC Home News Radio iview Life More Editorial Policies Read our editorial guiding principles Accessibility Help Contact Us About the ABC Privacy Policy Terms of Use © 2020 ABC Just In Politics World Business Analysis Sport Science Health Arts Fact Check Other News Home How the world got to 10 million coronavirus cases By Casey Briggs and Dan Nancarrow Posted  Yesterday Sun Sunday  28  Jun June  2020 at 9:51am , updated  11 h hours ago Mon Monday  29  Jun June  2020 at 1:13am  The coronavirus has spread to 210 countries and territories around the world.

The virus has impacted different countries health systems in dramatically different ways. Yemen, where the virus spread virtually undetected, has the highest case fatality rate in the world . A bigger contribution to the global fatality rate, however, are the group European countries which were affected very early in the pandemic, including Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. In part, those countries' very high fatality rates reflect that their health systems were rapidly overwhelmed by patients and did not have the capacity to treat all the serious infections. Case fatality rates also tend to be higher where a country has been unable to do enough testing to catch most infections. Australia's fatality rate is currently 1.3 per cent.

To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from nine different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high efficiency MERV-15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transmission by environmental contamination via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. More work is needed to further evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems and to verify effectiveness of building operations mitigation strategies for the protection of building occupants. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present a matter of some urgency for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high-efficiency filtration.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html,"CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings when around people outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.

Cloth face coverings may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.

Cloth face coverings are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.

Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Evidence for Effectiveness of Cloth Face Coverings

Cloth face coverings are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the cloth face covering coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of cloth face coverings is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.

Who Should Wear A Cloth Face Covering?

General public

CDC recommends all people 2 years of age and older﷟ wear a cloth face covering in public settings when around people outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to

COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to wear cloth face coverings in public settings and practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people).

While cloth face coverings are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a cloth face covering may not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible (see below for examples).

People who know or think they might have COVID-19

If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, do not visit public areas. Stay home except to get medical care. As much as possible stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If you need to be around other people or animals, wear a cloth face covering (including in your home).

The cloth face covering helps prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others. It helps keep respiratory droplets contained and from reaching other people.

Caregivers of people with COVID-19

Those caring for someone who is sick with COVID-19 at home or in a non-healthcare setting may also wear a cloth face covering. However, the protective effects—how well the cloth face covering protects healthy people from breathing in the virus—are unknown. To prevent getting sick, caregivers should also continue to practice everyday preventive actions: avoid close contact as much as possible, clean hands often; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.

Who Should Not Wear a Cloth Face Covering

Cloth face coverings should not be worn by:

Children younger than 2 years old

Anyone who has trouble breathing

Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance

Feasibility and Adaptations

CDC recognizes that wearing cloth face coverings may not be possible in every situation or for some people. In some situations, wearing a cloth face covering may exacerbate a physical or mental health condition, lead to a medical emergency, or introduce significant safety concerns. Adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a cloth face covering or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.

For example,

Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing—or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired—may be unable to wear cloth face coverings if they rely on lipreading to communicate. In this situation, consider using a clear face covering. If a clear face covering isn’t available, consider whether you can use written communication, use closed captioning, or decrease background noise to make communication possible while wearing a cloth face covering that blocks your lips.

Some individuals with developmental disabilities, sensory integration concerns or tactile sensitivities, certain mental health conditions, or limited cognitive ability may have a negative reaction to wearing a cloth face covering. These individuals may consult with their healthcare provider as part of the decision to wear a cloth face covering.

Younger children (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be unable to wear a cloth face covering properly, particularly for an extended period of time. Wearing of cloth face coverings may be prioritized at times when it is difficult to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or when standing in line at school). Ensuring proper cloth face covering size and fit and providing children with frequent reminders and education on the importance and proper wear of cloth face coverings may help address these issues.

Individuals should not wear cloth face coverings while engaged in activities that may cause the cloth face covering to become wet, like when swimming at the beach or pool. A wet cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe. For activities like swimming, it is particularly important to maintain physical distance from others when in the water.

Individuals who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a cloth face covering if it causes difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a cloth face covering, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.

Individuals who work in a setting where cloth face coverings may increase the risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns due to introduction of a hazard (for instance, straps getting caught in machinery) may consult with an occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate face covering for their setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or shift meetings, and remove face coverings when social distancing is possible. Find more information here and below.

Cloth face coverings are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. If cloth face coverings cannot be used, make sure to take other measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, including social distancing, frequent hand washing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.

Face Shields

It is not known if face shields provide any benefit as source control to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. Some people may choose to use a face shield when sustained close contact with other people is expected. If face shields are used without a mask, they should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended.

Surgical Masks

Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Cloth face coverings also are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required and available.

Individuals who work in a setting where cloth face coverings may increase the risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns due to introduction of a hazard (for instance, straps getting caught in machinery) may consult with an occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate face covering for their setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or shift meetings, and remove face coverings when social distancing is possible. Find more information here and below.   Cloth face coverings are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. If cloth face coverings cannot be used, make sure to take other measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, including social distancing, frequent hand washing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.  Face Shields  It is not known if face shields provide any benefit as source control to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. Some people may choose to use a face shield when sustained close contact with other people is expected. If face shields are used without a mask, they should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended .  Surgical Masks  Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Cloth face coverings also are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required and available.
