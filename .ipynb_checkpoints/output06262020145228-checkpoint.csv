We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below.

People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than other children.

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contract tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear cloth face coverings

Cloth face coverings should be worn over the nose and mouth. Cloth face coverings are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a cloth face covering helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:

Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Talk to a healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about getting an extra supply (i.e., more than 30 days) of prescription medicines, if possible, to reduce your trips to the pharmacy.

of prescription and non-prescription medicines.

1,it is more risky (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),2,https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/flu-sick-days.html,"These tips can help people with diabetes prepare for getting sick and take care of themselves if they do become ill.

Like everyone, people with diabetes can get sick even when trying their best to prevent it. So being prepared and knowing what to do if you get sick is very important. There are several things you can do now, but also talk to your doctor about the best way to handle being sick if it happens. Visit these pages for more information:

These tips can help you take care of yourself if you get sick.

Prepare Now Before Getting Sick

Make sure you have insulin, other diabetes medicines, and easy-to-fix foods in your home, enough for several weeks or longer:

Medicines and supplies

Milk of magnesia Medicine to control diarrhea Antacid Pain reliever Thermometer Suppositories to treat vomiting



Foods

Sports drinks Juice boxes Canned soup Regular gelatin Regular soft drinks Instant cooked cereals Crackers Instant pudding Unsweetened applesauce

If you can’t eat meals, you will need to eat or drink about 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours, such as 1½ cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1½ cup of fruit juice.

If You Get Sick

If you do get sick, your blood sugar can be hard to manage. You may not be able to eat or drink as much as usual, which can affect blood sugar levels.

Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar more often when you’re sick. That’s because when your body releases hormones to fight the illness, those hormones can also raise your blood sugar levels and increase how much insulin you need. This is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes since they depend on insulin to live.

When your body doesn’t have enough insulin, it starts breaking down fat as fuel, which produces ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can cause diabetic ketoacidosisexternal icon, or DKA. DKA is very serious and can cause a coma or even death.

If you think you may have DKA, use an over-the-counter kit to test your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, call your doctor right away. You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment.

Follow these additional steps when you’re sick even if your blood sugar is within your target range:

Continue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual .

. Test your blood sugar every 4 hours and keep track of the results.

Drink extra calorie-free liquids*, and try to eat as you normally would.

Weigh yourself every day. Losing weight without trying is a sign of high blood glucose.

Check your temperature every morning and evening. A fever may be a sign of infection.

*Drink plenty of fluids – 4 to 6 ounces every half-hour – to prevent dehydration. You may also need to drink beverages with sugar if you cannot get 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours from other food choices. Drink small portions of these sweet beverages to keep your blood sugar from getting too high.","                           Skip directly to site content  Skip directly to page options  Skip directly to A-Z link         Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

2,it is more riskier (coronavirus | covid | pandemic),1,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52849691,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People sunbathing on the beach by Bournemouth pier as lockdown eases

Relaxing lockdown is a risk because levels of the coronavirus are still ""very high"", one of the government's top science advisers says.

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait.

The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings.

One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May.

Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.

'Little time for stringent measures'

""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.

Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases.

They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase.

Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus.

But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.

The minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, have been released alongside a series of scientific reports.

Normally the details of the meetings - which include chief science adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - remain secret until after an emergency is over.

However, the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic has led to demands for more openness and the creation of alternative scientific bodies such as ""Independent Sage"".

The documents also show that only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick.

This comes as testing and contact tracing will require anyone who comes into close contact with an infected person to isolate for 14 days, even if they do not become sick.

Behavioural scientists advising government ""strongly recommend"" monitoring how well people were keeping to the rules.

Sage documents showed keeping the R number below one (the point at which the epidemic starts to grow again) would require 80% of contacts to be found within 48 hours.

The scientists agreed that social distancing would need to be maintained even if test and trace was effective.

'Taking a risk'

However, the government's testing tsar said it would be ""very difficult"" to get the results of home tests in less than 48 hours, never mind find their contacts. Tests at drive-through centres are faster.

Prof Edmunds said: ""With untested 'test and trace' we are taking some risk here.""

And he warned that even if test and trace was successful, easing restrictions would keep cases at 8,000 a day and lead to around 80 deaths a day.

Contact tracing starts when somebody tests positive. There is disagreement between Sage scientists with some arguing it should start when symptoms are reported, to increase the speed of the process. Others argue ""false alarms"" could discourage people from complying with the instruction to isolate.

The documents also showed:

On March 13, just before the government changed strategy, ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak""

The advice said neighbourhood or local lockdowns could undermine national measures or lead to a significant issue of disorder.

Even if every adult with a smartphone had the contact tracing app, it would not identify more than 50% of contacts

In mid-Feb, Sage said a ""lack of data from China continues to hamper understanding""

The PM's top adviser Dominic Cummings attended six out of the 34 meetings

Hairdressers and other ""personal care services"" should not reopen soon as they ""typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission""

The risk from attending large events is no higher than small ones because ""close contact"" is the biggest risk

Family gatherings are ""particularly high risk"" and religious services with high levels of physical contact are ""higher risk""

Since April 23, Sage has called for routine testing of all healthcare staff and on 7 May said this should take place even when there are no symptoms

Modellers disagree on the impact of moving into ""phase 2"" including some children going to school, with some worried it will bring the R number above 1

Sir Patrick said: ""During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.

""Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why it's important we don't wait to publish minutes and evidence.""

Prof John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to lift lockdown and that ""many"" scientists would wait. The warning comes as Sage, the group of scientists advising government, publish details of their confidential meetings. One meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May. Instead, estimates by the Office for National Statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures don't include cases in care homes or hospitals.     'Little time for stringent measures' ""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,"" Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, agreed that measures were being lifted too early, writing on Twitter that the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased. Newly-published Sage documents also warned of the dangers of having high numbers of cases. They say this would ""give little time to re-impose more stringent measures"" if the infection rate (the R-number) started to increase. Disease modellers feeding into Sage discussions said having high levels of the virus could allow restrictions to be eased as more people would develop immunity to the virus. But that would ""result in tens of thousands of direct deaths"" and could not be achieved by autumn without intensive care units being overwhelmed.      A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?
