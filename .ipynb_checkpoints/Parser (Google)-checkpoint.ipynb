As new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations soared to alarming new levels across the United States , the governors of several hard-hit states — including Texas, Florida and Arizona — paused their reopening plans. Nationally, 39,327 new infections were reported by state health departments Thursday, surpassing the previous record set just one day earlier. Texas alone reported a record 5,996 new cases (along with a record high for coronavirus hospitalizations), and the state’s rolling average has jumped by 340 percent since Memorial Day. “Literally, there’s been an explosion in the number of covid-19 patients,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) told a Lubbock TV station, noting that the “massive increase in spread” has struck small communities and big cities alike. Houston in particular faces a mounting crisis at hospitals, where intensive care unit beds are filling fast. Here are some significant developments: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Robert Redfield warned Thursday that the actual number of coronavirus cases in the United States is probably 10 times higher than what officials have confirmed through testing. More than 2.4 million infections have been reported nationwide, and the death toll has surpassed 122,000. The White House coronavirus task force will hold its first news briefing in nearly two months Friday. Although President Trump frequently spearheaded briefings in the past, Vice President Pence, who heads the task force, will lead Friday’s event. Joe Biden said that if he were president, he would mandate that every American wear a mask in public. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court late Thursday to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, even though thousands more Americans have signed up for Obamacare since the pandemic began. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) denounced the move as an “act of unfathomable cruelty.” The Trump administration is weighing a new testing strategy as coronavirus cases mount: testing groups of people together. The World Health Organization said the virus could once again “ push health systems to the brink ” in Europe if new case numbers continue to grow. The dire warning came after 30 countries reported increases in the last two weeks.

June 26, 2020 at 7:50 AM EDT How France’s skittishness about collecting data on race affects its coronavirus response PARIS — Karim Allouache felt sick about two days after France’s municipal elections in March, when he ran to represent the Paris suburb of Bondy. His symptoms started as fever and fatigue, but nothing extreme. Then he was in the hospital, where doctors induced a coma and put him on a ventilator for more than three weeks. Now recovering, Allouache assumes he must have contracted the coronavirus while campaigning. Indeed, the poor and multiracial communities north of the capital have been hit especially hard by the virus, with the department of Seine Saint Denis recording a 120 percent increase in deaths compared with the same period last year. But Allouache and others say that understanding why has been hindered by France’s skittishness about collecting data on race and ethnicity. While the United States and Britain have found that their racial minorities are dying disproportionately of covid-19, the French government has not conducted that sort of analysis. Critics say France may be limiting its ability to identify and protect vulnerable populations, especially in the event of a second wave of the pandemic. “For me, I dream of ethnic statistics,” Allouache said. “We are scared of the reality.” Read more here . By James McAuley AD AD June 26, 2020 at 7:36 AM EDT London police chief vows to crack down on illegal parties after more than 20 officers are attacked and injured London police vowed Friday to crack down on illegal parties, after several gatherings sparked confrontations between violent revelers and officers over the last two days. “It’s hot, some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, and some are plain violent,” London Police Commissioner Cressida Dick was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency . “We’ve seen large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families’ health, wanting to have large parties.” More than 20 officers were attacked and injured in London on Wednesday when they tried to break up an illegal party in the south of the capital. More attacks on officers were reported Thursday night. Almost 140 officers were injured over the last three weeks in London while responding to protests or parties, according to city’s police commissioner. The violent confrontations come as coronavirus case numbers in the United Kingdom are on the decline and England is set to reopen its pubs by July 4 . Mass gatherings will remain banned, however. Authorities had to declare a “major incident” in Bournemouth, England, and surrounding areas on Thursday, after thousands gathered on beaches there and flouted social distancing rules. Thursday may have been one of the hottest days of 2020 in England. Officials threatened to close beaches in response to the influx of visitors. By Rick Noack AD AD June 26, 2020 at 7:16 AM EDT Trump ‘wasted his chance’ to show leadership on coronavirus, Wall Street Journal editorial says In a blistering editorial warning that President Trump could face a “historic repudiation” in November, the Wall Street Journal criticizes him for having “wasted his chance to show leadership” on the coronavirus pandemic and says his “default now is defensive self-congratulation.” The staunchly conservative Journal editorial board, which at times has not pulled its punches in assessing Trump’s presidency, writes that his record in fighting the coronavirus “is better than his critics claim after a bad start in late February and March” and credits him for mobilizing federal forces to help hard-hit states. “But he wasted his chance to show leadership by turning his daily pandemic pressers into brawls with the bear-baiting press and any politician who didn’t praise him to the skies,” the editorial says . “Lately he has all but given up even talking about the pandemic when he might offer realism and hope about the road ahead even as the country reopens. His default now is defensive self-congratulation.” The Journal also faults Trump for failing to provide “firm but empathetic leadership after the death of George Floyd” and says that Trump may soon need another nickname for Joe Biden other than “Sleepy Joe.” “How does President-elect sound?” the editorial asks.

By John Wagner AD AD June 26, 2020 at 6:56 AM EDT Toilet paper limits reintroduced as panic buying returns to Australia Supermarkets in Australia have been forced to reintroduce limits on toilet paper and other goods to stop a fresh wave of customers from bulk buying unnecessarily. The recent panic is believed to have been triggered by a surge in coronavirus cases in the southeastern state of Victoria. Woolworths supermarkets announced Friday the reintroduction of a limit of two packs per customer on toilet paper and paper towels in all stores following “a recent surge in demand.” The Coles supermarket chain also implemented buying restrictions on toilet paper, rice, flour and sugar. Compared with other countries, Australia has had better success in containing the virus, with 7,595 confirmed cases and 104 deaths. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday that Australia’s handling of the virus has been “remarkable,” but he added that there were “some challenges” in Victoria, citing the recent outbreak. Victoria recorded 30 new cases overnight, the 10th consecutive day of double-digit rises. Other Australian regions have reported none or single-digit daily cases in recent weeks. Mass testing is taking place in identified hot-spot areas, and the army is being deployed to assist the operation. Morrison described the behavior of those engaging in panic buying as “ridiculous.” Photos shared on Twitter this week showed empty shelves in grocery aisles in Sydney and Melbourne, as fears of a second wave seemingly spread across the country. Seriously Melbourne? Is toilet paper stockpiling back? This is a Woolworths at Craigieburn Plaza right now (Wednesday morning). pic.twitter.com/Ogbifw89Nk — Paul Dowsley (@pauldowsley7) June 24, 2020   Other countries have also been rocked by toilet paper shortages, forcing shops across Europe to impose limits during the peak of the pandemic. In April, a British critical care nurse broke down in a video shared on Facebook in which she pleaded with people to stop panic buying. “It’s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you’re at your lowest,” she begged. “Just stop it.” By Jennifer Hassan AD AD June 26, 2020 at 6:45 AM EDT Biden says he would require Americans to wear masks in public Joe Biden said Thursday that if he were president, he would mandate that every American wear a mask in public to combat the spread of the coronavirus. In an interview with KDKA , the CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh, the presumptive Democratic nominee said he would attempt to leverage federal power to mandate mask wearing. “The one thing we do know is these masks make a gigantic difference,” he said. “I would insist that everybody out in public be wearing that mask. Anyone to reopen would have to make sure that they walked into a business that had masks.” When asked whether that meant using executive actions to try to require such actions, Biden said he would use the power of the office. “Yes, I would,” he said. “From an executive standpoint, yes, I would.” Asked if that meant he would be effectively mandating that all Americans wear a mask, he responded by saying, “I would do everything possible to make it required that people had to wear masks in public.” By Matt Viser AD AD June 26, 2020 at 6:43 AM EDT White House task force plans first news briefing in nearly two months, with no plans for Trump to attend With record-breaking numbers of new cases sweeping the United States, the White House coronavirus task force is scheduled Friday to hold its first news briefing in nearly two months. This one, however, will not be held at the White House, and it does not appear that President Trump, who was a fixture in the briefing room in the early days of the crisis, will be present. Friday’s briefing is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. at the Department of Health and Human Services, with Vice President Pence, the leader of the task force, presiding. Trump’s daily schedule released by the White House makes no mention of plans to attend. The president is scheduled to receive an intelligence briefing at 11:45 a.m. and has no plans to leave the White House until later in the afternoon, when he will head to his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for the weekend. That trip has drawn scrutiny because Trump does not plan to abide by a new travel advisory in New Jersey and nearby states that are telling anyone coming from places hit hard by the coronavirus to self-quarantine for 14 days. Trump traveled earlier this week to Arizona, among the states designated as hot spots by the governors of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York when they announced their quarantine period Wednesday. “Anyone traveling in support of the president this weekend will be closely monitored for symptoms and tested for COVID and therefore pose little to no risk to the local populations,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.

By John Wagner and Colby Itkowitz AD AD June 26, 2020 at 6:22 AM EDT Local governments eye new taxes to make up for massive budget shortfalls Cash-starved cities and states across the country are starting to weigh whether to raise taxes on homes, cigarettes, local businesses and global tech giants, hoping to rake in new revenue that might help them close the massive budget shortfalls created by the pandemic. The increases that have been proposed — and in some cases adopted — reflect growing desperation on the part of government leaders nationwide. Many have found that recent spending cuts, furloughs and layoffs have not been enough to shore up their sagging finances , forcing them to consider more politically noxious and economically risky moves in the middle of an economic crisis. “No politician wants to lead with raising taxes,” said Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “When they get there, it’s because they’ve run out of other options.” Read more here . By Tony Romm AD AD June 26, 2020 at 6:12 AM EDT Singapore punishes British men for illegal bar-hopping Singapore has banned a group of British expatriates from working in the country after they broke lockdown rules by visiting multiple bars in the city center in mid-May. The men visited three bars, all of which were serving takeout beverages to customers, authorities said. Prosecutors said the men participated in an illegal meeting while a pandemic “circuit breaker” was in effect, preventing social gatherings. The men were accused of standing less than one meter (about three feet) apart and not wearing face masks during their time bouncing between the bars, a trek that lasted about 45 minutes, authorities said. An attorney for the British men objected to the “bar crawl description,” the BBC reported . The men narrowly avoided jail and were fined the equivalent of about $6,500 each. A photo showing crowds sitting in proximity and drinking in the area during the same night went viral after it was shared on Facebook by a user named Lectress Pat, who accused those photographed of jeopardizing local and front-line efforts to slow the virus. The photo sparked outrage, with many calling for those flouting the rules to be punished. The next day, 10 restaurants in the area were banned from selling takeout alcohol, local media reported. According to the Singapore Ministry of Manpower, more than 100 people have had their permission to work in the country revoked for breaking lockdown rules that were enacted in early April. In May, a U.S. pilot was sentenced to four weeks in jail after leaving his Singapore hotel room to buy medical supplies. Brian Dugan Yeargan of Alaska was the first foreigner imprisoned in the country for the crime of breaching the stay-at-home notice, although Singaporeans have also been charged in recent months. By Jennifer Hassan AD AD June 26, 2020 at 6:07 AM EDT Swedish state epidemiologist pushes back against WHO after it issues warning over virus resurgence Swedish state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has pushed back against a World Health Organization warning Thursday that the country is one of several that are seeing a “significant resurgence” of their coronavirus outbreaks. Speaking to Sweden’s public broadcaster, Tegnell said the WHO warning was based on a false reading of available data on cases in Sweden. Coronavirus cases have been rising again lately in Sweden, with the number of daily new infections jumping from more than 700 in late April to over 1,500 on some days now. But the Swedish official who has shaped the country’s controversial pandemic response said increased testing was behind the rising figures. ICU admissions, Tegnell added, are down, for instance. On Thursday, WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge warned that infections have risen in 30 European countries over the past two weeks. He cited a “very significant resurgence” in 11 countries that could “push health systems to the brink once again” if left unchecked. One of those countries is Sweden, according to the WHO. “Last week, Europe saw an increase in weekly cases for the first time in months. For weeks I have spoken about the risk of resurgence as countries adjust measures,” Kluge said. “In several countries across Europe, this risk has now become a reality.” The WHO welcomed aggressive measures reintroduced in some regions of Germany, Portugal and other countries to contain local outbreaks. “This is very good news! Bravo to the authorities,” Kluge said in a statement. Meanwhile, Sweden was one of few countries that did not impose a lockdown during the first wave of the pandemic. Approval of the approach has been on the decline in the country in recent weeks, as Sweden now has one of the highest per capita death tolls in Europe. By Rick Noack and Adam Taylor June 26, 2020 at 5:52 AM EDT DeVos makes official her controversial plan to push virus aid to private schools Education Secretary Betsy DeVos partially retreated Thursday from her controversial position that states must share a larger percentage of their pandemic relief funding with private schools. But her new stance did little to mollify her critics, who said DeVos is still trying to strong-arm states into giving private schools far more of the available funding than Congress intended. On Thursday, DeVos codified her disputed interpretation of the law into a binding regulation that will take effect in a few days. The agency is expecting a court challenge, an aide to DeVos said.

By Laura Meckler June 26, 2020 at 4:56 AM EDT ‘Herd Immunity’ festival changes name after backlash A Wisconsin music festival originally billed as a “COVID Herd Immunity Fest” changed its name after people slammed the event on social media and at least one band pulled out. The three-day event is now called the “ Mini July Fest .” In a statement on Facebook , the Q & Z Expo Center in Ringle, Wis., said its venue can accommodate 10,000 concertgoers, but tickets will be sold to fill the grounds only to 20 percent capacity, or about 2,000 attendees, who will have “the choice and ability to social distance” at the event. “The Festival is also not called ‘Herd Immunity’ and the name no longer tied to any of our social media or promotion,” the statement said. Critics had blasted the festival for making light of the pandemic. At least one festival band, Nonpoint, decided to cancel . Herd immunity occurs when a large enough portion of a population has been exposed to a virus, through infection or immunization, that the virus no longer spreads easily. But public health experts have cautioned that herd immunity is not a viable option to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which cannot yet be prevented with a vaccine.

By Katie Shepherd June 26, 2020 at 4:15 AM EDT Pride protesters arrested in Manila for allegedly violating quarantine MANILA — Around 20 people were arrested during a Pride Month protest in the Philippines for supposedly violating quarantine protocol, organizers said Friday, the latest in over 100,000 arrests in one of the longest and most stringent lockdowns in the world. Bahaghari, a left-leaning LGBTQ organization, maintained that the rally was peaceful and its attendees maintained social distancing. Attendees called for mass testing and protested an anti-terrorism bill that is widely seen as a crackdown on dissent. In a video posted by photographer JL Javier, police did not answer questions about the nature of the charges. “It’s clear that we’ve been arrested even though police can’t name our violations,” Bahaghari spokesperson Rey Valmores-Salinas said as the police vehicle pulled out. “They can’t name any, because there weren’t any.” Manila police later told The Washington Post that the protesters would be charged with “illegal assembly, non-cooperation during a health crisis, direct assault, and disobedience and resistance to a person in authority.” Sarah Elago, an activist and member of the House of Representatives, slammed the arrests as illegal. It was also condemned by other LGBTQ organizations, including the organizers of the annual Metro Manila Pride. The Philippines is home to a vibrant LGBTQ community, with the Pride March in Manila last year reportedly the largest in Southeast Asia. However, laws against discrimination and recognizing same-sex unions have languished in Congress. President Rodrigo Duterte’s coronavirus lockdown has eased in Manila, but government critics fear the pandemic is being used as a pretext to cut down on democratic freedoms. Galang Philippines, another organization championing LGBTQ rights, said it had recorded cases of same-sex couples being denied pandemic aid because they supposedly did not qualify under a traditional definition of a family. In April, three LGBTQ people were detained for curfew violation and made to kiss and dance by village officials on a Facebook live stream. By Regine Cabato June 26, 2020 at 3:55 AM EDT California governor declares budget emergency, allowing ‘rainy day fund’ to shore up shortfall California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a budget emergency in the state on Thursday, allowing state legislators to tap a “ rainy day fund ” to fill a budget shortfall created by the novel coronavirus pandemic. In early 2020, the fund contained about $17.5 billion . Before the pandemic, California expected to add about $3 billion to the state savings account by June. Instead, state senators voted Thursday to take $8 billion from the savings fund to help shore up a projected $54.3 billion budget deficit. The budget plan will be considered by the state assembly on Friday. The projected shortfall reflects lower-than-expected tax revenue after more than 6.7 million Californians filed for unemployment and businesses shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. The state also predicts that the pandemic will cost the state more than $13 billion by the end of the year, Reuters reported . California has reported more than 195,500 coronavirus cases and 5,733 deaths. By Katie Shepherd June 26, 2020 at 3:45 AM EDT Two Navy ships break record for days spent at sea to avoid coronavirus outbreaks Two U.S. Navy ships set a record Thursday after spending 161 days at sea, without taking port leave, to avoid an outbreak of the novel coronavirus among the crew. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, an aircraft carrier; and a guided-missile cruiser called the USS San Jacinto set off from Norfolk on Jan. 17. On Thursday, the ships broke the previous record, set in 2002, when the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt spent 160 days at sea following 9/11. Vice Adm. James Malloy suspended port liberty, which allows sailors to leave the ship when it docks, in March to maintain the fleet’s “warfighting readiness while ensuring the safety and well-being of our Sailors,” he said in a statement . The pandemic has posed challenges for Navy ships trying to maintain operations as the virus spreads around the world. The USS Theodore Roosevelt was forced to port in Guam earlier this year after an outbreak of covid-19 onboard. More than 1,100 sailors eventually tested positive for the coronavirus, including one who died. The ship again set sail in May. The Eisenhower and San Jacinto have avoided similar outbreaks by keeping sailors from leaving the ships. Although the constant sailing has kept the ships’ crews from contracting the virus, being at sea for more than five months has taken a toll on morale, sailors aboard the Eisenhower told NPR. “It’s a bittersweet feeling,” Bill Goldberg, a naval air crewman told NPR . “We’ll be in the Navy record book, but for something I’d never want to do again.” Stay safe and informed as the United States reopens with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter. By Katie Shepherd June 26, 2020 at 3:45 AM EDT Warner Bros. delays ‘Tenet’ again as coronavirus cases surge Warner Bros. is delaying its much-anticipated Christopher Nolan movie “Tenet” an additional two weeks to mid-August, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about them publicly. The studio confirmed the plans shortly after being contacted by The Washington Post. The move deals a serious blow to Hollywood’s hopes of salvaging its summer season, already badly damaged by the closure of movie theaters in response to the pandemic. The movie will now come out Wednesday Aug. 12 instead of July 31, as the studio hopes that the additional two weeks will allow the country to recover from the current surge in coronavirus cases while still offering enough time before the end of the summer.

By Steven Zeitchik June 26, 2020 at 2:45 AM EDT Fans will be allowed to attend the Kentucky Derby, with restrictions Churchill Downs announced Thursday that fans will be allowed to attend the Kentucky Derby, which has been moved from its original date in May to Sept. 5 because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The track will institute a number of operating procedures: Spectators are “encouraged” to wear masks over their noses and mouths, though Churchill Downs said this rule could change based on government guidance. Fans also will be encouraged to wash their hands for 20 seconds throughout the day. No paper tickets will be sold moving forward, though paper tickets sold for the original date of the race will be honored. All mobile tickets will need to be purchased online or over the phone. The track’s capacity of approximately 170,000 fans will be reduced to ensure adequate social distancing. General admission access will be limited to the infield area; such ticket holders will not be allowed in the “front side” or paddock areas of the facility. Specifics on the attendance reduction will be released in the near future, according to the Courier-Journal of Louisville. Food will be served to guests individually, and no buffets will be allowed.

By Matt Bonesteel June 26, 2020 at 2:10 AM EDT How Arizona ‘lost control of the epidemic’ PHOENIX — A drive-up testing site equipped for several hundred people in West Phoenix was swarmed on Saturday by about 1,000 people, leaving some baking in their cars for hours. A nearby testing station has already reached capacity for this weekend, appointments vanishing within minutes. Hospitals are filling up. Restaurants are again shutting down, more than a month after Arizona reopened its economy under the mantra “Return Stronger.” Arizona has emerged as an epicenter of the early summer coronavirus crisis as the outbreak has metastasized, flaring across new parts of the country and, notably, infecting more young people. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is recording as many as 2,000 cases a day, “eclipsing the New York City boroughs even on their worst days,” warned a Wednesday brief by disease trackers at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which observed, “Arizona has lost control of the epidemic.” Read more here . By Jeremy Duda, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Chelsea Janes June 26, 2020 at 1:40 AM EDT Trump administration asks Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court late on Thursday to overturn the Affordable Care Act, telling the court that “the entire ACA must fall.\" The administration’s argument comes as thousands of Americans have turned to the government program for health care as they’ve lost jobs amidst the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) denounced the move. “President Trump and the Republicans’ campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty,\" she said in a statement. The brief was filed in support of a challenge to the ACA by a coalition of Republican governors. Trump had pledged earlier this month to follow through on overturning Obamacare despite the ongoing pandemic. Read more here . By Tim Elfrink and Meagan Flynn June 26, 2020 at 1:02 AM EDT Mississippi health official ‘terrified’ by increase in coronavirus cases in his state Saying he is “terrified we will overwhelm the health-care system,” Mississippi’s state health officer is urging residents to wear masks and practice social distancing. Mississippi on Thursday reported 1,092 new cases of the novel coronavirus, the second time in four days the state has surpassed 1,000. There are 532 people hospitalized. “If we’re not careful, Mississippi will look like New York,” said epidemiologist Thomas Dobbs, according to the Clarion-Ledger . After four days without reporting any covid-19 deaths, the state said 78 people died of the virus in the past four days. “It’s not just the cases,” Dobbs said. “We have seen the highest number of hospitalized patients. I’m terrified we will overwhelm the health-care system, the hospitals, the ICUs. Not in the fall, I’m talking about this week.” The state’s stay-at-home order ended June 1. All businesses were allowed to reopen, including bars and movie theaters, with capacity limits and other guidelines.

By Steven Goff June 26, 2020 at 1:00 AM EDT D.C. remains cautious while neighboring county plans a move to Phase 2 Maryland’s Prince George’s County, which has been hard hit by the coronavirus , on Thursday moved toward reopening more businesses and permitting more social gatherings, while in neighboring Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel E. Bowser raised concerns about large holiday gatherings during the pandemic and said the city wouldn’t further relax restrictions anytime soon. “Our strong recommendation is that D.C. residents celebrate the Fourth of July at home or near their home in small gatherings,” Bowser (D) said, urging residents not to go to the Mall even though the Trump administration said it will set off the traditional fireworks there . “We hope that the crowds that come in non-pandemic years won’t materialize this year.” Although crowds have become a daily feature of the protests against police brutality in the District , which Bowser herself has joined, she said big groups are not recommended. “Large gatherings are still a high-risk activity, so if you’re outdoors, that’s still a high-risk activity,” she said.

Schneider June 26, 2020 at 12:57 AM EDT Treasury sent more than 1 million coronavirus stimulus payments to dead people, congressional watchdog finds The federal government sent coronavirus stimulus payments to almost 1.1 million dead people totaling nearly $1.4 billion, Congress’s independent watchdog reported Thursday. The Washington Post previously reported that the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service disbursed some payments of up to $1,200 each to dead people. But the astonishing scope of the problem had not been known. The Government Accountability Office, an independent investigative agency that reports to Congress, issued the finding as part of a comprehensive report on the nearly $3 trillion in coronavirus relief spending approved by Congress in March and April. It said it had received the information from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration in an accounting as of April 30. Read more here . By Erica Werner June 26, 2020 at 12:40 AM EDT The Marine Corps Marathon is still on (for now). But there will be less time to finish. Wednesday’s announcement that the Oct. 25 Marine Corps Marathon would go on as scheduled was a surprise to many, especially as it came amid a wave of cancellations of major fall marathons. New York City had thrown in the towel just minutes earlier. The announcement also contained an unwelcome surprise for some runners: They will have less time to finish. Longtime race director Rick Nealis said the change is one of many his team is agonizing over in trying to reinvent the iconic race in a way that will mitigate the chance of spreading covid-19 .

Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) said Thursday the state is not ready to enter the next phase of reopening businesses. “We’re not doing as good a job keeping the virus in check,” New Mexico Human Services Secretary David Scrase said in a video conference. “We have to be even more careful.” State health officials, the Albuquerque Journal reported , are weighing whether to reimpose more stringent health orders and increase enforcement of wearing masks in public. The state is also considering quarantine orders for visitors arriving in vehicles, not just on planes. According to data compiled by The Washington Post , New Mexico has seen a steady rise in new cases this week, including 202 on Thursday. Bars remain closed, but since June 1, restaurants have been allowed to offer dine-in services at 50 percent capacity and with additional guidelines. Salons and barbershops were allowed to reopen at 25 percent capacity. Stay safe and informed as the United States reopens with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter. By Steven Goff June 26, 2020 at 12:10 AM EDT Analysis: Latin America’s coronavirus crisis is only getting worse In many parts of the world, authorities and experts are fretting over the onset of a coronavirus second wave. Yet in the Americas, there’s still no end in sight to the first. The virus is surging in various U.S. states , and the American death toll has eclipsed 120,000. On Thursday, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the real number of infected Americans is probably 10 times the 2.3 million official count . But to the United States’ south, things are looking all the more concerning. Across Latin America, cases have tripled in the space of a month . The region, which is home to just 8 percent of the world’s population, accounted for about half of global coronavirus-related deaths in the past two weeks and surpassed the unfortunate milestone of 100,000 fatalities this week. According to a new projection by researchers , that figure could reach close to 400,000 by October. The largest numbers are in Brazil and Mexico, the two most populous countries in the region. In both instances, governments in charge played down the scale of the threat and are desperately playing catch-up. Official counts of infections and coronavirus-linked deaths are probably lower than the actual numbers. Mass testing initiatives have struggled to get off the ground , while shutdown skeptics who suggested herd immunity could take root have little evidence to justify their optimism. Read more here .
